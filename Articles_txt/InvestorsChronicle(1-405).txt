Wizz Air's (WIZZ) strong first-half results were in a similar vein to those recently posted by Ryanair (IE:RYA) and 
EASYJET (EZJ). Strong top-line growth was underpinned by a jump in passenger numbers (up 25 per cent), higher 
ticket prices (up 17 per cent) and a hike in ancillary revenues (up 28 per cent).
Moreover, despite the ramp-up in activity, the company's ex-fuel costs fell slightly, as the levels of disruption faced 
and the amount of compensation payments made for cancelling flights during the disruption that was particularly 
pronounced last summer fell, although the airline faced a rebuke from the UK's regulator in July for rejecting 
passengers' legitimate refund claims.
Wizz is facing more upheaval, too, given engine maker Pratt & Whitney's recall of its GTF engines. The company 
expects to ground 45 aircraft by its March year-end, but said it had "secured a comprehensive compensation 
support package" to pay for this, and it has extended leases on other aircraft, meaning second-half capacity will still 
be 20 per cent higher than last year. However, it made a downside adjustment to its full-year net profit guidance, 
shaving (EURO)50mn (£43.6mn) off the top end of its revised estimate of (EURO)350mn-(EURO)400mn.Net debt 
was also largely unchanged since its March year-end and remains substantial at (EURO)3.89bn.
Wizz Air's shares have fallen in value by 39 per cent since we published our sell idea in mid-June, and although a 
price of just under seven times FactSet's consensus forecast earnings may now look tempting to bargain hunters, 
we still think they're too much of a risk given the company's aggressive expansion plans. There are more enticing 
opportunities on offer elsewhere among the low-cost carriers. Sell.

The share prices of many low-cost airlines have taken a hit over the past three months as investor concerns about 
the durability of travel demand in a tougher economic climate have grown. But management at Ryanair (IE:RYA) is 
bullish as ever - announcing that the airline will pay a maiden ordinary dividend of (EURO)400mn (£347mn) this 
year, and distribute 25 per cent of its post-tax profit from 2025 onwards.
Although the company has a huge order of 300 new Boeings to pay for, chief executive Michael O'Leary said it was 
generating strong enough profits and cash flows to allow for sustained payouts. Revenue for the six months ending 
in September rose by 30 per cent to (EURO)8.6bn and earnings per share jumped by 72 per cent to (EURO)1.91, 
with passenger numbers, ticket prices and ancillary revenues all advancing at double-digit levels.
Third-quarter bookings are also expected to be stronger than last year, and the company said full-year post-tax 
profit is expected to be between (EURO)1.85bn and (EURO)2.05bn, which at its mid-point is about 7 per cent 
higher than the current consensus, according to Deutsche Bank analysts.
Over the longer term, the company thinks capacity in the European short-haul market will continue to be 
constrained for at least two years given the difficulty manufacturers are having in delivering planes and engine 
maker Pratt & Whitney's need to conduct hundreds of recalls of its GTF engines (Ryanair's planes are not affected). 
Chief executive Michael O'Leary also pointed to merger activity among European airlines, saying consolidation was 
needed to "get rid of these flaky, perennial lossmakers".
Ryanair's shares jumped 6 per cent and trade at 10 times broker Peel Hunt's forecast earnings for next March's 
year-end, falling to nine times for the following year. Given its track record and potential to continue grabbing more 
market share, we see this as decent value and justification for our buy call.

The bumper sales enjoyed by low-cost carriers flying holidaymakers to Europe's hotspots may not be as easy to 
replicate next year, as cost of living pressures and capacity increases are set to weigh on demand.
Although easyJet (EZJ) recorded what chief executive Johan Lundgren described as "the best summer" in the 
company's history last week, its shares fell by 10 per cent over the following two days as analysts cast doubt on its 
ability to maintain robust pricing levels.
"I think 2024 will be a harder year than 2023, there's no doubt about that," said John Grant, a senior analyst at 
aviation analytics company OAG.
Countries began reopening airspace from pandemic lockdowns at different times and in the US, where travel 
recommenced earlier, the "revenge spending" patterns of heightened travel are winding down, Grant said.
Travellers there have burned through excess savings and pent-up demand "is being exhausted", he added.
"We're about six months behind that," Grant said.
Low-cost carriers such as easyJet, Jet2 ( JET2), Ryanair (IE:RYA) and Wizz Air (WIZZ) have enjoyed much 
stronger pricing power and have been quicker out of the blocks than some of the debt-hobbled legacy airlines in 
capitalising on this.
Europe's low-cost airlines face stronger headwinds Budget airlines continue to add capacity despite signs of 
softening demand. Michael Fahy reports
Although total European air traffic was still only at 93.5 per cent of pre-pandemic levels last month, according to 
Eurocontrol, low-cost carriers have boosted capacity. Wizz Air's capacity at the end of June was at 164 per cent of 
pre-pandemic levels, while Ryanair's was at 123 per cent.
In a full-year trading update last week, easyJet said its capacity at the end of September was a fifth higher than at 
the same period in 2019. And both higher passenger numbers and a 9 per cent increase in ticket yields helped the 
airline to post a 42 per cent growth in revenue for the year to £8.2bn, while operating profit moved from breakeven 
in the previous year to £470mn.
EasyJet plans to increase capacity over the next three months by 15 per cent, Jet2 has increased its winter 
capacity by more than a fifth and Ryanair's capacity is set to increase by around 11 per cent, despite planemaker 
Boeing (US:BA) delaying some deliveries.
Yet, as low-cost airlines continue their growth push - particularly into high-demand routes on the Mediterranean - 
there are signs that demand is cooling.
"Our experts believe competition is going to intensify as other airlines look to expand their network to popular 
leisure destinations," said Olly Anibaba, an analyst at Third Bridge.
Fuel costs are another concern. EasyJet reported a 40 per cent increase in fuel costs per seat for the year to 
September to £21.95, or around 29 per cent of its total cost per seat. Although the company expects to be able to 
hold down ex-fuel costs and has hedged 73 per cent of its fuel costs for its new financial year, this is at a higher 
rate, and when currency headwinds are added in, its fuel cost per seat is expected to increase by about 15 per 
cent, chief financial officer Kenton Jarvis told analysts last week.
Ruairi Cullinane, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that some airlines expect that they will be able to continue 
passing on cost increases through higher fares given the inflationary environment, but the less favourable supply-
demand balance - particularly in the UK, where consumers are facing greater cost of living pressures - means this 
might not be possible.
"Suppressed airline valuation multiples suggest the market is pricing in steeper fare declines," he said. Indeed, after 
a 50 per cent gain in value during the first half of this year, easyJet's shares have slumped by 20 per cent over the 
past three months and are currently priced at seven times FactSet consensus earnings. Ryanair shares are priced 
at eight times forecast earnings, but Jet2 shares are priced at just six times and Wizz shares at a lowly 5.6 times.
Grant said that when compared with the US, where four major players dominate, the European airline industry is 
still highly fragmented.
This is slowly changing, following Lufthansa's (DE:LHA) acquisition of Italy's state airline ITA Airways in May and Air 
France-KLM's (FR:AF) purchase this month of a 20 per cent stake in Scandinavian Airlines (as part of a 
recapitalisation led by US private equity firm Castlelake).
More consolidation is needed, but there are still "so many sacred cows" when it comes to former flag carriers, he 
said.
"It's not a necessity that you have your own national airline - it's an ego trip."

This week, the Department for Business and Trade announced it would crack down on hidden fees in products 
ranging from train tickets to takeaways, as it launched a consultation exercise on proposals to weed out 'drip 
pricing'. This is where the price paid is higher than originally advertised due to additional fees, such as paying to 
choose a seat on a plane or carry on more than a small bag.
These practices are most prevalent among companies in the entertainment (54 per cent using drip pricing), 
hospitality (56 per cent) and transport and communications sectors (72 per cent), the department said, adding that 
consumers were spending £1.6bn a year on these fees.
Analysis of transactions on more than 500 mobile apps found 41 per cent contained dripped fees deemed to cause 
harm - these included mandatory, pre-selected or optional charges presented more than halfway through the 
checkout process, costing more than 25 per cent of the initial price or processes containing three or more dripped 
fees. It deemed fees charged by airlines for extra luggage or for fasttrack access as harmful as although these are 
optional they are costly relative to the base price and take place late in the buying process. "Unclear pricing of 
products does not suit the consumer," said Kevin Hollinrake, minister for enterprise, markets and small business. 
"We cannot have efficient markets without price transparency."
Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, described the consultation as "hugely 
welcome" and said it would shine a light on some of the sharper practices engaged in by some airlines, such as

charging customers big fees if they have forgotten to print boarding cards. However, Peel Hunt analyst Alexander 
Paterson said that for the transport sector, the measures were "a complete waste of time".
Companies generally offer a menu of services that are "entirely transparent", he said, meaning customers who do 
not need to bring luggage are not forced to pay for it. He also argued that fees charged through aggregators such 
as Trainline (TRN) can be avoided by booking directly with train operators.
David Reynolds, an analyst with stockbroker Davy, said the government would face difficulties in getting low-cost 
carriers such as EASYJET (EZJ) and Ryanair (IE:RYA) to alter their pricing models, given that they work on "fairly 
thin margin profiles". The government's example of 'fake' optional fees include charges for luggage on long-haul 
flights, which may not impact short-haul specialists easy- Jet and Ryanair.
The government is also looking to ban the buying and selling of fake reviews and to make website owners 
responsible for making sure comments "reflect genuine consumer experiences".
This could be an issue for review platform Trustpilot (TRST), which has been a target for groups trading fake 
reviews, according to consumer title Which?
A Trustpilot spokesperson welcomed the consultation, saying that it removed around 5 per cent of the reviews 
submitted to its platform last year on suspicion of being fake.
Reynolds at Davy argued that fake reviews were "a trivial issue" for the company compared with some of the more 
significant business challenges that it faces.
Trustpilot is trying to crack a US market dominated by tech giants such as Amazon (US:AMZN) and Google and is 
continuing to rack up losses. Its share price has plunged by 68 per cent since its 2021 stock market listing and it 
recently drafted in ex-Just Eat chief operating officer Adrian Blair as chief executive to replace founder Peter Holten 
Mühlmann.
The main risk the business faces is that the corporate customers it charges for hosting reviews consider the service 
"a nice to have rather than a must", Reynolds said.
"If the cyclical downturn gathers momentum then I think the discretionary dynamic of Trustpilot spend will perhaps 
become much more clear."

hat are the chances of Wizz Air's (WIZZ) share price quadrupling over the next five years? Currently, it's somewhat 
under £30, but if it reaches £119.34 in March 2028, or touches it in two consecutive quarters before that, then its 
chief executive would become £100mn better off. Even at £77.24, he'd be in for a more modest (but frankly 
outrageous) £65mn. Not bad for someone who has received an average £1.9mn a year for the past 10 years.
"We have a unique and worldclass leader in our chief executive, József Váradi, who has led the business through a 
period of strong growth since IPO and, despite the recent external environment, has continued to create the 
strongest and one of the most profitable airlines in the world," the directors say in the 2023 annual report. 
Apparently, it was because they heard that Váradi was being tempted by job offers that they came up with the 
£100mn carrot.
This is higher than even the (EURO)99mn (£85mn) of share options that had previously been dangled in front of 
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair (IE:RYA). Both boards were prepared to pay whatever it took to keep 
them. Proxy advisers warned about poor governance, but shareholders backed the proposals anyway.
Váradi claims that "Wizz Air is
the fastest growing ultra-low-cost carrier and one of the most sustainable European airlines". He had only been in 
the business for a couple of years when he co-founded the company in Hungary in 2003. The group has since 
expanded beyond central Europe into parts of Asia. Wizz listed in London in 2015 and, with Brexit looming, it set up 
a UK subsidiary that took over landing slots from the near-defunct Monarch Airlines. Today, it operates a fleet of 
What's wrong at Wizz Air?; The rosy picture painted by the 2023 annual report calls for scepticism. Paul 
Jackson reports No Free Lunch
179 aircraft, connecting 228 destinations across 56 countries, which Váradi intends to increase to 500 aircraft 
before the end of the decade.
The annual report says that the group provides "a frictionless digital customer experience and efficient, data-driven 
operations… A team of dedicated aviation professionals delivers superior service and very low fares". Wizz Air, it 
goes on, is "the preferred choice of over 51mn passengers". The target is to grow this number to 170mn, an annual 
growth rate of 15-20 per cent in seat capacity - made possible in part because "key performance indicators deliver 
best-in-class metrics around minimal flight cancellations".
At this point, we need to get back to reality. Aggressive growth has racked up massive debts and management 
issues, made worse by
Covid lockdowns, in the depths of which Váradi formed an Abu Dhabi joint venture. Despite the atrocities reported 
in Ukraine, Wizz then announced that flights to Moscow would resume from October 2022. Being ultra-low-cost 
involves high charges for extras such as baggage, and resisting making refunds - Wizz had more delays than any 
other airline in both 2021 and 2022, and its poor service generated twice the number of complaints. A weak Civil 
Aviation Authority left aggrieved customers having to resort to the courts, and even then Wizz delayed coughing up. 
In February, Which? ranked it the worst out of 23 shorthaul airlines.
As is often the case, service issues are exposed when technology fails. Online check-ins are free, yet passengers 
have been charged over £40 to check in at airports unless they had a screenshot to prove that the website was 
down. The secret to being ultralow-cost, Váradi said in 2018, is to "outsource everything like ground operations, 
aircraft maintenance, accounting and many other administrative areas. We think that other people can do a better 
job than us in those areas". It sounds as though he and his team have fallen into the trap of assuming that 
outsourcing need not be managed.
Which? reports that over 2 per cent of Wizz flights (scaling this up suggests about 1mn passengers) were over 
three hours late; 98 per cent were not, but that's hardly any consolation for those affected. In fairness, many 
customers say their flights went as planned. A bit crowded maybe, and uncomfortable seats, but you get what you 
pay for. Wizz claims that its service has improved. Employees have been told that the future is PINK (Punctual, 
Innovative, New and Knowledgeable) but some still feel exploited. One told The Times that the culture was "greed 
at the top and a squeeze at the bottom in pursuit of a pumped-up share price".
Perhaps being ultra-low-cost means that reputation is not such an issue. You could argue that things can only get 
better. Maybe they will.
£100MN IF WIZZ AIR'S SHARE PRICE REACHES £119.34 IN MARCH 2028, OR TOUCHES IT IN TWO 
CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS BEFORE THAT, ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE WOULD BECOME £100MN BETTER OFF

Both Airbus (FR:AIR) and Boeing (US:BA) have struggled to meet production targets, which has meant order 
backlogs have grown to levels that are only just below the records set at the peak of the last cycle, according to 
Rob Morris, from consultancy Ascend by Cirium.
With order books already stretching into the 2030s, airlines are scrambling to secure planes. On the opening day of 
this week's Paris Air Show, Indian budget airline operator Indigo placed the biggest single order in aviation history - 
for 500 of Airbus's A320 narrowbody aircraft. This follows on from a 470-plane order split between Airbus and 
Boeing by Air India in February this year and a 300-plane deal between Boeing and Ryanair signed last month.
Airbus and Boeing both also upgraded their 20-year forecasts for the commercial aerospace market.
"To some extent, I wonder whether airlines are worried that they are going to be left on the rank when all the taxis 
have left, and therefore they're ordering aircraft now while they can," Morris said ahead of the trade show.
Airlines have expressed frustration with delays to plane deliveries, which have been blamed on both labour and 
supply chain shortages.
Holding pattern The International Air Transport Association's (IATA) director-general, Willie Walsh, said the plane 
makers "have been far too slow" in dealing with supply chain blockages. Delivery delays of up to six months per 
aircraft are "raising costs and limiting our ability to deploy aircraft", he told IATA's annual conference earlier this 
month.
Plane orders take off but manufacturing still sluggish Backlogs build as Airbus and Boeing struggle with supply 
chains. Michael Fahy reports
Boeing has been struggling with problems with several of its models. The grounding of its 737 Max after two fatal 
crashes meant the US planemaker was burning through billions of dollars of cash even before a global pandemic, 
which led to large-scale layoffs.
This meant it faced "a real shortage" of labour (especially production line engineers) as demand snapped back, 
explained Mathew Adamo, managing partner of advisory firm AIP Capital.
Labour shortages at castings and foundries have made it harder to source engine parts and some of the materials 
needed to make advanced alloys previously came from Russia, whose Ukraine invasion further upended supply 
chains, Adamo said.
Although Boeing's production rate is now picking up, it still only produced around 43 planes a month in the first 
quarter, compared with 67 prior to the Max groundings. Production rates for 737 narrowbodies, for which it has 
more than 3,600 orders, stood at just 31 a month in the first quarter, although the head of Boeing's commercial 
airplanes business Stan Deal told Bloomberg that he expects this to increase to 42 per month by the end of this 
year.
Airbus is also struggling to ramp up production of its A320 narrowbody family of jets - it recently pushed out a target 
of producing 75 A320s a month by a year to 2026. It produced 35 A320s per month in the first quarter, which 
increased to 47 a month by May.
Although RBC Capital Markets analysts have more confidence in Airbus's ability to execute its plans over the next 
three years, they still see "substantial risk" around its revised targets.
Much of the focus so far has been on engine parts, but it expects "persistent delays in the areas of electronics and 
interiors" both this year and next.
This matters to the UK market. The industry's pre-show backlog of 13,401 orders is worth around £200bn to the UK 
economy, according to Aimie Stone, chief economist with trade body ADS.
Engineering group Senior (SNR) said in an April trading update that ongoing supply chain challenges meant its 
revenue would be "more weighted to the second half of the year". House broker Numis said a "strong recovery" in 
commercial aerospace by 2025 could boost its earnings per share by 70 per cent by then. Aerospace revenues are 
"generally on an improving trend" for Bodycote (BOY), according to RBC Capital Markets' Mark Fielding.
Both, however, remain reliant on the improving performance of the major plane makers, whom Cirium's Morris 
pointed out had been failing to meet rate targets even before a global pandemic hit. He does not expect a full 
supply chain recovery until 2026.
Rolls-Royce (RR.) or Melrose (MRO) may seem like a better recovery play, as both have a significant portion of 
revenues linked to engine flying hours, which should continue to rebound regardless of manufacturer build rates. 
Both have already witnessed share price gains of almost 70 per cent since the start of the year, though - Rolls-
Royce shares now trade at 24 times FactSet consensus forecast earnings and Melrose's shares are at 27 times.

Ryanair (IE:RYA) has reported higher passenger numbers compared with pre-Covid-19 levels for its financial year 
ending 31 March, taking it back into the black. The company made a pre-tax profit of (EURO)1.44bn (£1.25bn) as 
revenue more than doubled to (EURO)10.8bn. Passenger numbers were up 74 per cent year on year to 168.6mn, 
which was 13 per cent higher than before the pandemic.
Fares were also 10 per cent higher versus 2019, and the airline's fuel bill in its current financial year is around 
(EURO)1bn higher than last year, given that it has hedged around 85 per cent of its fuel costs at a higher rate of 
$89 per barrel.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the company had made market share gains in Italy, Poland, Ireland and other 
countries across Europe where "incumbent carriers, or carriers who went bust or cut capacity during Covid, have 
withdrawn from the marketplace".
The company is forecasting a further 10 per cent increase in passengers in its current financial year, given "strong" 
summer booking levels. "There's no doubt in my mind that the underlying driver of the strong forward bookings and 
strong earnings this summer has been the short-haul capacity constraints in Europe," he said. Ryanair estimates 
that industry-wide short-haul capacity will still only be around 90-95 per cent of pre-Covid levels this summer.
Last week, Ryanair signed a new deal with manufacturer Boeing to take delivery of 300 new 737 Max-10 planes, 
with deliveries starting from 2027.
Around half of the planes will replace older models in its fleet and the other half will be deployed on new routes as it 
looks to grow passenger numbers to 300mn by 2034.
Ryanair returns to full-year profit
Demand for European summer travel "looks robust and is expected to be inelastic", as consumers prioritise travel 
over other forms of entertainment, said Olly Anibaba, an analyst at Third Bridge.
"The real test for Ryanair will be the off-peak periods, especially in winter. To fill up its planes, Ryanair might have 
to offer discounts."
168.6MN PASSENGER NUMBERS AT RYANAIR WERE UP 74 PER CENT YEAR ON YEAR TO 168.6MN, 
WHICH WAS 13 PER CENT HIGHER THAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC

Europe's airlines are set for a much more profitable summer as pent-up demand for travel translates into higher 
ticket prices and airport capacity restrictions continue to ease.
The stronger outlook for fares, coupled with lower fuel costs, led BofA Securities analyst Muneeba Kayani to 
increase operating profit targets for the continent's major airlines by 14 per cent. Airline bosses should report much 
stronger bookings for summer in a series of upcoming earnings calls and are "unlikely" to pass on savings they 
stand to make on jet fuel, which has fallen in price by around 17 per cent since the start of the year, Kayani said.
Low-cost carrier EASYJET (EZJ) led the way this week, saying pre-tax profit in the year to September would be 
ahead of current market expectations of £260mn, which itself is an uplift from the £126mn it was expected to 
generate in January.
The company, which last summer incurred £133mn of disruption costs as it compensated passengers for delayed 
or cancelled flights at overstretched hubs, said it will be back to pre-pandemic capacity levels this summer, having 
recently completed its "largest ever crew onboarding campaign". It flew around 1,600 flights a day during the Easter 
holidays, with capacity in the UK already back to pre-pandemic levels and yields ahead of where they were in 2019.
The recovery for low-cost carriers (LCCs) has been quicker than for former flag carriers such as BA-owner 
International Consolidated Airlines (IAG), Lufthansa (DE:LHA) and Air France-KLM (FR:AF), which have had to wait 
much longer for restrictions on long-haul flights to ease, particularly to China.
Higher ticket prices fuel airline profits Pent-up demand and capacity improvements are set to drive industry-
wide growth. Michael Fahy reports
Flexible flyers LCCs are pulling ahead of legacy competitors in Europe because "they operate a less complex 
business model, have greater flexibility in where they place their aircraft and price to create demand", noted John 
Grant, a senior analyst at flight data specialist OAG.
Still, "pricing levels for everyone are much higher", and legacy airlines have been more concerned with operating at 
a profit than bringing capacity back to pre-pandemic levels, he said.
Higher ticket prices meant a double-digit increase in revenue per passenger last year on 2019 levels, an analysis of 
UK and EU figures by CAPA - Centre for Aviation showed.
Moreover, the typical discount between low-cost carriers and legacy airlines has narrowed, the consultancy said in 
a report last month. UBS's European airline fare tracker estimates Ryanair prices were up 49 per cent in the first 
quarter and are 57 per cent higher for the second, compared with increases of 24 per cent and 30 per cent, 
respectively, for IAG.
Expectations of higher earnings have translated into strong share price gains. Among the LCCs, EASYJET shares 
are up 57 per cent since the start of the year, Wizz Air (WIZZ) shares are up 47 per cent and Ryanair (IE:RYA) 
shares are trading 30 per cent higher.
Of the legacy carriers, shares in IAG are up 16 per cent, while those in both Lufthansa and Air France-KLM are up 
by a quarter.
Despite these gains, only the latter two are trading above historic earnings multiples, Kayani notes.
The three legacy carriers are expected to report first-quarter earnings in early May and UBS analyst Jarrod Castle 
said he expects all of them to narrow losses given strong demand and tighter capacity.
Among the LCCs, Ryanair has a strategic position that is "much stronger" than its closest peer Wizz, which is 
planning to grow its current fleet of around 170 aircraft to 475-500 by 2030, according to HSBC analysts Achal 
Kumar and Joseph Thomas. This translates into 20 per cent compound annual growth in seat capacity.
"While this could lower its unit cost, the key question is whether the company can find enough markets to deploy so 
much capacity profitably. Also, we think that such huge capacity growth could be highly yield dilutive," the pair said.
This is because it is likely to involve finding and opening new bases at additional cost. In recent years, Wizz has 
opened a new base in Abu Dhabi and plans to enter the Saudi Arabian market to expand beyond Europe where it 
faces tough competition from Ryanair in countries such as Poland, Italy and Spain.
And even though the market is improving, its home region won't offer anything like the type of growth Wizz will need 
to fill so many new planes.
Flight numbers are forecast to hit 93 per cent of the 2019 level this year and 98 per cent next year, with a full 
recovery only expected by 2025. For the rest of the decade, average annual growth is expected to be around 1.5 
per cent, according to pan-European body Eurocontrol.

EasyJet EZJ 517p AIRLINES
The rebound in travel anticipated last year as the Omicron wave of the coronavirus subsided took a lot longer to get 
off the ground than anticipated, but we're getting there. In Europe, air traffic for the first three weeks of 2023 
reached 86 per cent of 2019 levels, according to Eurocontrol.
Low-cost carriers have been among the most active players. Ryanair's (IE:RYA) daily flight numbers last week were 
at 114 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.
EasyJet (EZJ) has been slower off the mark. Its daily flight numbers last week were only at 63 per cent of 2019 
levels, according to Eurocontrol.
Not all of this is its fault, and the airline has been unlucky in terms of the fact that two of its main hubs - London 
Gatwick and Amsterdam - imposed capacity restrictions last summer to cope with the ramp-up in activity. 
Amsterdam's limits are still in place until April.
The airline's first-quarter trading update, for the final three months of 2022, shows clear progress, though. While it 
recorded another three-figure headline loss of £133mn, this was a £100mn improvement on the Covid-disrupted 
period a year earlier. Passenger numbers grew by 47 per cent, and revenue per seat was up by 36 per cent. The 
average load factor (the ratio of passengers to available seats) rose by 10 per cent and ticket yield grew by 21 per 
cent.
EasyJet makes up for lost time; Stronger winter trading means full-year profit should beat expectations. Michael 
Fahy reports
On top of this, the company made more from add-ons - airline ancillary revenue also grew by 36 per cent, to £20.12 
per seat.
Its holidays arm (which launched at the end of 2019, but only really began operating in earnest last year) generated 
a £13mn profit, up from a loss of £1mn a year earlier. Demand from UK holidaymakers is strong, with 60 per cent of 
the summer holidays it had planned to sell already booked. This was based on the company growing customer 
numbers by 30 per cent this year, but given the response it has now lifted this target to 50 per cent.
Chief executive Johan Lundgren said that it expects losses during the winter "to reduce significantly" when 
compared with last year, meaning that over the 12 months to September it expects to beat the market's current 
consensus of a £126mn pre-tax profit.
Our buy idea on EASYJET last month looks well timed. Since then, the airline's shares have jumped by 50 per cent, 
and although they currently trade at almost 27 times FactSet's consensus forecast earnings - well above their five-
year average - the company is still in the early stages of its recovery. On next year's consensus forecast of around 
36p a share, they trade at a much more reasonable-looking 14 times earnings. We maintain our buy stance at 
517p.

• Well-placed at key hubs • More efficient fleet • High-margin holiday arm • Strong balance sheet • Recovery lags 
peers
E
asyJet (EZJ) chief executive Johan Lundgren hailed a "£1bn bounce back" on the publication of the airline's full-
year results last month, referring to a £1.1bn swing in 'Ebitdar' - the profitability metric favoured by the company, 
which not only strips out interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, but also plane leasing costs - to £569mn.
This certainly isn't a metric that investors should build a case around. At a statutory level, easyJet posted a pre-tax 
loss of £178mn in the year to 30 September.
Yet tracking Ebitdar over the course of last year at least demonstrates easyJet's progress. Disruption caused by the 
Omicron variant during the 2021-22 winter saw the company report an Ebitdar loss of £208mn in the six months to 
March. By the third quarter, it generated £103mn in Ebitdar and in the fourth quarter a record £674mn as the 
company continued to increase both the number of planes and passengers flown.
Holding pattern Although low-cost carriers in Europe have enjoyed a more robust restart than many other parts of 
the industry - intra-European air travel was at 86 per cent of pre-pandemic levels by November, according to air 
traffic control body Eurocontrol, while global air traffic remains at about 71 per cent - progress has hardly been 
smooth.
EasyJet breaks with the past The low-cost airline's focus on squeezing more profit from non-flight revenues 
looks smart. Michael Fahy reports IDEAS COMPANIES
Severe staffshortages led to some airports placing caps on flights to restrict passenger numbers. EasyJet was hit 
harder than most, given that curbs were put in place at two of its
main hubs - London Gatwick and Amsterdam Schiphol. And while most airports have now lifted restrictions, they 
remain in place at Schiphol until next March.
The airline also struggled to build its own capacity in a tight labour market and incurred £133mn of "disruption 
costs" in the third quarter, as it compensated passengers for delayed or cancelled flights.
As a result, the airline's "bounce back" hasn't been as convincing as some of its peers. The 46.3mn passengers 
carried in the six months to September was 15 per cent lower than in the same period in 2019. By contrast, Ryanair 
(IE:RYA) carried 11 per cent more passengers than in the same period in 2019. Wizz (WIZZ), meanwhile, carried 
20 per cent more - due in part to a huge (and costly) expansion.
Lundgren told investors last month that its capacity will expand by 15 per cent this financial year, returning to pre-
pandemic levels by the fourth quarter. As it grows beyond this level over the next few years, it aims to do so more 
efficiently, by replacing about 40 per cent of the 94 Airbus A319 planes it currently has in service over the next three 
years with newer A320neo and A321neo models. An A321neo can carry around 50 per cent more passengers than 
an A319 and burns roughly the same amount of fuel, while an A320 can increase passenger capacity by a fifth.
Brand health score This will help to address a key analyst concern with easyJet - that for a low-cost carrier, its
costs aren't low enough. The airline's unit cost per seat (excluding fuel) was £52.66 last year, compared with 
(EURO)30 (£26.20) for Ryanair.
Fuel costs, of course, remain elevated, but other than hedge its exposure there is little it can do. Fortunately, 74 per 
cent of its fuel requirements to March and 51 per cent to next September are hedged at prices that are below the 
current European spot rate of $950 (£786) per metric tonne.
Seating surcharge There's no doubt that the addition of new planes will increase costs in the short term, though. 
With 51 new planes due to join the fleet over the next three years, easyJet is forecasting an increase in capital 
expenditure from £900mn this year to £1.5bn next and £1.6bn in its 2025 financial year.
Higher costs are one reason why analysts at Bank of America expect the stock to underperform the sector. They 
estimate the airline's unit costs (excluding fuel) per seat will be 20 per cent higher this financial year than they were 
in 2019, and are concerned by the effects of an expected six-quarter economic contraction in the UK, easyJet's key 
market.
The cost argument needs to be put into perspective, though. Much of easyJet's operations are from "slot-
constrained" airports, such as Gatwick, Schiphol and Lisbon, at which operating costs are higher than smaller 
airports. Lundgren told analysts last month that easyJet has "a significant cost advantage" against both legacy 
airlines and low-cost peers at such locations. "A five-plane operation from Wizz can't compete with our 80-plane 
operation from Gatwick from a cost point of view," he said.
Moreover, these locations allow the company to charge a premium. In the three months to September, easyJet's 
average ticket revenue per passenger was (EURO)91.40 (£80.30), compared with (EURO)57.40 for Ryanair and 
(EURO)55.30 for Wizz, according to Gridpoint Consulting.
Landing fees EasyJet is also making more from ancillary revenues - charging for bag drops, airport transfers and so 
on. It generated £1.59bn-worth of these extras last year, a 59 per cent increase on pre-pandemic levels. A 
partnership with airline software specialist Datalex will help boost this further, by providing bundles of services to 
respond quickly to demand, as well as personalised offers that can generate higher yields, Lundgren said.

looks smart. Michael Fahy reports IDEAS COMPANIES
Low-cost carrier ticket and ancillary revenues One of the biggest profit drivers could prove to be its holidays arm, 
though. Although easyJet's a late arrival in this field - Jet2 (JET2) and British Airways have had associated holiday 
offers for years - margins outstripped peers' last year.
In its first full year of uninterrupted operations, easyJet's holidays arm generated a £35mn profit on £386mn of 
incremental revenue, from 1.1mn customers. It is already "well on the way" to delivering a medium-term pre-tax 
profit target of £100mn from UK-based customers, and other markets will soon be targeted.
The division has few overheads and 95 per cent of its cost base is variable. EasyJet already flies 3.1mn passengers 
on behalf of other tour operators, but it has the advantage of a "captive airline audience", which the airline believes 
should help reduce its marketing spend. And although it might not have the cost profile of a Ryanair or Wizz, 
easyJet has a better reputation, according to YouGov, which presumably means customers would be more willing 
to book a holiday through the airline.
Whether this will be enough to pull investors into the recovery story is hard to say. Tapping the stock market on 
numerous occasions for funding means easyJet shares have fallen in value by almost 75 per cent since the onset 
of the pandemic, but its balance sheet remains robust. Net debt stood at less than £700mn at September, and it is 
one of just two European airlines (along with Ryanair) to retain an investment-grade rating.
EasyJet's share price does not fully reflect the structural improvements the business has made, such as greater use 
of a seasonal pilots' contract that will make some routes more profitable, Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said in a 
recent note.
The onus is now on easyJet to meet FactSetcompiled consensus earnings forecasts of 52p a share by FY2025 as 
the larger, more efficient planes come into service. If these estimates are reasonable, two smoother years in the 
execution of its strategy could augur a significant share price re-rating.
While concerns about the UK economy are valid, easyJet could be a net beneficiary of travellers trading down from 
more exotic, longer-haul destinations. So long as it can avoid fresh pandemic-related disruption and keep improving 
revenue, its more efficient business model should mean it generates excess profits. If it achieves this, expect the 
company's shares to break clear from pandemic-related turbulence.
EASYJET'S SHARE PRICE DOES NOT FULLY REFLECT THE STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS THE 
BUSINESS HAS MADE

Jet2 JET2 924p AIM: TRAVEL & LEISURE • Operating profit up 42 per cent on pre-pandemic levels • Share price 
has dropped by 17 per cent this year
The revival in demand for air travel hasn't been smooth, but it's clear the low-cost operators have led the way. 
Although flight numbers within Europe were 13.1 per cent lower during the summer than in 2019, low-cost carriers 
have also taken a much bigger share - 33.7 per cent in September, up from 32 per cent in the same month three 
years ago. Ryanair (IE:RYA) operated more than 10 per cent of all flights across Europe in the first nine months of 
this year, according to intergovernmental body Eurocontrol.
Jet2 (JET2) has sensed its opportunity, agreeing an order with Airbus (FR:AIR) last month for 35 new A320neo 
aircraft, worth $3.9bn (£3.2bn) at list prices. This came with an option to extend to 71 aircraft worth up to $8bn on 
paper, although the company has "negotiated significant discounts".
These build on another order placed in 2021, meaning it has 98 firm orders and the possibility to extend to 146, 
providing "certainty of supply well into the next decade", the company said.
Placing these at a time when demand still significantly lags capacity is brave, but given the weakness of the 
balance sheets of many competitors, it makes sense. The company is once more throwing off enough cash to 
afford it. Cash flow from operations of £799mn generated during the half was higher than the £789mn figure for the 
whole of last year.
Jet2 soars on improving demand A major new plane order is a sign of the carrier's confidence.
Despite having to fork out £50mn in compensation to passengers affected by airport disruption, Jet2's operating 
profit of £517mn for the six months to September was a substantial improvement on the £170.4mn loss declared in 
the same period last year and a 42 per cent uplift on pre-pandemic levels.
This was partly due to it flying more planes - seat capacity was 14 per cent up on 2019 - but also doing so more 
profitably. Its flightonly ticket yield of £105 per passenger was 43 per cent higher than last year and 18 per cent 
ahead of pre-pandemic levels. It also made a higher margin on the package holidays it sold.
Household budgets are going to be stretched next year but customers will more likely seek low-cost bargains than 
abandon breaks altogether. Despite facing higher fuel and labour costs, Jet2 expects to beat analysts' full-year pre-
tax profit expectations. The company's shares rose by 3 per cent but are still 17 per cent lower in the year to date 
and at less than nine times forecast earnings are competitively priced. Buy.

It was a tale of two quarters for Wizz Air (WIZZ). The budget airline, which focuses on central and Eastern Europe 
and has expanded into the Middle East, said that operational performance "normalised" as the year went on, with 
flight cancellations and disruption returning to historical levels. Revenues in its second quarter (to 30 September) 
were up by 41 per cent against the pre-pandemic rate, with strong cash profits of (EURO)218mn (£188mn) 
recorded for the half-year. A pretty solid showing.
But a challenging first quarter, in which Wizz faced a doubling of fuel prices from pre-pandemic levels, together with 
the continuing impact of pandemic restrictions and supply chain disruption, cast a pall. And Wizz wasn't helped by 
the dollar's strength against the euro, given it reports in the latter currency. This dragged the company down to a 
significantly worse statutory loss, with an eye-watering 905 per cent increase taking the net foreign exchange loss 
to (EURO)269mn.
It is good news, then, that Wizz has changed tack on its former no-hedging policy around the dollar and jet fuel 
costs. The result of this policy is seen in the company's negative year-to-date share price performance against 
competitors such as EASYJET (EZJ) and Ryanair (RYA) due to its greater exposure to manic fuel prices. The 
company said that "given the sustained and ongoing volatility in commodity prices" it will reinstate jet fuel hedging 
(in line with peers from 2024 and will hedge its dollar exposure).
Peel Hunt analysts said that "with rapid fleet growth and a pivot to the Middle East, [Wizz] will continue to expand 
quickly, using its low cost base to increase market share". The shares trade at only four times the broker's financial 
year 2025 earnings forecast, which is notably undemanding. Hold. CA

Holiday retailer On the Beach (OTB) has had a tough couple of years, hit by the shutdown of the travel industry 
during the pandemic and by the disruption that has characterised the sector throughout this year. Its weak share 
price performance reflects this, shares having dropped by 65 per cent over the last 12 months.
In the company's latest results for the half-year to 31 March, revenue boomed by over 1,100 per cent to £53mn and 
the company's pre-tax loss narrowed significantly to £7mn as the business benefited from pent-up holiday demand, 
despite trading being impacted by the Omicron variant. Management said that it expects a return to profit in the 
second half of the year, and that summer bookings were more than a fifth higher than pre-pandemic levels.
But that was back in May. Since then, the cost of living crisis has really gotten going. Data provider GfK's consumer 
confidence index fell to a negative 44 for August, the worst since records began in 1974. It is unclear yet as to what 
extent this will hit On the Beach's top line. On the plus side, the company's biggest (according to broker Numis) seat 
supplier Ryanair hasn't fared as badly as others with flight disruption.
Founder and chief executive Simon Cooper is clearly bullish on the outlook for On the Beach. He picked up just 
under £2mn-worth of shares in the company on 19 August at 130p a share, through the closely associated 
Hawksford Trustees Jersey. This takes his holding to 5.6 per cent of total share capital.
Panmure Gordon analyst Alex Chatterton is more reticent about the company's fortunes. He said in a recent 
research note that while the shares look cheap compared with their pre-pandemic valuation, "there are structural 
issues such as its nearest peer Loveholidays now having a similar number of ATOL [Air Travel Organiser's Licence] 
passengers and a lack of control over flight supply". Panmure cut its target price down from 334p to 160p in the 
note. CA

The recovery in air travel across Europe has been a turbulent and two-speed affair, with the low-cost carriers 
leaving pandemic-related troubles in their wake while so-called flag carriers struggle to get back off the ground.
Intra-European travel, which was still around 30 per cent below pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of the year, 
closed last week just 13 per cent lower than in 2019, according to the European Organisation for the Safety of Air 
Navigation, known as Eurocontrol.
Low-cost, short-haul carriers are making the biggest gains. Ryanair (IE:RYA), Europe's biggest airline, is currently 
operating 8 per cent more flights than it did in 2019 - averaging 2,532 per day for the year to 29 August. Its capacity 
schedule for the third quarter is at 112 per cent of 2019 levels, according to BofA Securities.
Wizz Air (WIZZ) is continuing to grow its capacity - in part through a push into the Middle East through a joint 
venture with an Abu Dhabi government fund, ADQ. Its third -quarter capacity stands at 135 per cent of pre-
pandemic levels, and it has operated an average of 640 flights a day - an 11 per cent increase on 2019. Jet2 (JET2) 
is also operating 11 per cent more flights than it did pre-pandemic and the company said seat capacity for its 
summer season was 14 per cent higher than in 2019.
This bounceback compares even more favourably when set against the performance of former national airlines 
such as InterContinental Airlines Group's (IAG), British Airways, Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHA) and Air France 
(FR:AF). Flights operated by this trio are down by 34 per cent, 31 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, on 2019 
levels.

Ryanair has been a standout performer because it took the decision not to lay off staff during the pandemic - 
agreeing reduced pay deals for pilots and crew instead. They did so "at no insignificant cost to themselves" in 
anticipation of taking more market share, said John Strickland, owner of aviation consultancy JLS Consulting.
In general, the low-cost carriers' model, particularly their 'pointto-point' route operations, made it easier for them to 
scale up quickly as demand has rebounded, he added.
Things have been slower for the major legacy carriers in part because of the weaker long-haul market. European 
long-haul capacity is still only running at 73 per cent of 2019 levels, according to UBS.
Many of the inter-European flights operated by flag carriers are used to ferry passengers into their respective global 
hubs. But if fewer long-haul flights are taking off, they will operate fewer feeder flights.
The uncertainty surrounding the long-haul market, with restrictions on international travel only gradually being 
eased in China, made it difficult for flag carriers to assess demand levels for this year, Strickland said. "A lot of 
decisions to truly open things up didn't come until February or March, which, even in a normal year, is well past the 
planning timeframe for many airlines in terms of working out manpower, doing training, recruitment and so on," he 
added.
As of the end of June, IAG was carrying net debt of around (EURO)11bn (£9.5bn), Lufthansa (EURO)13bn and Air 
France/KLM had net debt of (EURO)6bn after completing a (EURO)2.26bn rights issue in June to pay back loans 
provided by the French state. All three continue to be lossmaking, but at substantially lower levels than were seen a 
year earlier.
Even airlines that have been able to operate at full capacity have faced constraints and one-off charges as a result 
of staffing problems at airports. Several of Europe's biggest airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Frankfurt and 
Amsterdam Schiphol, have limited the number of people transiting through them as they struggle to recruit enough 
staff after thousands of workers left the industry during pandemic-related periods of inactivity.
Capacity at the five major listed airport operators in Europe for September is still 16 per cent below pre-pandemic 
levels, according to data provider Cirium. Airline bosses have been scathing, with Ryanair's Michael O'Leary 
blaming disruption to its schedule on an "abysmal performance" by airport traffic control operators and airport 
staffing shortages.
Ryanair returned to profit in the three months to 30 June but told investors it could not give guidance for its full-year 
profit given the "fragile" nature of air travel and the prospect for new Covid variants.
Its low-cost competitors are still playing catch-up. EasyJet (EZJ) reported a £114mn loss for its June quarter, 
hampered by a £133mn charge as it was forced to cancel flights due to a "tight labour market" and the caps 
imposed at Gatwick and Amsterdam. The number of flights it operates are still more than a fifth below pre-pandemic 
levels, according to Eurocontrol data.
Gatwick Airport recently said it would remove its capacity cap after recruiting more than 400 new security staff but 
Heathrow and Amsterdam have both extended restrictions until the end of October.

Wizz Air (WIZZ) declared a quarterly loss of (EURO)453mn (£379mn) in the three months to June, despite 
quadrupling revenue to (EURO)809mn. It booked (EURO)65.5mn of "other costs" in the period, mainly relating to 
flight disruption and customer compensation payments.
In June, it was forced to reverse a costly decision taken two years ago to abandon fuel hedges. Its share price is 
down 45 per cent this year, compared with declines of 28 per cent at EASYJET (EZJ), 18 per cent at Ryanair 
(IE:RYA) and 14 per cent at Jet2 ( JET2).
Indeed, Wizz's current market cap of £2.36bn is only around £300mn more than Jet2's, despite having a fleet that is 
50 per cent larger.
Wizz chairman William Franke, whose private equity fund Indigo Partners owns stakes in several low-cost airlines, 
seems to think the sell-off has been overdone, buying £1.9mn-worth of shares on 22 July.
Not everyone agrees, though. HSBC analysts think the airline might face a liquidity squeeze this winter if it goes 
ahead with a ramp-up plan to grow capacity to 140 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, meaning it would need to either 
tap shareholders for more cash or risk its investment-grade status by borrowing more. MF

Athird successive summer of 'staycations', as domestic travel has been renamed, is upon us - much to airline 
operators' chagrin. Even as Covid-19 restrictions have become a thing of the past throughout Europe, the 
'airmageddon' unleashed by airports' languid approach to hiring staff have caused many to holiday closer to home 
in 2022.
This has created a headache for beleaguered airline operators, who have been forced to reduce capacity over their 
peak summer trading months. Last month, EASYJET's (EZJ) chief executive, Johan Lundgren, postponed air 
travel's return to normal until next summer, as he announced 10,000 flight cancellations. The shares have fallen by 
35 per cent over the last three months, with smaller falls of 14 per cent and 26 per cent at rivals Ryanair (RYA) and 
British Airways owner IAG (IAG), respectively.
Meanwhile, consumers are facing the largest squeeze on incomes in decades, with air travel seeing one of highest 
levels of price inflation in last month's consumer prices index. A survey by Retail Economics and Grant Thornton 
found that a third of UK households plan to decrease their spending on holidays, preferring to cut back by choosing 
cheaper foreign destinations and domestic travel. In all, Sykes Holiday Cottages' annual Staycation Index, 
published last week, estimated that 77 per cent of Brits are planning at least one staycation this year, and nearly 
half are spending their main summer break in the UK - which could pour an extra £15.5bn into the UK economy this 
summer. The company estimates the average spend on a domestic holiday is £822.
Summer 'airmageddon' to extend the staycation boom Elevated demand for UK outdoor activities and 
hospitality comes at a time when labour markets remain tight an....
This has given a boost to purveyors of gear for outdoor activities. Shares in JD Sports Fashion (JD.), which owns 
Go Outdoors, Blacks and Millets, have bucked the broader retail gloom, rising by a quarter over the last month as 
its outdoor chains swung back to a profit of £25.9mn in the year to January. JD Sports has credited "elevated 
demand for holidays in the UK" for its decision to open 11 more branches of its fishing, camping, and cycling shops 
this year.
Providers of UK holiday lets and hotel rooms are also celebrating. Sykes Holiday Cottages said it had seen a "surge 
in last-minute bookings", already up 30 per cent this year over 2021's pandemic-boosted levels. Chief executive 
Graham Donoghue expects elevated bookings will continue throughout the summer period and into autumn, saying 
travellers "simply don't want to have to tackle airports and take the risk that their family holidays could be 
cancelled".
In some cases, the value of the staycation trend has already been realised after two years of pandemic-disrupted 
holidays. Premier Inn owner Whitbread's (WTB) shares dramatically halved in late February 2020, but a year later 
they had recovered 90 per cent of their pre-pandemic value as staycations kept demand more resilient than 
expected.
Liberum analyst Anna Barnfather noted that the domestic travel boost was yielding uneven rewards geographically. 
Already, industry data from Coffer CGA Business Tracker shows that like-for-like sales in London bars, pubs, and 
restaurants are falling, down 1 per cent in June, compared with an increase of 7 per cent in hospitality 
establishments outside of the M25.
Brewer and pub landlord Shepherd Neame (SHEP) noted that same outlet like-for-like sales were up 13 per cent in 
the six weeks to 25 June, but most of this growth was concentrated in its coastal pubs and hotels.
Around a tenth of its premises are located in London, which are "still to see a full recovery but footfall is improving". 
According to Barnfather, slower growth in the capital reflects "rail strikes clearly adding to the already reduced 
worker footfall", adding that "more agile, healthy, value for money operators with exposure to more varied locations" 
will be best placed to harness an increased staycation spend.
Fuller, Smith & Turner's (FSTA) acquisition of Cotswold Inns & Hotels in October 2019 initially appeared poorly 
timed. But the seven country hotels this deal added was credited for Fullers' strong trading last summer. Again, this 
estate is expected to "help offset some of the London weakness" and drive total sales back above 2019 levels this 
year, according to Liberum.
Demand might be on the rise, but increasing capacity to satisfy a late surge is proving difficult. Much like airports, 
hotels and pubs dealt out lay-offs across their workforce during the pandemic, and many are now struggling to hire 
staff back. A recent survey of members by UKHOSPITALITY, the British Beer and Pub Association and the British 
Institute of Innkeeping found that one in seven jobs in the hospitality sector were vacant, with shortages causing 
businesses to lose 16 per cent of revenues on average.
Whitbread, which cut 1,500 jobs in 2020, said last month that a "tight" labour supply across the hospitality sector 
would contribute to £20mn-£30mn of additional costs in 2023. Likewise, pub chain JD Wetherspoon (JDW) issued a 
profit warning this month, expecting to make a £30mn loss this year thanks to labour costs becoming "far higher".
Success is mixed in the outdoor activities sector, too. Go Outdoors was only reacquired out of administration last 
June by JD Sports, having struggled with hefty lease obligations. Meanwhile, supply chain issues affecting bicycle 
components scuppered Halfords' (HFD) attempts to capture the cycling boom, with its bike sales actually declining 
by 27.2 per cent in the past year despite higher demand, and the shares halving year-to-date. The potential 
beneficiaries of the Great British staycation could continue to see demand exceeding capacity this summer.

Deep losses at Wizz Air (WIZZ) are expected to continue, with the budget airline predicting it will operate at a loss 
over the busy summer period. The shares fell by nearly 10 per cent at the midpoint of trading on results day, 
cementing a near-halving in the low-cost carrier's value in 2022.
Wizz Air has nearly tripled passenger numbers to 27.1mn in the year to 31 March, from 10.2mn in the previous 
year, and filled its planes at an improved load factor of 78.1 per cent. Chief executive József Váradi said he 
believes "we have now entered into an endemic phase of Covid-19 and have managed the trading impact from the 
war in Ukraine", but airlines are now being hampered by well-publicised staff shortages at airports.
Wizz Air, which operates out of London Gatwick and Luton, said it is "fully staffed" with pilots and cabin crew, and is 
using "buffer crews" in order to minimise flight cancellations. The budget airline's fortunes have diverged from rivals 
Ryanair (RYA) and EASYJET (EZJ) in 2022, after it was exposed to spiralling fuel prices in February due to 
management's no-hedge policy, having ceased dollar and jet fuel hedging in September 2020.
Wizz Air still trails behind peers at 15 per cent hedged for the year to March 2023. This could represent a significant 
problem over the medium term if fuel prices remain at elevated levels, while staffing disruptions and higher living 
costs create a volatile trading environment. The FactSet consensus for FY2023 sales stands at (EURO)3.22bn 
(£2.76bn). However, trading conditions remain challenging and a (EURO)362mn cash outflow is hardly encouraging 
given the debt overhang. Move to Hold. MT

Staff shortfalls have led to chaotic scenes at UK airports for more than a week, as operators struggle to deal with 
soaring demand for air travel. Along with spiking delays and cancellations over the half-term and Jubilee weekend 
period, there were reports of passengers stranded abroad, travellers climbing through baggage carousels to find 
luggage, and even of pilots forced to help load bags onto planes.
After laying off workers during the pandemic, airline operators are now attempting to plug the labour gap. British 
Airways, for example, slashed its workforce by around 10,000 people during Covid-19. Ground staff shortages are a 
particular problem across the industry.
Transport secretary Grant Shapps has rejected demands from the sector to relax EU immigration rules to ease the 
labour burden, and has attributed blame to the industry for a lack of post-pandemic preparation. He told the BBC 
"the answer can't always be to reach for the lever marked 'more immigration'".
But a Transport Committee report from the end of April said that the sector was not given adequate warning about 
the lifting of pandemic restrictions.
"It appears unfair for the government to blame the aviation industry for a lack of readiness, when the government 
failed to provide the notice and certainty requested by the industry," the committee said.

Airline share prices are behind the FTSE All-Share index over the past month, which is up 5 per cent, compared 
with 1-2 per cent falls among International Consolidated Airlines (IAG), EASYJET (EZJ) and Wizz Air (WIZZ). On a 
year-to-date basis, the airlines are much weaker than the All-Share index, hit by rising fuel costs and continued 
travel uncertainty.
British Airways, owned by IAG, told Investors' Chronicle that the cancellations being reported for the airline were 
planned and customers were informed well in advance.
"We're in the biggest recruitment drive in our history," a spokesperson said, and noted that the airline had cut its 
schedule by around 10 per cent until the end of October as it deals with labour shortfalls.
The chaos seen at airports comes against the backdrop of rocketing demand for air travel and muchimproved 
trading for operators, despite the difficulties with labour.
Wizz Air said in an update this week that it carried 4.12mn passengers in May, a 390 per cent increase on the same 
month last year. Ryanair (IE:RYA) revealed in its May traffic statistics report that it had 15.4mn passengers in the 
month, up sevenfold from 2021.
EasyJet's half-year report released last month said that it expected capacity to be at 90 per cent in the third quarter 
and 97 per cent in the fourth quarter against 2019. But the company also warned that "customers are booking 
closer to departure and visibility remains limited" on the outlook for short-term trading. But a loss of confidence in 
bookings could hurt upcoming demand.
It looks as though the disruption could continue for some time.
Eurocontrol, the European air traffic control agency, said this week that "the coming six-week period is likely to be 
extremely challenging for most airports, with very high demand putting strains on some of those airports' 
resources".
But Numis analysts are more sanguine. They said the number of overall cancellations at UK airports was relatively 
small and with government intervention anticipated, the disruptions should be "short-lived and largely resolved by 
summer".

Demand for holidays abroad has come roaring back. This was apparent over Easter, when EASYJET (EZJ) and 
British Airways cancelled hundreds of flights because they could not find enough staff, and holidaymakers waited in 
long queues at the airports. EasyJet said it flew almost six times as many passengers - 23.4mn in total - in the six 
months to 31 March, with more flights and a fuller capacity compared with last year.
Leisure and domestic routes have fully recovered, with summer capacity set to exceed 2019 levels at 113 per cent 
and 104 per cent, respectively, while demand for business and city traffic still lags behind pre-pandemic levels. This 
recovery has driven up revenue per available seat by 33 per cent to £49, with flight loads having improved to 77.3 
per cent full, up from 63.7 per cent the year before.
Like its rival Ryanair (IE:RYA), EASYJET did not offer guidance for the next year, saying that the short-term outlook 
is uncertain since "customers are booking closer to departure and visibility remains limited". EasyJet is already 76 
per cent booked up for the third quarter beginning in June, but this falls to 36 per cent sold from September 
onwards.
EasyJet plans to tackle the staff shortage issue by offering new and existing cabin crew a £1,000 bonus at the end 
of the summer holiday season, in order to boost hiring and retention.
Liberum reiterated a target price of 800p for the airline's shares, noting EASYJET's "clear optimism" on load factors 
and yields. Meanwhile, there are "positive pricing trends versus 2019 mitigating cost headwinds", including rising 
fuel prices. Still, the travel industry has charted one of the most difficult journeys out of the pandemic, and with 
consumer spending now set for a fall, the future remains far from clear. Hold.

S
implistic as it might seem, investment style considerations explain plenty of the shifts in investor portfolios in the 
past year or so. Cyclical shares have had a resurgence, led by some big moves in energy and financials, while 
quality growth portfolios have seen some big peaks and troughs. Quality growth shares have run into trouble this 
year in particular, bar a very recent recovery.
In such circumstances, it's hard to argue against the case for diversification by style, sector and geography. When it 
comes to the first of these, investors can pair the few remaining value funds with more growth-oriented names (see 
'Funds to hold alongside Fundsmith Equity and Scottish Mortgage', IC, 29 October 2021) in the hope that the two 
balance each other out. This, however, might seem like a complicated and expensive way to achieve such balance.
Another option is to back a fund with more of a generalist, style-neutral approach to offset market rotations. These 
are rare beasts, but a handful of names stand out.
Picking a lane Active fund managers have had good reason to lean heavily into a particular style in recent years. 
Greater scrutiny of so-called closet trackers - funds that charge a level of fees typical of active funds but deviate 
only marginally from a benchmark - is likely to have forced managers to display more conviction. The conditions of 
the past decade have also led many funds to bet heavily on growth stocks, while the few remaining value funds 
have in many cases built a reputation by sticking to their guns.
Styleneutral funds for market rotations Style-neutral funds can be a good way to offset market rotations. Dave 
Baxter reports
Even some investment teams that make a point of diversifying can fall into a certain camp. Take Monks Investment 
Trust (MNKS). Although this Baillie Giffordrun fund dips into more cyclical areas thanks to a focus on different 
investment categories, its managers have still been pretty growthminded in recent history. Some 52 per cent of its 
portfolio was in "rapid growth" plays such as Sea (US:SE), Tesla (US:TSLA) and Baillie Gifford's Schiehallion Fund 
(MNTN) at the end of October, and "growth stalwarts" such as Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and Microsoft (US:MSFT) 
made up 26.7 per cent of its assets. Cyclical growth plays represented 15.5 per cent of the portfolio, while "latent 
growth" holdings including Ryanair (IE:RYA) made up 5.8 per cent.
Yet a few "neutral" portfolios remain. Global options include MI Metropolis Valuefund (GB00B3LDLX86), which 
despite the name mixes both growth and value characteristics, says Rob Morgan, chief analyst at Charles Stanley. 
Its latest annual report points to something of a mix in late 2021. The fund had a 30.1 per cent allocation to 
technology shares including Alphabet, Mastercard (US:MA), Oracle (US:ORCL) and Cisco Systems (US:CSCO) at 
the end of September, but some classic value sectors also get a look in. Take the fund's 21.7 per cent weighting to 
financials, for example. It is very concentrated, with between 15 and 25 holdings, and has a high level of active 
share (the extent to which it differs from its benchmark). Morgan notes that while it has lagged the market in recent 
years, the underperformance seems relatively modest when its balanced approach is taken into consideration.
John Monaghan, research director at Square Mile Investment Consulting and Research, highlights Artemis Global 
Select (GB00B568S201). "The managers are focused on uncovering quality businesses that are supported by 
established growth trends, and the resulting portfolio is less exposed to the vagaries of the prevailing economic 
climate," he says. "The process is dynamic, with new themes continually being explored, tested and occasionally 
included in the portfolio while those considered to have played out are reduced or removed. Broadly speaking, we 
would expect this fund to lag in aggressively rising markets, particularly when the market is being led by pro-cyclical 
industries or when it appears to have overextended itself. However, the strategy should hold up better than the 
index and peers during market sell-offs."
The UK and other regions Investors haven't been hard-pushed to find examples of style divergence in the UK, with 
growth funds such as Liontrust Special Situations (GB00BG0J2688) and CFP SDL UK Buffettology 
(GB00BF0LDZ31) seemingly on the other side of the fence to a variety of value stalwarts. But some managers still 
seek a middle ground.
Mick Gilligan highlights Edinburgh Investment Trust (EDIN), a UK equity income fund run by James de Uphaugh 
and Chris Field at Majedie Asset Management, a firm recently bought by Liontrust. And Monaghan likes the recently 
renamed LF Liontrust UK Equity Fund (GB00B88NK732) run by the same team.
Edinburgh Investment Trust's literature states that its management team avoids style biases and instead seeks 
different opportunities across the market. As Gilligan notes, the team likes companies that have scope for share 
price recovery via a change of management, organisational transformation or an improving business environment. 
"Approximately three-quarters of the managers' effort is in-depth stock research, while the remainder is in 
macroeconomic and geopolitical analysis," he says.
Morgan, meanwhile, says: "In the UK the obvious one that springs to mind is Richard Buxton's Jupiter UK Alpha 
(GB00BFYN3R70), which isn't a particularly style-driven fund [and blends] elements of growth, value and special 
situations. The pragmatic nature means allocation to these broad buckets does change a bit over time, though."
Other markets We have deliberately focused on fund sectors to which you might have bigger allocations, but there 
are sector-neutral funds focused on other markets. To note a few, Morgan points to quant-driven Jupiter Merian 
North American Equity Fund (GB00B1XG9G04) as a play on the US, adding that quant-led portfolios are generally 
more likely to straddle different styles. He also highlights "pragmatic" funds that can move in and out of other areas 
such as Artemis US Extended Alpha (GB00BMMV5G59) and Premier Miton US Opportunities (GB00B8278F56), a 
fund we have previously highlighted as looking down the market cap spectrum and away from the mega-cap tech 
stocks ('Looking beyond the Faangs', IC, 25 September 2020). Turning to emerging markets, Morgan highlights 
Styleneutral funds for market rotations Style-neutral funds can be a good way to offset market rotations. Dave 
Baxter reports
Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust (TEM), noting: "Having been firmly value in the past, it now sits in 
the middle as a core proposition".
Over the longer term, you might view passive funds as one route to a balanced portfolio as they offer such broad 
market exposure and slowly rebalance to reflect companies' changing fortunes.
But this comes with some heavy caveats given how lopsided they have become. For example, the S&P 500 and 
MSCI World indices are heavily exposed to the US tech majors, emerging market and Asian indices are highly 
exposed to China, and the FTSE 100 has some big cyclical exposures.

Ryanair IE:RYA (EURO)1,366 AIRLINES • Hedged fuel costs • Aggressive expansion • Growth not priced in • 
Airlines' poor track record • UK de-listing
L
egendary investor Warren Buffett once joked about having a freephone number he could call so that if he ever got 
the urge to buy an airline share they could talk him out of it. Airlines had "eaten up capital over the past century like 
almost no other business", he told The Telegraph in a 2002 interview.
Since then, airlines have continued to hobble investor returns. The Covid-19 pandemic caused the biggest demand 
shock the industry has ever experienced, with cumulative industry losses expected to top $201bn (£154bn) by the 
end of this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Airlines' combined debt burden has 
already increased by more than $200bn to $650bn.
The problems Buffett identifies - big fixed costs, an organised workforce capable of leveraging its power, and violent 
fuel price swings - make finding profitable investments in the sector difficult, but not impossible.
And as travel picks up as the world learns to live with the pandemic, there will be airlines that emerge stronger. In 
Europe, Ryanair (IE:RYA) seems better equipped than the rest.
Ryanair clear for take-off Airlines will always be a risky investor proposition. But Ryanair has emerged from the 
pandemic in front. Michael Fahy reports
As anyone who's travelled with the Dublinbased carrier is made aware through its in-flight announcements, it is 
Europe's number one airline, in passenger terms. It carried almost 150mn passengers in the year to March 2020.
Such scale brings benefits when ordering planes, negotiating pay deals, haggling with airports over landing fees, 
haranguing
governments for tax breaks or securing bulk fuel supplies.
Ryanair also has an unrelenting focus on costs to keep ticket prices low - the company even floated the idea at one 
stage of charging passengers to use plane toilets.
It might not have been entirely serious about this - chief executive Michael O'Leary, an accountant by trade but a 
born marketeer - often floats ideas such as selling lower-priced standing-only tickets that he knows are unworkable 
but will win the airline free publicity.
When pitching to investors, the company frequently trumpets its lead over competitors in terms of costs. Prior to the 
pandemic, the airline's costs per passenger (excluding fuel) were (EURO)31 (£26.11). This is 26 per cent lower 
than the (EURO)38 incurred by its nearest competitor, Hungary-based Wizz Air (WIZZ). Easyjet's (EZJ) ex-fuel 
costs per passenger were (EURO)56, while Lufthansa's (DE:LHA) Eurowings' was (EURO)94.
This can make flying with Ryanair a pretty brutal experience when things go wrong. Low overheads mean a lack of 
support and a seemingly indifferent attitude towards customers when flights are delayed or cancelled. Over a 
decade ago, O'Leary summed up the company's approach in an interview by saying "We don't want to hear your 
sob stories. What part of 'no refund' don't you understand?"
The company has reined in some of its more egregious practices, such as charging an administration fee to every 
customer who didn't use an obscure form of debit card, but its sharp-elbowed reputation remains.
More customers than fans According to YouGov, Ryanair is the most poorly perceived airline in the UK. Its 
impression score - which weighs positive customer sentiment against negative - was minus 33.5 per cent for the 12 
months to March, the lowest of any brand tracked by the pollster.
"Ryanair also has the distinction of being the airline the public would be most embarrassed to work for," it added.
Yet the metric that O'Leary would be most interested in - whether a customer would
consider rebooking with the same brand - was a positive 19.5, putting it fifth out of 27 airlines tracked by YouGov.
Ryanair clearly has faith that they will. Although IATA only expects international travel to remain at 69 per cent of 
2019 levels this year, and for a full recovery of air traffic to take until 2025, Ryanair is putting on 114 per cent of its 
2019 capacity this summer and is launching 720 new routes, as well as opening 15 new bases.
Although it can't claim to have had a good crisis - it lost (EURO)1.1bn in the year ending March 2021, as revenue 
and passenger numbers fell by 81 per cent - it certainly hasn't wasted it.
Ryanair entered the pandemic with its costs per passenger creeping up as staff unionised and it started losing pilots 
to fast-growing competitors such as Norwegian, which was attempting to emulate Ryanair's low-fare models on 
long-haul transatlantic routes, but later retrenched after falling into administration.
Delays in the delivery from Boeing of new 737 Max planes - exacerbated when they were involved in two fatal 
crashes - also meant maintenance costs rose.
Ryanair renegotiated staffpay deals, securing pay cuts of up to 20 per cent over three to five years as an alternative 
to redundancies. It also struck long-term agreements with some of its main airport hubs, including London Stansted, 
Manchester, Charleroi and Bergamo.
Ryanair clear for take-off Airlines will always be a risky investor proposition. But Ryanair has emerged from the 
pandemic in front. Michael Fahy reports
On top of this, as Boeing was enveloped in a crisis that grounded all of its 737 Max planes for almost two years, 
Ryanair struck a deal to add another 75 planes to its existing order, bringing the total to 210 - enough to cover its 
growth ambitions until 2028. The terms of the deal were not disclosed and in an unusual moment of diplomacy, 
O'Leary only went as far as saying it had secured a "modest discount" on Boeing's list price. He has been less 
graceful since subsequent negotiations for more planes broke offin September last year.
"It's one thing not attracting new customers but to lose your existing customers to your direct competitor, Airbus, 
seems to me to be a failure of your salesforce," he said of the US planemaker on an earnings call in January.
Ready for take-offThe airline is targeting a 50 per cent expansion in passenger numbers to 225mn by March 2026. 
O'Leary said that legacy airlines and some "inferior low-cost carriers" won't be able to operate at pre-pandemic 
capacity and it intends to move into the void.
In a pre-close trading update this week, Ryanair said it had cut net debt to (EURO)1.5bn - or just two-thirds of 
HSBC's forecast cash profit for the next 12 months. Average industry net debt stands at 3.9 times earnings, 
according to BofA Securities.
For the year just ended, Ryanair said it expects a net loss of between (EURO)350mn and (EURO)400mn. 
Passenger numbers recovered to 97mn - more than three times the 27.5mn carried last year, but still only 65 per 
cent of pre-pandemic levels.
Numbers are picking up fast after a blip over Christmas, when the Omicron wave of the coronavirus spread. March 
traffic rose to 11.2mn, from 8.7mn in February. Its load factor - the number of bums on plane seats - nudged up to 
87 per cent, and would have been higher had the airline not suffered disruptions following Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine.
Ukraine represented about 1 per cent of Ryanair's business, but the airline didn't have any aircraft based in the 
country, according to Stephen Furlong, an analyst at stockbroker Davy. Planes have been redeployed on other 
routes serving Italy, Greece and Spain. The airline said it is committed to restoring flights to Ukraine as soon as it is 
safe.
The nearer-term outlook is positive. Furlong expects Ryanair's load factors to move back north of 90 per cent from 
this month onwards. Barring any new capital expenditure arising from plane deals, finance chief Neil Sorahan said 
the focus for the next two years is to get back to a net cash position.
Price war possible Berenberg analysts, by contrast, expect Ryanair "to prioritise passengers over yields" and 
potentially undercut Wizz in markets where both airlines operate. Wizz is scheduled to compete with 27 per cent of 
Ryanair's capacity in the summer.
Given the current level of energy prices, fuel costs could prove to be a big advantage for the Irish carrier. Wizz 
abandoned its hedging policy last year but Ryanair has hedged 80 per cent of its fuel costs until March 2023.
O'Leary told investors on its last earnings call that its "cost leadership has significantly widened over other airlines 
in Europe".
After long delays, Ryanair expects to take delivery of 65 of the new Boeing aircraft it has on order by the summer. 
These have 4 per cent more seats than existing models but need 16 per cent less fuel. A newer fleet should also 
lower maintenance costs.
Furlong said other initiatives, such as
setting up its own simulators to train pilots, mean that on a like-for-like basis, expenses are likely to be lower than 
they were as the company entered into the pandemic.
"Of any airline, its cost base is the lowest and it's going lower," he said.
Ryanair clear for take-off Airlines will always be a risky investor proposition. But Ryanair has emerged from the 
pandemic in front. Michael Fahy reports
The operational leverage benefits from keeping costs down as revenues grow offer an investment opportunity, 
particularly at the airline's current valuation. Its shares are trading hands at 12 times FactSet compiled consensus 
earnings forecasts for the current financial year, which is lower than its peer group. Its PEG ratio - a quick and dirty 
calculation to weigh up a company's share price against the growth on offer - is just 0.2, and far below the level at 
which the shares are deemed fairly priced.
The only fly in the ointment for UK investors is the airline's delisting from the London Stock Exchange last year - a 
symptom of the Brexit vote, as under EU rules the airline needs to ensure the majority of its shareholders are from 
the bloc.
Although "the long-term investment case remains the same" for Ryanair, UK shareholders have lost their voting 
rights and can't buy new shares on the London market, analyst Sophie Lund-Yates of Hargreaves Lansdown noted.
They can, of course, buy American Depository Receipts (which also lack voting rights) or shares on the Dublin 
bourse, but the latter will have particular tax implications for some investors and may also incur higher dealing 
costs.

Is there money to be made from a Purplebricks (PURP) rebuild? Calling the bottom on a company that has 
continually disappointed, losing more than 90 per cent of its value since 2018, would certainly be brave.
The online estate agency has struggled to get its house in order, having abandoned an international extension and 
falling into a legal dispute with "contractors". So even as the housing market has boomed, it has not.
Half-year results for the six months to October showed a pre-tax loss of £12.9mn on revenue of £41.3mn, partly 
because it has had to recognise sales agents it previously deemed to be self-employed as employees. It also 
secured fewer instructions, with its market share declining to 3.9 per cent, from 4.8 per cent a year earlier.
The loss of faith in Purplebricks means its market capitalisation slipped to £74mn by 18 March, which isn't a great 
deal higher than the £58.3mn of cash it held on its balance sheet at the half-year stage.
A new chief financial officer, Steve Long, was appointed in February and chief executive Vic Darvey's departure 
was announced earlier this month. Chief operating officer Helena Marston is stepping up to replace him.
Given the housing market is showing continued strength - average annual house price growth rose to 12.6 per cent 
in February, according to building society Nationwide - there are clearly some who think there's money to be made 
in Purplebricks' restoration.
JNE Partners disclosed on 9 March it had increased its stake in the company from 7 per cent to nearer 11 per cent.
The London-based investor, a spin-out from a vehicle set up to manage Dell Technologies (US:DELL) founder 
Michael Dell's wealth, focuses on buying shares and bonds trading at "substantial discounts to intrinsic value", 
according to its website.
Is Purplebricks a 'doer-upper'?
It is now Purplebricks' second-biggest shareholder behind German media giant Axel Springer, which holds 26.5 per 
cent. Directors are also showing their faith. Non-executives Simon Downing and Elona Mortimer-Zhika, and the wife 
of chairman Paul Pindar, spent more than £330,000 on shares between 11 and 15 March, filings show. The latter 
pair topped up holdings earlier this week. MF
Directors buying as Ryanair does more flying As anyone who has been a passenger on a Ryanair (IE:RYA) flight 
knows, the Dublinbased airline is not shy about trumpeting its "industry-leading" safety record.
Shareholders have endured more of a buffetting, though. Ryanair's beta of 1.18 indicates that share price swings 
have been more volatile than the broader market over the past 12 months. This is understandable given the many 
travel restrictions and the knocks to confidence caused by the spread of new coronavirus variants. There's also 
been the matter of its post-Brexit delisting from the London Stock Exchange to deal with.
The airline, however, remains as bullish as its chief executive, Michael O'Leary. Two non-executives - Roisin 
Brennan and Geoff Doherty - have bought about (EURO)56,000 and (EURO)499,000-worth of shares, respectively.
They are not alone. According to FactSet, the consensus target price among analysts for Ryanair shares is 
(EURO)19.46, a 44 per cent uplift on the current trading price of (EURO)13.5. MF

Are recovery prospects for the tourism sector already apparent in valuations? Is it time to pack the factor 30 and 
castanets? There has been no shortage of punditry over the state of the tourism industry, specifically whether 2022 
will mark something of a renaissance, at least in terms of flying hours and passenger numbers.
The portents are encouraging. Recent quarterly updates from both Ryanair (US:RYAAY) and EASYJET (EZJ) point 
to rising load factors (utilised seating capacity), along with positive noises on the UK government decision to 
remove all travel testing requirements. The latter carrier's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, anticipates "a strong 
summer ahead, with pent-up demand that will see EASYJET returning to near-2019 levels of capacity with UK 
beach and leisure routes performing particularly well". Shares prices for the budget airlines have moved in different 
directions over the past six months, with a gain of 2.3 per cent on Nasdaq for Ryanair set against an 11.5 per cent 
decline in London for EASYJET.
Valuations for both companies pulled back sharply as soon as it became clear that vaccination programmes had 
done little to stem the infection rates and transmissibility associated with the Omicron variant.
Subsequently, however, clinicians have posited that the global spread of Omicron and its initial high effective 
reproduction number - the so-called 'Rt' number - may have less to do with its inherent evasiveness than the 
enhanced ability of people's immune systems to suppress competing variants. If that's the case, then the spread of 
Omicron may signal that we may shortly be able to designate SARS-CoV-2 as 'endemic', as the Danes already 
have. At any rate, the clinical situation is certainly looking much brighter than it did at the beginning of December.
Beyond the impact of the virus, the differing share price trajectories of the two airlines could be partly linked to their 
fuel hedging arrangements. EASYJET is currently c60 per cent hedged for fuel in the financial year ending on 30 
COMPANIES
September 2022, while Ryanair is almost fully hedged for the fourth quarter of FY2022 and 80 per cent hedged for 
the first half of FY2023.
The IATA Jet Fuel Price Monitor shows that the price of aviation fuel has increased by 77.8 per cent over the past 
12 months, representing an index value of 289 against a base figure of 100 for the year 2000. Crude prices recently 
hit a seven-year high, and the global supplyside continues to tighten while the extent of inventory drawdowns 
suggests that the airlines may have to cope with elevated prices for an extended period.
The good news is that passengers are unlikely to be overly worried if the airlines - and the wider tourism industry - 
keep discounts to a minimum over the next couple of years. It's a seller's market and various studies have already 
shown that demand for tourism products is generally price-inelastic.
The initial anxiety over the Omicron variant and continued worries over the cost of aviation fuel are also reflected in 
recent valuations for contracts such as the iShares STOXX Europe 600 Travel & Leisure UCITS ETF (FRA:EXV9) 
and US Global Jets ETF (US:JETS). Both these derivatives saw their valuations halve in less than a month from 
midway through February 2020, once it became obvious that travel and tourism were to become early casualties of 
the virus. A steady retracement duly followed, but the issues we have highlighted reversed some of the earlier 
gains. Consequently, the respective values for the contracts are now 15 and 31 per cent adrift of where they were 
prior to the pandemic.
By contrast, Ryanair has more than made up for the initial sell-off and now trades 3 per cent in advance of its 200-
day moving average. Other industry players such as InterContinental Hotels (IHG) and Expedia (US:EXPE) have 
also fared remarkably well, suggesting that broad-based exposure may be the way forward.
Nonetheless, with long-term growth projections on tourist numbers easily outstripping growth rates for nearly every 
major economy, some stockpickers might be tempted by Airbnb (US: ABNB), particularly given the platform's 
seemingly limitless addressable market. Again, the shares pulled back from mid-November, but they are still up on 
their public debut price in December 2020. Its capital-light business model has been very much in vogue over the 
past few years, while a price/ cash-flow multiple of 62 times is roughly half that of its historical average rate 
compiled by FactSet. Still, that's probably a little rich given the rotation out of growth stocks under way; an effective 
reassessment of tech multiples. Plus there's the sneaking suspicion that the recovery in travel numbers is already 
baked into industry valuations.
AIRLINES MAY HAVE TO COPE WITH ELEVATED FUEL PRICES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD

Ryanair sees December slowdown

After seeing flights filling up in recent months, Ryanair (Ire:RYA) has reported a drop-off in both passenger numbers 
and load factor for December. The usually busy month for travel saw a 7 per cent fall in passengers compared with 
November, at 9.5m. Load factor, or the percentage of seats sold, fell to 81 per cent from 86 per cent. Before a drop-
off in bookings caused by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, the airline had expected 10m-11m passengers in 
December.
In reaction to this slowdown, Ryanair expects its net loss for the 12 months ended 31 March to be (EURO)250m-
(EURO)450m (£209m-£378m), well above the previous guidance range of (EURO)100m to (EURO)200m. January 
is also likely to be tough. In the days before Christmas, the budget airline announced that its bookings had tumbled 
and that it would cut the number of flights in January by a third.
London-listed travel companies are trading more strongly than a month ago, however, when the Omicron variant 
was just emerging as a major risk for the industry. British Airways owner IAG (IAG) and EASYJET (EZJ) are both 
up 20 per cent since the first week of December, as is airport catering specialist SSP (SSPG). AH

As travel slowly returns, airline share prices have bounced around, with optimism and Covid-19 case rates 
swapping focus each week. The most recent dip came as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria raised the alarm 
over rising Covid cases, with lockdowns of varying degrees put in place.
This worsened outlook and the greater prospect of the pandemic determining another winter's travel options hit 
airlines hard, with the majors such as British Airways-owner IAG (IAG) down about 10 per cent since the first week 
of November.
Aim-traded Jet2 ( JET2) has a slightly different focus to the other London-listed carriers bar Tui (TUI), given the 
lion's share of its business comes from package holiday sales. As of 18 November, its outlook for the coming 
months was positive, with seat capacity only down 11 per cent compared with the 2019-20 winter period. This 
update also included a widened interim operating loss as customer demand did not meet expectations. The airline's 
load factor, effectively how many seats are filled, fell from 69 per cent in the first half of last year to 57 per cent this 
year because restrictions kept more wary travellers on the ground.
Right after the half-year results announcement, executive chair Philip Meeson sold £22m in shares, as well as 
another £5m from an entity called The Philip Meeson 2019 Settlement, of which he is a trustee but not a 
beneficiary. A spokesperson for the company said the sale was consistent with his "historic sales of small amounts 
of his holding from time to time". Meeson, who bought what turned into Jet2 in 1983, still owns 20.18 per cent of the 
company.
Like Ryanair (RYA), Jet2 has used the forecast demand in travel for 2022 to pitch itself as a Covid-19 recovery 
story. While it's hard to imagine 2020-level restrictions coming back, the past week has shown it's not completely off 
the table. Hold.

Travelling by air recently has meant turning up to the airport with two passports: one being the identity document 
and the other confirming whether you've been vaccinated against Covid-19. This is a problem for central and 
Eastern Europe-focused budget airline Wizz Air (WIZZ), as rates of vaccination in its key markets are lower than 
elsewhere in Europe.
Wizz boss József Váradi said there was hope of a rapid turnaround in the coming months, citing a forecast that 
Romania would go from 30 per cent of the population being fully vaccinated against Covid-19 currently to 75 per 
cent in February.
In its latest results, covering the six months to 30 September, Wizz reported a similar set of numbers to fellow 
budget airline Ryanair (RYA): improvements on last year, but not a return to pre-pandemic performance yet. The 
company did make it back to a cash profit position of (EURO)164m (£140m), compared with an (EURO)81m cash 
loss last year, however. Like Ryanair, Wizz has decided to expand to secure market share from shuttered 
competitors. It took delivery of 13 new aircraft in the six-month period, taking its fleet to 144 planes, compared with 
132 at the end of the first half in 2020.
The growth won't help much in the current financial year, however. Wizz said it would have an operating loss of 
around (EURO)200m in the current quarter, compared with broker Davy Research's forecast of a (EURO)35m loss.
Basing an investment case on Romanian vaccination rates is not a great starting point, but we think it is in a good 
position for the travel rebound next year. Move to buy.

Ryanair RYA 1,710¢ TRAVEL & LEISURE • Ryanair outlines expansion to take more market share in budget space 
• London listing could go because of restrictions on airline ownership post-Brexit
Just as Ryanair (RYA) says it is readying for take-off following the broader relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions, UK 
investors could be grounded as it reconsiders its secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange. The company 
had already stripped UK investors of voting rights, but a delisting indicates Ryanair is not confident a deal will be 
reached between the EU and UK to alter airline ownership rules.
Ryanair said there had been a "migration" away from trading in London post-Brexit, made "more acute for Ryanair 
as a result of the long-standing prohibition on non-EU citizens purchasing Ryanair's ordinary shares being extended 
to UK nationals following Brexit".
At the same time, Ryanair outlined an ambitious growth strategy to profit from the smaller field of competitors it now 
faces, following the collapse of other Europe-focused budget airlines such as Germanwings and Norwegian. This 
saw capital spending triple in the first half to (EURO)311m (£264m). Ryanair also upped its passenger growth 
forecast for the next five years from a third to a half, meaning it wants to have 225m passengers in 2026.
The picture was not so rosy this summer, however. The airlines have had to manage pandemic uncertainty despite 
the high vaccination rates and loosening of government rules. Ryanair's number of passengers for the first half was 
39m, more than double last year, but this was still well below the 2019 figure of 86m.
Ryanair taking off from London; The budget airline says lack of update to EU ownership rules means it could 
leave the London Stock Exchange just as its Covid-19....
Given the second half includes the slower winter season - and potential for new travel restrictions, especially in 
theUK - Ryanair has said its 2022 financial year could bring a pre-tax loss of between (EURO)100m and 
(EURO)200m.
The company has hedged 80 per cent of its fuel requirements for the March quarter, the last of its financial year, to 
balance out higher costs. Carbon credit costs are fully hedged for the 2022 financial year at (EURO)24 per EU 
allowance (EUA), compared with the current price of around (EURO)60/EUA. This is the right to emit one tonne of 
carbon dioxide equivalent. The company also took in (EURO)42m in government assistance from various support 
schemes in the half.
Despite these protections, the airline said the outlook for "pricing and yields" for winter would be challenging. Davy 
Research analyst Stephen Furlong said the company was prioritising long-term growth over short-term profits, 
although he said Ryanair had a "pristine" balance sheet. The company ran a (EURO)1.2bn bond issue in May and 
repaid a £600m loan earlier than needed at the end of October.
Furlong predicts an operating loss again in 2022, but then sees a quick recovery for this metric in 2023, to 
(EURO)1.6bn, well ahead of 2019.
A buy/sell/hold call for Ryanair is largely academic given its availability to UK investors solely through ADRs on the 
Nasdaq exchange, but in a characteristically bullish manner it is ready for a more open world. This would be a solid 
bet on the travel world coming back.

It's certainly a buyers' market for passenger planes right now. Norwegian Air (NOR:NAS) chief executive Geir 
Karlsen said the budget airline had taken out more than two-thirds of its fleet and cancelled orders for 185 aircraft 
as it continues to restructure a business that was forced into bankruptcy last year.
Norwegian has exited the long-haul business and reduced headcount by more than 6,000 as part of an overhaul 
that has seen it cut about 140bn Norwegian krone (£11.7bn) of debt, liabilities and other commitments. It now has 
just 51 short-haul aircraft, 32 of which were in use in the first half of the year. Revenue for the first six months of 
2021 fell 92 per cent to NKr590.8m as passenger numbers dropped by 89 per cent to 590,000.
Meanwhile, UK budget airline Jet2 (JET2) agreed a deal to buy 36 new Airbus A321 neo aircraft at "significant 
discounts" to the official list price of $4.9bn. It also has an option to extend the order to 60 planes, at a list price of 
$8.1bn. The narrowbody planes will be used to grow its leisure travel business and refresh its existing fleet, the 
company said. Delivery will be staggered over five years until the end of 2028.
Trading figures from both aviation services specialist Menzies (MNZS) and retailer WH Smith (SMWH) also both 
suggested some light at the end of a very long tunnel for the industry. Following on from Ryanair's (RYA) update 
indicating it expects passenger numbers to pick up in the autumn, Menzies said that it had returned to profit in the 
first half of this year and that demand for its services, which include cargo handling and refueling, was showing 
signs of a sustained pick-up. That said, management added the caveat that it expects it to take until 2023 for 
demand to return to pre-pandemic levels. Menzies has cut its cloth accordingly over the past year, reflected in a fall 
in turnover in the first half but an underlying profit of £10.9m against a loss of £48.7m in 2020.
Meanwhile, WH Smith has guided that full-year performance may slightly exceed expectations after a recovery in 
activity at its shops both on the high street and in travel locations - previously the main driver of growth pre-
pandemic. MF

Wizz Air sets a price target No Free Lunch A pay policy gets through because UK shares were disenfranchised.
Wizz Air sets a price target; No Free Lunch A pay policy gets through

If evidence was needed that UK fund managers expect more stringent checks and balances on company directors 
than those from other countries, investors in Wizz Air (WIZZ) have recently provided it. At its annual general 
meeting (AGM) on 27 July, they voted through a controversial pay policy that could pay its chief executive, Jozsef 
Varadi, £100m in 2026.
The directors were anxious to retain Varadi, who founded the Hungarian low-fare airline in 2003, and whose 
contract had almost expired. He had spearheaded a strategy that, they said, had increased Wizz Air's share price 
since its initial public offering in 2015 by more than three times that of Ryanair (RYA), whereas easyJet (EZJ) and 
IAG (IAG) had lost shareholder value over the same period. They said the proposed pay policy was "critical" for 
encouraging him to sign a new fiveyear contract and that it would commit the top team and employees to delivering 
more shareholder value by giving them a slice of the pie.
Against this, the proposed policy failed to comply with best practice. Originally, instead of having a single long-term 
share plan for all executives, the committee had tailored one just for the chief executive. After some pushback from 
shareholders, the top 11 executives were included in a similar plan and the share price targets increased. Some 90 
per cent of the awards depends on the share price, 5 per cent on reducing carbon emissions and 5 per cent on 
finding more women to fill senior management roles. For employees, a cash bonus plan is to be introduced, linked 
to the growth in shareholder value.
Share price targets The promise now is that if the share price rises by an average of a tenth every year for the next 
five years, Varadi will receive £20m-worth of Wizz Air shares. So, at the closing price on the day of the AGM of 
£46.59, that means a price of £75 in July 2026. If he can double that compound annual growth to 20 per cent, 
Wizz Air sets a price target No Free Lunch A pay policy gets through because UK shares were disenfranchised.
suggesting a target price of £116, his payout will be capped at £100m of shares. He will be able to sell two-fifths of 
these in 2026, followed by a fifth in each of the next three years. This won't cost anything in cash because in 2026 
the directors will create the shares due to the top team. But there will be a hit to profits of about (EURO)10.5m 
(£8.96m) a year and at most the extra shares will dilute the share price by about 2 per cent.
Ahead of the AGM, held by proxy in Geneva, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis had advised 
shareholders to reject the policy. The UK-based Investment Association, whose members collectively own a third of 
the shares quoted in London, also flagged substantial concerns. This was a one-off award for five years, while 
smaller annual awards are preferred. The payout relies too much on the share price, which is subject to factors 
beyond the company's control; and most tellingly the scale of the award is out of all proportion to his salary of 
(EURO)664,050. This compares with the average median pay of Wizz Air's employees of (EURO)31,587 a year. 
Even the minimum payout would be worth more to Varadi than the (EURO)17m he has received in total over the 
past 10 years. Yet despite the concerns of UK-based institutional investors, the directors were quietly confident of 
getting the policy through.
The vote There was a good reason for this. For years, the European Union, like the US and Japan, has limited 
foreign nationals' ownership of its airlines. In the EU's case, its airlines have to be majority-controlled by EEA 
nationals (those from EU countries, plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Since about 60 per cent 
of Wizz Air's shares were owned by UK investors and Brexit Britain refused to join the EEA, Wizz Air had to remove 
the voting rights of about half of those shares. Similar measures were taken by easyJet. Meanwhile, Ryanair said it 
would simply ban the British from showing up to, speaking at, or voting at its shareholder meetings.
At Wizz Air's AGM, a third of the 16m votes cast were against the new pay policy. Two-thirds supported it. But this 
was out of a total of 103m shares in issue - a turnout of 16 per cent. Those UK votes sacrificed to Brexit might have 
made the difference.
But there's another way of looking at this. Varadi is 55 years old and perfectly capable of taking on new challenges. 
He could move on to a competitor or set up a rival airline. And if the share price reaches the threshold of £75, Wizz 
Air's market value will have increased by more than £2.5bn, against which the £20m due to him would seem small 
change. Some evidently took the view that you have to be pragmatic about these things.
60% 60 PER CENT OF WIZZ AIR'S SHARES WERE OWNED BY UK INVESTORS

Ryanair (RYA) might have unveiled 379 new routes in an attempt to capitalise on the slow reopening of air travel in 
2021, but management said that Covid-19 has "continued to wreak havoc on our business". The group posted a 
first-quarter loss of (EURO)273m, wider than losses of (EURO)185m reported a year earlier, even as passenger 
traffic rebounded from 0.5m to 8.1m. An uptick in capacity in May and June wasn't enough to offset the blow dealt 
by Easter travel being cancelled and the increase in costs from getting planes back in the sky.
But higher costs won't last forever. Chief executive Michael O'Leary believes his company will have a "materially 
lower cost base" going forward, which will contribute to "an industry-leading recovery". The airline also says that 
FY22 traffic has "improved to a range of 90m to 100m", having previously been expected to hit the lower end of a 
range of 80m to 120m.
June's cash balance stood at (EURO)4.06bn, up from (EURO)3.15bn in March, and net debt fell from 
(EURO)2.28bn to (EURO)1.66bn.
First-half numbers from Heathrow airport also showcase the pain that Covid-19 restrictions have inflicted on the 
UK's travel industry. While Covidinduced cumulative losses stand at £2.9bn, management said that its "financing 
remains resilient" after it reduced cash burn by more than a half versus H1 2019.
Meanwhile, celebrations took place on the Pacific coast of the US this week as cruise ships launched for the first 
time in almost 18 months. Princess Cruises and Holland America - two lines belonging to listed group Carnival 
(CCL) - kicked off their summer season of exploring in Alaska over the weekend with the launch of one ship each 
out of the port of Seattle.
Ryanair and Heathrow numbers highlight Covid pain
Cruising has been especially badly hit during the pandemic. The outbreak of the virus on the Diamond Princess 
cruiseliner back in early 2020 has scared many potential customers away even as ships have relaunched. And the 
fallout from the lack of travel has impacted many industries, especially in the ports from which the boats normally 
dock and launch. HC & MB

Saint Helena. A remote Atlantic island chosen as the site of Napoleon Bonaparte's exile in 1815. Also one of the 
few places still featured on England's 'green list': a hallowed menu of holiday locations that people can travel to 
without needing to quarantine on their return.
Under Westminster's traffic light system, only a handful of countries have made the cut for zero self-isolation 
measures. That handful became sparser last week. On 3 June, the government announced that Portugal - the 
nation that had hosted football's Champions League Final just days earlier - would move to the 'amber list'. Such a 
label means 10 days of mandatory quarantine at home, with two Covid-19 tests on days two and eight.
The decision was due to "increased concern in the spread of variants of coronavirus", the transport department 
explained. "The situation in Portugal has required swift action to protect the gains made with the vaccine rollout," it 
said.
Yet the modifications to the travel rules coincided with news that more than half the UK adult population has now 
received two Covid-19 jabs: a dichotomy not lost on Britain's leading airline groups as they responded heatedly to 
the surprise change of tack.
Exacerbating the injury to such companies, no other countries have been added to the green list. The only 
alterations to the traffic light system were to shift seven more destinations into the no-go 'red' zone.
Travel shares in a tailspin The latest travel reshuffle has, in turn, put even more pressure on the air carriers that had 
hoped for a European summer revival after more than a year of flattened revenues and squeezed cash flows. Net 
Shrinking green list clips airlines' wings With Portugal downgraded to amber, carriers' shares have taken 
another hit.
airline industry losses stood at an estimated $126bn in 2020, according to the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA).
The market responded accordingly. Shares in easyJet (EZJ), British Airways owner International Consolidated 
Airlines (IAG), budget carrier Ryanair (RYA) and Wizz Air (WIZZ) all closed down 4-5 per cent last Thursday. Travel 
and tour operator TUI (TUI) tumbled 4.5 per cent.
Strong industry reaction easyJet had said as recently as 20 May that it was "looking forward to taking customers on 
a long-awaited holiday this summer" as the largest operator from the UK to greenlist countries. Such enthusiasm 
came as the group reported a 90 per cent decline in first-half revenues to £240m. The airline's load factor 
(passengers as a proportion of available seats) dropped more than a quarter to 63.7 per cent.
Chief executive Johan Lundgren called the government's "shock decision" a "huge blow" to those in or planning to 
visit Portugal. "The government has torn up its own rule book and ignored the science, throwing peoples' plans into 
chaos."
British Airways described the update as "incredibly disappointing and confusing". "With high levels of vaccinations 
in the UK being matched by other countries," the government should not be "turning its back on a traffic light model 
which we were led to believe was based firmly on scientific data", a spokesperson said. IAG posted a first-quarter 
adjusted operating loss of (EURO)1.1bn in early May.
Meanwhile, Ryanair condemned the UK government's decision, noting that more than two-fifths of Portugal's adults 
have received a Covid jab. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said there was "no medical or public health reason for 
moving Portugal from the green to the amber list".
Just a day before the government's Portugal announcement, Ryanair had posted a 0.07m jump in May traffic to 
1.8m passengers alongside a 79 per cent load factor.
Smaller carrier Wizz Air said that it would be cancelling all flights to Portugal. The airline had noted alongside its 
full-year results on 2 June that it was "cautiously optimistic about the recovery".
Green does not mean 'easy' Even travel to the diminutive green list is not straightforward. Several green countries 
do not have reciprocal entry rules in place. And, as this writer can attest after a Bank Holiday break, 'fit to fly' PCR 
tests can cost £75 each for next-day results.
The question now is how far the current squeeze should be extrapolated out into future performance forecasts. 
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo still believes easyJet, Ryanair and IAG have the balance-sheet strength to "survive a 
second lost summer". These three companies, each of which Khoo rates a 'hold' and which he notes are not the 
only airlines to highlight, "were the structural winners before the pandemic and they remain the structural winners 
afterwards".
"Fundamentally, all of those three airline groups have sound business models, efficient cost bases, strong balance 
sheets, and that showed through in good financial returns pre-pandemic," Khoo said. A well-financed airline "is 
more able to raise capital from private sector sources than an airline that was weak or structurally compromised 
before".
Balancing act Westminster faces an unenviable prospect: balancing the rate of vaccination in the UK with the 
cautious reopening of the economy. In any case, news this week that the EU parliament has backed a quarantine-
free digital travel pass will be welcomed by the sector.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched action against International Consolidated Airlines 
(IAG) subsidiary British Airways and Ryanair (RYA) over their refusal to give refunds to people during UK 
lockdowns, when they were "lawfully unable to fly" owing to restrictions imposed by the government.
The move comes after the CMA opened an investigation into the airlines sector in December following reports that 
consumers were being denied refunds for flights that they could not legally take. BA offered vouchers or rebooking 
and Ryanair only the option to rebook. MM

TEASYJET EZJ 989p CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY he airline industry has been in a holding pattern for longer 
than memory serves. Probably the last time when skies were this clear was in the immediate aftermath of the 911 
attacks, or perhaps when Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted in 2010. But those were temporary effects. The 
challenges posed by the travel restrictions put in place after Covid-19 took hold are different in terms of scale and 
the financial pressures faced by carriers across the globe.
To bear this out, the latest analysis from the IATA points to a post-tax industry loss of $47.7bn (£33.8bn) in 2021, 
admittedly an improvement of sorts on the $126bn aggregate loss for last year when global passenger numbers fell 
by 60 per cent.
But beyond the losses, the real problem for the carriers has been the scale of the cash outflows, with the cash-burn 
for this year estimated at $81bn. Most large airlines have raised enough capital to cover their medium-term cash 
commitments, but many of the smaller carriers had weak balance sheets and poor liquidity prior to the pandemic, so 
further government intervention and/ or industry consolidation is likely. State aid provisions have already gone out 
the window as several European airlines, most notably Alitalia, AirFrance/KLM and Lufthansa, were kept afloat by 
various national governments within the European Union.
Much depends on how rapidly and the extent to which utilisation rates improve, with the clinical situation on the 
ground - and resultant regulations - the chief determinant. The IATA analysis estimates that the global passenger

load factor (as a proportion of available seat miles) will come in at 67 per cent for 2021, roughly in line with the prior 
year, but substantially down on 2019 despite widespread route cancellations.
With negligible growth in international air traffic forecast for this year, airlines with a higher proportion of domestic 
routes are set to outperform the wider industry. That's good news for carriers stateside, but the European short-haul 
market has been badly hit.
You get a fair reflection of this through Ryanair's (RYA) March year-end figures which detailed an 81 per cent fall in 
revenue to (EURO)1.64bn (£1.41bn). The budget carrier revealed that traffic numbers fell to 27.5m from 149m (pre-
Covid-19), along with a 24-percentage point decline in the load factor. All of this was largely predictable, yet 
management felt unable to provide any meaningful guidance for FY22 given the variables at play.
The group is hoping to take delivery of the first of its Boeing 737-8200 fleet by the end of the month, an aircraft that 
management believes will "further widen the cost gap between Ryanair and all other European airlines for the next 
decade". The group has always employed narrow-body aircraft to serve its short-haul routes, but the Boeing model 
offers further benefits in terms of fuel consumption and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. That last environmental 
point is salient given that some long-haul airlines were already looking to delay widebody deliveries, or cancel 
existing orders, even prior to the pandemic.
The last thing airlines need is yet more planes sitting idle with international travel still on life-support. The Financial 
Times estimates that mothballing an aircraft can cost as much as $30,000 depending on the specific maintenance 
requirements.
On current rates of take-up, it is thought that around three-quarters of the population in North America and Europe 
will have been vaccinated by the third quarter. But although there is undoubtedly pent-up demand, with thousands 
of holidaymakers already booked for travel to "green list" countries, the fear is that the industry won't see the full 
benefits of the key summer holiday period, adding further pressure on industry balance sheets. We're nearly into 
June and the official government line is that you should avoid travelling to traditional summer holiday hotspots, such 
as Spain, France, Italy and Greece, unless you have a compelling reason to do so.
However, Portugal, another popular destination, made it onto the government's list of countries without travel 
quarantine restrictions. That's certainly good news for easyJet (EZJ) given the number of flights it normally runs to 
the country. Management said the airline is capable of ramping up operational capacity to 90 per cent of its current 
fleet in a short space of time. Indeed, the carrier added 105,000 seats after the announcement of the green list 
destinations.
Like its rival Ryanair, details of easyJet's March half-year figures make for grim reading: a headline loss of £701m, 
a 26.6 percentage point reduction in the load factor and an 89 per cent fall in passenger numbers. All predictable in 
a sense, but any further easing of restrictions is unlikely to trigger a sudden return to pre-pandemic volumes, so the 
airlines will probably have to endure another lean season, with 'liquidity' remaining the watchword for the industry. 
Prospects remain intertwined with the clinical situation on the ground. And until we have clarity on that front, the 
sector is best avoided.

News that Booker's successful ex-boss Charles Wilson has taken a 10 per cent stake in private equity-owned 
Menzies Distribution has set up an intriguing debate over whether there is still value in the 'distribution' arena of the 
newspaper industry, along with some interesting speculation over the future of small cap Smiths News (SNWS).
Menzies itself was spun out of John Menzies, the aircraft services company, and sold to private equity firm Endless 
for £74.5m in 2018.
Smiths News has endured a bumpy ride over the past few years after rebranding itself as Connect in 2014, and 
then back again to Smiths News last year. The pandemic hit sales and profits hard, and the group had to negotiate 
a £120m refinancing package with its lenders in November - ripe, on the face of it, for a takeover.
Whether such a deal could realistically get off the ground would depend on the view of the Competition and Markets 
Authority (CMA). The watchdog has been quiet on consolidation within the print wholesale sector. It raised no 
objection to Smiths' acquisition of Bertram's, a book wholesaler in 2009, and its purchase of educational supplier 
Consortium in 2012. But the relative failure of Smiths' diversification strategy is behind many of its difficulties, with a 
dominant position in the print distribution market a magnet for regulatory action.
For those with a stomach for risk, Smiths News does represent an interesting special situation. If nothing else, a 
business that has trucks and warehouses all over the country has some attraction at a time while distribution 
remains so important.

Ryanair's (RYA) results have laid bare the heavy blow experienced by air transport companies at the hands of 
Covid-19. Full-year traffic fell more than four-fifths to 27.5m passengers, wiping (EURO)6.9bn off the group's top 
line and plunging it into a pre-tax loss of (EURO)1.1bn - down from profits of (EURO)670m.
Uncertainty prevails about when and where restrictions will be eased, Ryanair said, as it projected that FY2022 
traffic "is likely to be towards the lower end of our previously guided range of 80m to 120m passengers".

Ryanair's (RYA) annual losses for the period ending March 2021 won't be as bad as first feared, the carrier said this 
week - but next year's a different story; one whose narrative has already been dictated, in part, by the "slow rollout 
in the EU of Covid-19 vaccines".
It follows that the group doesn't "share the recent optimism of certain analysts" about FY2022's profits, believing 
instead that the period "is currently close to breakeven". Still, the London and Dublin-quoted airline said it 
maintained substantial liquidity with year-end cash (31 March) of more than (EURO)3.15bn (£2.71bn).

• Airline stocks suddenly reversed their upward trend this week • Investors are questioning whether international 
travel can eventually recover to pre-pandemic levels
Ladies and gentlemen holding stocks in airline companies, this is your captain speaking: we're going to be 
experiencing some serious turbulence ahead.
In recent months European airline shares have started to lift off, rising cautiously from the historic lows that they hit 
after the coronavirus pandemic first halted international travel.
But this week that trajectory suddenly reversed. In only a matter of days, the share prices of London-listed Ryanair 
(RYA), Jet2 ( JET2) and British Airways-owner International Airlines Group (IAG) have each dropped more than 10 
per cent from their recent highs.
That fall was mirrored by travel stocks across the world, from American Airlines (US:AAL) to Lufthansa 
(DE:LUFTHANSA), as investors started to lose faith in what they had hoped would be one of the biggest recovery 
stories of the year. But why are they reaching for the parachutes now? And should other investors hold on, or get 
out while they can?UK/EU turbulence The recent sell-off in airline stocks was largely prompted by renewed doubts 
over whether Brits will be able to roll out their beach towels in Spain and Greece this www.summer.UK airlines 
depend on maintaining travel between the country and the EU. Brits may be divided over their feelings about 
Europe, but Brexiteers and Remainers alike love a holiday on the continent; in 2019, they took 78 per cent of their 
trips there.
But where Brexit failed to immediately curb the enthusiasm for
The three things stopping airline shares taking off Airlines are experiencing serious turbulence on the markets. 
Oliver Telling asks why
European holidays, the ongoing battle for Covid jabs could succeed.
As London and Brussels lock horns over vaccine exports, rollout on the continent is running at almost a quarter of 
UK levels. Brits are looking forward to leaving lockdown, but France, Italy and Germany are imposing new 
restrictions.
With this in mind, UK ministers are now warning against booking travel to Europe in the coming months. Mike 
Tildesley, a member of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, told the BBC that 
international travel was unlikely for the "average holidaymaker" this summer.
For as long as the EU has to scramble for vaccine supplies to tackle its rising coronavirus cases, airline fleets 
across the UK and Europe are expected to remain largely grounded.
Environmental headwinds Despite this short-term disturbance, many investors are holding out in hope of a surge in 
bookings once holidaymakers are eventually able to fly abroad. Some airlines should receive the financing they 
need to tide them over until then; this week IAG secured $1.8bn (£1.3bn) in new funding to shore up its balance 
sheet.
But travel companies also face headwinds that were gathering pace long before the pandemic.
For one, there is growing pressure on what is one of the most polluting industries to funnel more of its income into 
cleaning up its act. The International Air Transport Association, the industry trade body, is now considering a 
commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the Financial Times reported this month.
To achieve this, carriers will have to significantly scale up investment in more efficient engines and sustainable 
fuels. The industry has also proposed a carbon reduction scheme that will require airlines to buy credits to match 
their emissions.
But this scheme is also coming under fire in Brussels, with an unpublished report suggesting, reportedly, that 
expanding the EU's own carbon trading programme would have a bigger impact. Don't be surprised if, once airlines 
recover from the current crisis, regulators start getting tougher.
Changing travel habits Although the past year may have permanently changed some consumer habits, many 
investors are betting that the desire to take a break from work and home life will only have increased.
But that doesn't mean airlines are sure to recover to their pre-pandemic strength once that pent-up demand is 
unleashed. Holiday habits may also be changing.
Many Brits are discovering the pleasures of a staycation. In a move to encourage this trend further, the government 
announced plans this week to slash aviation tax on domestic flights, while lifting the duty on international travel. But 
not everyone needs to buy a plane ticket to traverse across the country.
Perhaps more importantly, a significant proportion of income for airlines comes not from holiday goers, but from 
business travel. In 2019, nearly a fifth of passengers at UK airports were on business trips, according to a survey by 
the Civil Aviation Authority.
Now, the twin forces of environmental concerns and implementation of remote working are spurring many 
companies to slash travel budgets for the coming years. That spending could remain permanently lower.

Boris Johnson's route to "reclaiming our freedoms" is a blow to many industries that have spent almost a year 
struggling for survival.
On 29 March, the prime minister's 'stay at home' rule will be removed, which means people can meet up in socially-
distanced groups of six in the park, at open-air sports facilities, or in private gardens. But pubs, restaurants, holiday 
lets, theme parks and non-essential retailers will have to wait at least another two weeks before they can open their 
doors again, meaning they will miss out on the big Easter bank holiday weekend.
The government has not given clear instructions regarding the return to offices, meaning it is very unlikely that 
businesses will look to sign new leases any time soon. Flexible workspace providers have already started to reveal 
the pain inflicted from working from home as occupancy has declined and pricing fallen with it. But these flexible 
providers, including Workspace (WKP), could benefit as cities recover from the pandemic and seek to decamp from 
big offices into more fluid spaces. It is the big commercial landlords whose business models rely on long-term lease 
agreements that could struggle as the world of work changes for good.
Other companies look primed for the rebound: no doubt supermarkets will enjoy another surge from Britons in a 
celebratory mood, just as they did over Christmas. While Theresa May has cautioned that the review of 
international travel on 12 April will not give Brits enough time to plan their summer holidays, we disagree. A nation 
in desperate need of a break doesn't need much time to plan. The summer holiday deals currently being offered by 
RyanAir (RYA) EASYJET (EZJ) and Tui (TUI) are adding to the temptation.

Summer bookings are up 250 per cent at EASYJET (EZJ). The volume of Brits booking "well-deserved holidays" is 
hardly surprising "after the horrendous year we have had", said chief executive Johan Lundgren in an interview with 
BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Early bookings will provide some consolation to the airlines, which have a rocky few months of restrictions ahead. 
The complete closure of all travel corridors adds further pressure to EASYJET and its peers, which are already 
operating enormously restricted schedules.
Michael O'Leary at Ryanair (RYA) has previously expressed concern about the impact of pre-departure testing, 
which makes it difficult for cheap, short haul airlines to put lots of flights on. Holiday-makers may hesitate to take an 
expensive test and risk quarantine for the sake of just a few days away.
But Mr Lundgren is looking with optimism to vaccine progress, and hopes the government will eventually put a plan 
in place to help the travel sector recover.

Hostelworld (HSW) is a company that some younger readers may be familiar with. My first experience of 
Hostelworld was through a (EURO)9-a-night hostel in Prague, and boy did it look (EURO)9 a night. It resembled a 
prison. But, along with our £40 Ryanair return flights, a friend and I enjoyed a four-night trip away all for £200. 
Unfortunately, he blew 10 per cent of his total budget on gin and tonics near Orloj, the astronomical clock tower, but 
the trip showed the ease of booking hostels and I was hooked.
It's not surprising, then, that Hostelworld dominates this market, especially having acquired competitor 
Hostelbookers. And given the march of the pandemic this year, it also isn't surprising that, despite what on paper 
looks like a decent business model - it's a booking platform for the hostel owners it partners with - the stock has 
struggled, ultimately meaning that little value has been created for shareholders.
Chart 1 shows the stock's downward struggle. It has fallen from the heights of 400p down to well below 100p this 
year. There's a lot of recent overhead supply to churn through before the stock breaks out into all-time highs.
In 2018, the company launched its 'Roadmap for growth' after a strategic review. It's fair to say the market hasn't 
bought into this - the stock was downtrending before the name Covid-19 had even been coined. Hostelworld wants 
to broaden its technological offering to make it easier for hostels to manage and sell, and believes there are 
significant opportunities to build a "broader catalogue of experiential travel products beyond hostel 
accommodation".
Why Hostelworld could be a 5-star trading opportunity Michael Taylor explains why unloved and low-quality 
companies can offer a source of rich pickings for quic....
Management also believes that there are opportunities for more acquisitions in the future. I am sceptical about this 
because if the
original business is struggling, why are acquisitions going to make it any better? Surely this is just sticking plasters 
on a gaping hole? Personally, I don't see why anyone would invest in Hostelworld, but then this column is about 
finding and exploiting trading opportunities.
There are many trades in the market based on companies that are of low quality and unloved by everyone.
If one works through regulator news announcements with a keen eye, you might be surprised at what you can find. 
A few
weeks ago (5 November), I bought The Works (WRKS) as it announced its half-year trading update. The company 
said it was trading significantly ahead of expectations and that its cash resources were adequate to support the 
business in "this new period of increased restrictions". I bought, and posted this on my Twitter, and four weeks later 
the stock is trading at 100 per cent above my entry. I've taken some offthe table, but the trend may continue.
Hostelworld may also be an opportunity for a beaten-up and battered company to move further. Trading is about 
supply and demand, not fundamentals. Far too many traders concern themselves with fundamentals, and while 
good fundamentals are certainly no terrible thing, sometimes they can be a lead weight on the stock price's 
volatility.
Think about it: if a solid market darling releases results that are excellent, what can happen to the share price? 
Sure, it is likely to go up (provided the market wasn't expecting far better - think Boohoo's (BOO) results in 
September 2017), but it is rare for a company
that is already well liked by the market to move stratospherically.
But if a clapped-out company tells the market that trading is now significantly ahead when everyone was expecting 
in line or even a warning, then that is a piece of news that can move the needle - think De La Rue (DLAR) in June 
2020. Always think about what can move the price, and what the market thinks. Because when there is a mismatch 
between expectations and reality, that is our opportunity.
Chart 2 shows the potential opportunity in Hostelworld's shares. I've drawn a resistance line on the chart with the 
recent high at 85p. We can see the stock's reaction on Vaccine Day in early November, moving the stock to above 
80p from 50p in a few trading sessions.
Since then, the price has been trading in a sideways range. It shows that there is sufficient buying power to match 
any sellers at this level, although volumes are thin. But if the stock can break out of its previous high at 85p then I 
would want to take a long position. I'd put my stop outside of the stop-loss liquidity, which would be the recent low, 
and so I'd put this around 76/77p.
What I'd like to see here is extended consolidation, and a high momentum breakout on volume. These patterns are 
often nicely profitable as the stock surges and sees traders wanting to pick up stock on the breakout retest.
The company is also well financed, having raised £13.8m in gross proceeds in June, and closing the month out with 
(EURO)29.4m and a (EURO)3.5m short-term financing facility. There is a small amount of debt on the balance 
sheet, but not enough to worry about a placing. It's always best to check the little things as nobody likes being 
surprised with a discounted placing.
One thing that did stand out in the placing is the fact that the directors weren't keen, with the biggest purchase 
being 31,358 shares at 72p a share. Directors can't go buying and selling like we can, but this isn't exactly a 
conviction buy.
Why Hostelworld could be a 5-star trading opportunity Michael Taylor explains why unloved and low-quality 
companies can offer a source of rich pickings for quic....
In my opinion, Hostelworld is unlikely to ever become a high-quality company that the market fawns over. But just 
because it may never be a stock market darling, doesn't mean we can't make any money from it. I'll be buying the 
breakout at 85p.

Ryanair (RYA) took aim at European governments and "uncoordinated travel restrictions", which threaten to further 
reduce its aim of flying 38m passengers in its 2021 full year. The airline only managed to carry 17m travellers over 
its first half, compared with 86m in the corresponding period in 2019, with the pandemic all but completely 
grounding its fleet between mid March and the end of June. Chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC that 
passengers would not receive refunds for flights that remain operational, despite a number of governments advising 
their citizens not to travel.
Share price 1,177¢
p 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 2019 2020
The collapse in air travel was reflected in figures provided by PPHE Hotel Group (PPH), which said on average a 
third of its rooms were occupied over nine months to 30 September.
The deferral of capital expenditure and paycuts helped slash the airline's operating costs by two-thirds to 
(EURO)1.35bn (£1.22bn) over the period. Ryanair raised (EURO)1.25bn in funds via a share placing and bond 
issuance in September, and ended the period with a cash position of (EURO)4.5bn, while it has more than 
(EURO)1.5bn in debt due next year.
FactSet consensus figures are for losses per share of 76¢ in 2021, followed by earnings per share of 60¢ in 2022.
Ryanair expects its second-half losses to be even worse than those through to September. The airline is confident, 
however, that it will emerge from this crisis as a leaner operator, in part helped by its greener Boeing 737 Max 
aircraft, which it expects to receive early next year. While the airline is set for a bumpy few months, and the general

economic outlook in Europe remains gloomy, its reduced cost base should contribute to margin improvement and 
provide room for lower fares, helping to ensnare new customers as competitors exit the market. AJ

Wizz Air (WIZZ) chief executive József Váradi has banked £2.8m after an associated legal entity, Vaxco Holdings, 
disposed of 75,000 shares last week.
The Hungarian airline's disclosure of the disposal preceded news that it had operated at 80 per cent capacity in 
August. Wizz warned, however, that it expects this to drop to 60 per cent for its second financial quarter, as travel 
restrictions return in Europe amid a spike in coronavirus cases in some countries.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has lambasted government measures to restrict border access 
and impose quarantines. "Too many governments are fighting a global pandemic in isolation with a view that 
closing borders is the only solution," IATA director general and chief executive Alexandre de Juniac said.
Capacity may remain at around 60 per cent for Wizz's third quarter if current travel restrictions persist, the airline 
observed, which is lower than the 80 per cent level it previously expected. Wizz's August load factor, which shows 
the percentage of available seating that is occupied by passengers, sat at 71 per cent, which was just shy of 
Ryanair's (RYA) August level of 73 per cent.
The airline cautioned that capacity may come down even further and that it may ground part of its fleet as winter 
sets in as it bids to protect its cash levels. Wizz had (EURO)1.59bn (£1.41bn) in cash at the end of June, which was 
only 3 per cent beneath its cash position at the end of June 2019. The self-proclaimed "fastest-growing European 
airline" added two new UK bases, a host of routes and four new Airbus aircraft last month, taking its fleet to 130 
jets.
Wizz's latest annual report indicates that Mr Váradi had a stake of 2 per cent in the company in the year ending 31 
March 2020. The airline did not respond to requests for comment.
Wizz Air chief executive banks £2.8m
The chief executive's disposal represents a very small proportion of his holding. Wizz Air is well-capitalised and its 
growth plans are a sign of confidence amidst the carnage that is enveloping airlines. But air passenger numbers are 
proving slow to recover to normal levels, and further coronavirus setbacks could threaten Wizz shares' own 
resurgence. Sell at 3,678p.

International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) is weighing up a (EURO)2.75bn (£2.5bn) rights issue to shore up its 
balance sheet. The British Airways owner has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, posting a (EURO)535m 
adjusted operating loss in the first three months of 2020.
The group had (EURO)10bn of undrawn borrowing facilities at the end of April, although its half-year results on 31 
July will give a clearer indication of its finances. While a firm decision on an equity raise has yet to be made, the 
new UK quarantine for passengers arriving from Spain could add further impetus.
Taking the industry by surprise, the policy shift sent shares across the travel sector tumbling. TUI's (TUI) shares fell 
by 11 per cent on Monday 27 July, while EASYJET (EZJ), Dart (DTG) and IAG all finished the day down 8 per cent.
The fear is that other European destinations could be removed from the 'safe list' and holidaymakers who were 
planning a post-lockdown getaway could shelve their plans. The uncertainty could also impact advance bookings 
for 2021. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) called the new measures "a big setback for consumer 
confidence", suggesting a blanket quarantine is a disproportionate response.
The new rules also add to Ryanair's (RYA) woes, with the airline revealing it had slumped to a (EURO)185m net 
loss in the three months to 30 June. The group expects to remain lossmaking across the summer and says its 
biggest fear is a 'second wave' of infections across Europe.
As travel operators cut costs and jobs to weather the crisis, hopes of salvaging what is left of 2020 look to have 
been dashed. With new cases rising across Europe, there could be further lockdowns (and losses) to come.

Travel companies were dealt a heavy blow this week when the UK Foreign Office advised against all non-essential 
travel to Spain and the government imposed a two-week quarantine on anyone returning from the country. Shares 
in British Airways owner IAG (IAG), Ryanair (RYA), easyJet (EZJ) and Jet2 owner Dart Group (DTG) were among 
those hit by the news. Spain had been on the list of countries that UK travellers could visit for holidays without 
needing to isolate afterwards - but the guidance has changed after an increase in coronavirus cases.

In April, unemployment in the UK remained steady month on month at 3.9 per cent. In May, roughly 600,000 fewer 
Brits were on company payrolls than the previous month. These two starkly contrasting indicators of employment 
reflect the painfully blurred economic outlook of a country stumbling back to its feet in the wake of an 
unprecedented shock.
Britain's labour market is in a state of "suspended animation" thanks to the government's job retention scheme, 
according to Samuel Tombs at think-tank Pantheon Macroeconomics. Furloughed staff - 9m of them at the last 
count - are neither employed nor unemployed and the true impact of coronavirus on the jobs market will only 
become clear once the scheme is removed.
Still, the fact that employment has remained near its all-time high at 76.4 per cent in a period where the UK's 
economic output has fallen 5 per cent year on year, is credit to the furlough scheme. True to its word, the 
government has protected jobs during the worst of the lockdown meaning companies have staff on hand to help 
them reopen as lockdown eases.
But getting back to normal is not simple. Companies are still facing huge rental and debt expenses, while 
uncertainty regarding revenue generation in the coming months - something that rests uncomfortably on the 
shoulders of the 1m/2m social distancing rule - means many have been forced to shut up shop.
Indeed, the breadth of industries that have already announced extensive job cuts is stark. HSBC (HSBA) is 
restarting a redundancy plan that was paused following the outbreak of coronavirus, and will cut 35,000 jobs over 
Employment at the heart of the UK's recovery; ECONOMY ; New payroll data clouds the outlook for economic 
recovery
the medium-term, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. The memo reportedly pointed to falling profits 
and a difficult economic outlook.
Car manufacturers and engineers, whose tight margins haven't coped with supply chain disruption, have big staff 
reduction plans; Rolls Royce (RR.), Bentley and Aston Martin Lagonda (AML) among them. Travel companies and 
airlines, including both of Britain's low-cost carriers, EASYJET (EZJ) and Ryanair (RYA), have had to make almost 
a third of their workers redundant. Even oil behemoth BP (BP.) hasn't coped with the disruption; 10,000 members of 
staff - many of them in middle management - will be made redundant by the end of the year.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg. As doors open and money starts flowing through companies again, 
redundancy payments are likely to increase. The pubs and restaurant sector, largely absent from the jobs purge so 
far, is likely to dominate the next round of cuts as the challenges of operating food and drink venues in a post-
coronavirus world become clearer. For now, companies are heavily lobbying the government to reduce its social 
distancing rule to 1m as this will allow most venues to operate at almost full capacity. At 2m of social distancing, 
hospitality companies will struggle to make money. It is hardly worth them reopening.
Even more important than the 1m or 2m rule is a public willingness to go out and spend money. The queues outside 
Primark as non-essential retailers opened their doors for the first time on Monday suggest the nation is hungry for 
spending. By 5pm on the day, research firm Springboard said footfall was nearly 40 per cent higher than last week.
But a surge in footfall does not necessarily translate into higher expenditure. Diane Wehrle from Springboard thinks 
that the rush to shops is more reflective of a nation desperate to do something new, than one feeling flush with 
cash. "It's not about buying stuff," she told the BBC, "it's about having the opportunity to have a normal life again."
The queues certainly don't tell the full story.
Under current social distancing rules, shops are operating at 30 per cent capacity, meaning footfall on Monday - 
while up week on week - was still 40 per cent lower than it was this time last year. And with virus nervousness still 
rife, footfall and spending isn't expected to return to previous levels any time soon.
Meanwhile, with unemployment balancing on a knife edge, the nation is hardly in a position to splurge. The health 
of the jobs market is at the heart of a continuous spiral that has the capacity to either alleviate or exacerbate the 
UK's economic crisis. Low jobs means little public optimism. And without optimism, a willingness to spend and an 
ability to pay taxes, the UK is going to struggle to lift itself out of its current debt hole.
It's not all doom and gloom. Amid the carnage, some companies have resolved to find new ways of working and 
delivering goods. Convenience stores and local high streets have seen a big uptick in footfall, according to 
Springboard data. Meanwhile, the purge of the high street and hospitality sector will leave space for well-run 
companies to expand. Greggs (GRG), Young & Co's Brewery (YNGA) and Games Workshop (GAW) have all 
reported sensible reopening plans and demonstrated decent resilience in the past few months. The latter has fared 
so much better than expected, it's giving back its furlough payments.
But with the full weight of coronavirus yet to be revealed in jobs data and a new wave starting to emerge in Beijing, 
now is not the time for blind optimism. Britain's post-coronavirus policy is crucial. One mis-step could leave the UK 
with one of the slowest economic recoveries in Europe, as well as its highest death toll.

14-day quarantine Ryanair (RYA), EASYJET (EZJ) and International Consolidated Airlines (IAG)-owned British 
Airways have launched legal action against the government over its coronavirus quarantine measures. The airlines 
warned that asking those entering the UK to self-isolate for 14 days "will have a devastating effect on British tourism 
and the wider economy and destroy thousands of jobs". Global air travel almost entirely ground to a halt during 
April, but flights have since picked up - rising by 30 per cent last month, according to the International Air Transport 
Association.

You would think that someone who has been actively investing for the best part of 80 years would be forgiven the 
odd misstep. Not so Warren Buffett. In early May, there was almost an element of schadenfreude in the press 
reaction to news that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its shares in the four largest US airlines after booking a $50bn 
(£40.3bn) firstquarter loss due to a sharp contraction in the paper value of its investments.
For some commentators, the fact that market valuations had collapsed due to government intervention was of 
secondary importance to the seeming inability of Mr Buffett to follow his own advice on investing in the airline 
industry. He once famously quipped that generations of investors would have been better off if someone had shot 
Orville Wright down at Kitty Hawk. That comment was just one in a long line of industry critiques delivered to 
Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, citing a string of pitfalls ranging from historical earnings volatility to the threat 
posed by irrational competition.
It is difficult to understand why someone like Warren Buffett, who places great emphasis on the importance of 
"economic moats" would make a repeat foray into the airline industry. But by midway through 2016 Berkshire 
Hathaway did just that.
Crisis gives way to consolidation Admittedly, the industry in the US had enjoyed a period of relative stability after 
the wave of bankruptcies and mergers that came in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Stability in the sense that 
many of the price disruptors had been gradually weeded out of the market, a process that has also been playing out 
in Europe over the past couple of years.
Big picture: Global airlines on a wing and a prayer; A costly miscalculation by the 'Sage of Omaha' has 
highlighted the structural pitfalls of the airline indus....
The upshot is that internal flights in the continental US are now dominated by four principal carriers. The formation 
of an oligopoly does not automatically give rise to price collusion, but it rarely works in the favour of consumers, 
even though it has helped to mitigate the negative effects of the industry's pricing wars.
A race to the bottom on pricing Throughout its history, civil aviation has evolved from being largely the preserve of 
the affluent to a form of mass transit. Deregulation was integral to this process, but the proliferation of low-cost 
players resulted in unsustainable - and in many cases, ruinous - price competition. Legacy carriers were forced to 
match their low-cost counterparts or risk losing market share. However, this resulted in big losses across the 
industry.
As civil aviation ticketing has effectively become a race to the bottom, it is difficult for any airline to gain a distinct 
commercial advantage. It is not as though the likes of Ryanair (RYA) or United Airlines (US:UAL) hold any 
intellectual property assets that differentiates them from the competition, nor are the barriers to entry particularly 
daunting given that aircraft leasing expanded rapidly as low-cost carriers took centre stage.
Capacity expansion versus black swan events In an era of budget travel, with downward pressure on pricing, 
margins are compressed, and airlines become reliant on capacity expansion to boost earnings. It is that last point 
that may have reconciled Warren Buffett to the airline industry again.
Airport Council International (ACI) World, a non-profit industry body, estimates that global passenger traffic will 
double to more than 17bn annually by 2037, with Asia-Pacific's airports predicted to account for half of worldwide 
passenger traffic growth. Emerging and developing economies will account for almost 60 per cent of all passenger 
traffic by 2040. It is a familiar refrain, but those estimates may have to be recalibrated due to the knock-on effects of 
Covid-19.
Growth stalled in the global aviation industry for three years following the 9/11 attacks and passenger volumes have 
periodically been suppressed by events such as the Sars epidemic, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, further terrorist 
outrages and the financial crisis of 2008. All that should give pause for thought, even before you factor in the threat 
posed by "irrational competition". The Dow Jones Airlines index has lost 62 per cent of its value since mid-February 
and the longterm damage to the industry through centrally enforced travel bans is difficult to estimate.
It is certainly possible that the growth in worldwide passenger numbers could be constrained if global trade is 
negatively affected over the long haul. If more carriers are either forced to the wall, or become reliant on state 
subsidies, then further industry consolidation will follow, pushing up prices for consumers. In a sense, a reduced 
pool of investable options and greater predictability on the pricing front are positive from an investment angle, but 
the airline industry has burned investors time and time again. The Sage of Omaha has heeded his own advice and 
withdrawn from the market. Investors would be wise to do the same.

Ryanair (RYA) expects to record a (EURO)200m (£178m) loss in its first quarter as a result of the recent collapse in 
aviation traffic. Most of the airline's fleet has been glued to the tarmac since mid-March and the knock-on effects of 
the pandemic have been calamitous. The low-cost carrier anticipates carrying around 80m passengers over its 
2021 financial year, down on the 154m travellers it had targeted for the period.
Groundings in the period under review cut full-year traffic by 5m passengers, thereby constraining pre-tax profits by 
more than (EURO)40m. However, trading patterns prior to the lockdown were encouraging. The group experienced 
a 10 per cent sales lift over its full year, driven by a combination of traffic growth, fare increases and a 20 per cent 
jump in ancillary revenues, as more passengers opted for priority boarding and preferred seat services. But the 
airline's overall pre-tax profits sustained a (EURO)353m blow linked to its 2021 fuel hedges, as the price of crude 
collapsed due to a sharp fall in global demand and Saudi/Russian inaction on production cuts.
Ryanair has cut its average weekly cash burn from (EURO)200m to (EURO)60m. It is negotiating with partners to 
reduce new plane deliveries, with traffic expected to be substantially weaker over the coming year. It has also 
suspended share buybacks, having returned (EURO)581m to shareholders over its 2020 full-year.
Broker Citi forecasts full-year 2021 pretax losses and diluted losses per share of (EURO)829m and 66¢, 
respectively, before pre-tax profits and earnings per share of (EURO)615m and 49¢ in 2022.
The carrier's routes look more suitable for resumption than those of long-haulfocused peers, and it has moved 
quickly to renegotiate jet deliveries and cut working capital demands, perhaps entailing up to 3,250 job losses and 
pay cuts for staff. Chief executive Michael O'Leary lamented the "unlawful state aid" provided to European travel 
peers and said the airline will not be seeking equivalent support. He also lambasted the government's proposal for 
a 14-day quarantine period for inbound travellers. The markets reacted positively to the decisive measures under 
way, but much depends on the duration and severity of Europe-wide travel restrictions. AJ

reak out the suntan lotion and your castanets.
Ryanair (RYA) plans to reinstate 40 per cent of its normal flight schedule from the beginning of July.
BFliers will have to undergo temperature checks prior to boarding and will be encouraged to wear face masks, the 
latter an obligatory measure for cabin crews. Queuing for toilets will be prohibited on board, although I suppose that 
is better than charging punters for the privilege of using them.
How effective all this will be when you are breathing recirculated air in a pressurised steel tube at 37,000 feet is 
anyone's guess. But health secretary Matt Hancock, himself a Covid-19 survivor, decided to rain on everyone's 
parade anyway, insisting that it is unlikely that sunseekers will be able to get away during the regular summer 
holiday season. The health secretary added that this was not the official government line, at least not yet. But all the 
sybarites out there may be forced to make do with Skegness on a wet weekend in October.
You could be forgiven for thinking that policy on travel restrictions is being made on the hoof. The government's 
latest update provides little succour for travel operators in the face of an existential crisis. Consider the plight of TUI 
AG (TUI). The German travel group has been unable to offer any holidays that kick off on or before 11 June 2020, 
thereby forcing it to offer voucher refund credits to holidaymakers with prior bookings that have been cancelled. The 
cash redemption process is a somewhat arduous affair by all accounts, but you can understand why TUI might want 
to either delay or limit the drain on cash reserves.
TUI in the shadow of Thomas Cook Mark Robinson is companies editor ; After a solid start to 2020, the 
German travel group finds itself in a fight for survival
The group was given added firepower at the end of March, when the German government gave the green light to a 
bridging loan of (EURO)1.8bn (£1.59bn) from the KfW, Germany's state-owned development bank. The loan was 
put in place while TUI renegotiated its revolving credit facility with a consortium of www.banks.No dividends are to 
be paid while the facility remains in place, but at least the travel group's debt covenants will not be tested until 
September 2021.
Understandably, management has been trimming the sails, invoking force majeure clauses on all the group's third-
party hotel contracts, which contributed to a 70 per cent reduction in monthly cash costs. Capital expenditure 
commitments have been halved and incremental aircraft leases are being renegotiated. Over the long haul, the 
group plans to reduce its running costs by nearly a third on a permanent basis, necessitating around 8,000 job 
losses.
Harsh medicine certainly, but will that be enough? Taking account of lease liabilities, net debt from continuing 
operations as of the March half-year increased by (EURO)2.94bn to (EURO)4.90bn, representing 176 per cent of 
net assets, which is somewhat worrisome with the debt-driven collapse of Thomas Cook fresh in the memory.
Given wider issues, the group's half-year figures to March only tell us so much. At (EURO)6.64bn, half-year sales 
were broadly flat, while reported losses were exacerbated by lower margins and a one-off charge of (EURO)77m 
relating to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max fleet. Sales and profits are normally weighted to the second half, 
but there is no specific guidance for the September year-end. One suspects it will not be pretty.
The good news is that 35 per cent of the 2020 summer program is still booked, but even if there is a mad scramble 
for bookings once restrictions are lifted, certain segments of the business could continue to suffer regardless. You 
are left wondering about the public's appetite for maritime adventures following the Covid-19 outbreak. Few retirees 
will be hankering for a berth on any vessel if they think it will go the way of the Marie Celeste. This is a concern 
given the ongoing integration of Hapag-Lloyd Cruises within the group's joint venture with Royal Caribbean Cruises.
The group has around (EURO)2.1bn in cash and undrawn facilities to see it through the coming months - and you 
imagine it will need every cent and penny. There was a net cash outflow of (EURO)734m through the period, largely 
reflecting the second-half weighting, although any seasonal improvement is far from guaranteed in FY2020. And 
cash refunds for cancelled holidays are still expected to run at "mid-single-digit hundred millions per month" 
(presumably that equates to (EURO)500m). Everything considered, it is probably just as well that the European 
Union's state-aid provisions have gone out the window.

EasyJet (EZJ) has been a sometimesturbulent ride for those who have been on board since its flotation in 1995. 
Founded by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, EASYJET has copied a business model exploited by Southwest Airlines that 
focuses on low-cost pricing and efficiency. Despite Ryanair being the clear leader in this sector, with its tacky yellow 
and blue livery (a classic 'no frills' trick to make us believe little money has been spent on design), EASYJET has 
forged a robust business and enjoys being a member of the FTSE 100.
Long-term shareholders may now be getting frustrated, however, as the shares traded below 900p in October 2018, 
rallied and doubled by July 2018, only to come back and tag the same level around 900p again just 12 months later.
Looking at Chart 1, we can see that the price rose again to a high of 1,550p, but in just a few weeks has tumbled 
and fallen out of the sky thanks to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Given that EASYJET's planes are 
grounded, this means that not only is it not taking any revenue, but its costs are still required to be met. The 
company was in the media recently for receiving £600m in government-supported loans despite paying out a 
dividend to shareholders. Many accused the corporation of robbing Peter (the taxpayer) to pay Paul (the 
shareholders).
However, the ex-dividend date was 27 February, only three days after the FTSE 100 began to make its lurch 
downwards. It was also after the ex-dividend date, the point at which the company was legally forced to pay the 
dividend to shareholders; withhold the dividend and shareholders could claim they had been sold the shares under 
false pretences - an argument I agree with. Sir Stelios himself also came under pressure from media suggestions 
EasyJet : prepare for landing A boardroom bunfight and a global pandemic have rattled the airline's investors, 
but amplified the volatility that traders love
that he should forfeit his dividend - but he argued that his business and charitable donations are separate, and 
asked why should he give up his dividend only for it to end up in the pocket of another corporation such as Airbus? 
Indeed, Sir Stelios has called for the EASYJET board to cancel the expected £4.5bn of payments to Airbus between 
2020 and 2023, calling it the "elephant in the room" and the biggest risk to the survival of the company. EasyJet's 
current market capitalisation is just under £2.1bn and with no aircraft in the sky, cancelling the order does appear to 
make sense. Sir Stelios and his family own just over a third of the company, and they have called for an emergency 
meeting to remove non-executive John Barton and chief executive Johan Lundgren from the company.
But what does all this disagreement add up to from a trading perspective? Coming back to Chart 1, we can see that 
EASYJET has traded in a range from 2015, confirming the 2015 highs as resistance and the October 2016 lows as 
support. I find it helpful to draw these trendlines on charts, as very often the price will tag these levels as traders 
across the world view the same patterns.
It also shows the importance of taking profits on cyclical shares such as airlines, as 25 years later the share price - 
for all of EASYJET's accomplishments - is now less than 50 per cent above the IPO price. From its highs, the stock 
has shed nearly 70 per cent of its market cap, a brutal haircut for any long-term buy-and-hold investor.
Nor does the future provide any certainty, either. Warren Buffett announced that he had sold out of all of his airline 
stocks at the weekend - an unprecedented act from the Berkshire Hathaway co-founder. If the Sage of Omaha 
doesn't see airlines as fit to hold, it begs the question: why should anyone else? On Monday, airline stocks fell 
significantly as traders anticipated selling from investors and so they front-ran this selling. Unexpected news tends 
to have volatile reactions.
Looking at Chart 2, EASYJET has very much been an intraday trader's plaything. The moves are so large one can 
be long and short several times in a single day, and the chart appears again to be range-bound. When stocks trade 
in a range for extended periods of time, the volatility when the price breaks out of that range expands. This is what 
Bollinger bands look for, and new traders might find it helpful to use these as a guide.
We can see that the price fell through the 500p level, dropping almost a fifth to hit an intraday low of 410p, before 
coming back to close positive.
Since then, the price has struggled to break the 700p level three times and confirmed the support at 500p.
Who knows what will happen to EASYJET in the future? Nobody knows, nor do we need to in order to trade the 
stock. If the stock made a convincing breakout from 700p I would trade the stock long despite being bearish on the 
business outlook. Currently, the 500p price area looks to be under threat again, and if we saw the price take out the 
410p low then I feel it a good risk/reward trade to short the stock with a tight stop.
However, a note of caution. Unexpected news can gap a stock up or down, and so taking overnight risk is not 
something I am interested in doing unless I can finance a larger risk with paper profit. It's very easy to sleep when a 
position is closed out before the final bell.

Airlines are keeping their jets firmly on the tarmac in a bid to slash their costs, as coronavirus and a corresponding 
slump in flight demand threatens the viability of the industry.
International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) said that it expects first quarter capacity, based on available seat 
kilometres, to fall 7.5 per cent compared to 2019. IAG, which includes British Airways in its roster and is impacted 
by the restriction of travel into the US along with suspended flights to China, will cut its capacity by at least 75 per 
cent for April and May. IAG will also cut its operating expenses through a number of measures including the 
grounding of surplus aircraft and deferment of capital spending. Chief executive Willie Walsh has delayed his 
retirement.
EASYJET (EZJ), meanwhile, warned that the pandemic "could result in the grounding of the majority of the 
EASYJET fleet". The group said that aircraft groundings would significantly help to bring down its variable costs. 
Ryanair (RYA) expects to reduce its capacity for April and May by up to 80 per cent, and did not rule out grounding 
its entire fleet. It expects the majority of its fleet to be grounded over the next seven to 10 days.
The measures come as the Centre for Aviation warned that most airlines will be bankrupt by the end of May.
Over the weekend, Sky News has reported that airline Virgin Atlantic will seek a government bailout package for the 
industry worth up to £7.5bn this week. in its statement on 16 March, EASYJET observed that "European aviation 
faces a precarious future and there is no guarantee that the European airlines... will survive." The airline added that 
the industry's existence "will depend significantly on European airlines maintaining access to liquidity, including that 
enabled by governments across Europe".
Coronavirus threatens to topple airline industry TRAVEL & LEISURE
The airline groups were keen to emphasise the strength of their cash positions. "They are going to be requiring all 
of that," said Peel Hunt transport analyst Alex Paterson, who observed that in the absence of ticket sales, all that 
airlines can do now is to ground jets and minimise their expenditure. "They just won't be able to shed costs quickly 
enough... basically they're just going to burn through cash."
• While the major airlines are wellcapitalised and do not face immediate extinction, executives are staring into the 
abyss and are unable to provide financial projections, given the uncertainty of this crisis. This is an unprecedented 
situation and one that could drive ahead consolidation efforts in a bloated industry, but with no sign of coronavirus 
abating we do not view the current weakness in airline stocks as a buying opportunity.

Airline stocks were some of the biggest fallers on Monday 24 February, a day that saw mounting fears over Covid-
19 drag down the FTSE 100 index by more than 3 per cent. London-listed airlines, including International 
Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG), EASYJET (EZY) and Wizz Air (WIZZ), plunged amid a rising death toll and 
disruption in Italy, a key destination for UK travellers. A surge in infections in Northern Italy has prompted the 
closure of towns and cancellation of events, as Italy recorded four deaths and 152 cases at the start of the week, 
compared with just 17 on Friday, 20 February. Italy represents around 9 per cent of European Economic Area 
(EEA) capacity.
The news means that concerns over airlines' ability to operate are no longer limited to Asia-Pacific operators. The 
Italian disruption follows an alarming statement from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) last week, 
which forecast a $29.3bn (£22.3bn) cut to airline revenues prompted by the virus. The trade body expects airlines 
from Asia-Pacific to lose $27.8bn and those in the rest of the world $1.5bn. This last figure is now likely to rise given 
the subsequent news from Italy.
The outbreak is likely to temper airline demand from North America, which would harm IAG in particular given its 
extensive transatlantic activity. IAG shares fell 9 per cent at the start of the week. The group counts British Airways 
and Iberia among its roster of brands.
EasyJet, Wizz Air and Ryanair (RYA) are likely to be affected by travel restrictions and contractions in demand 
linked to Italian travel. Ryanair, whose shares fell by nearly 14 per cent on Monday, said all of its flights were 
currently operating normally. EasyJet and Wizz Air shares fell 17 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, while Tui 
Airlines plunge on coronavirus outbreak TRAVEL & LEISURE ; Airlines around the world are forecasting hits to 
earnings
(TUI), whose stock fell 10 per cent, said it had not been disrupted by the coronavirus thus far. Tui does not fly to 
China, while it considers Italy as mostly a summer destination. A spokesperson for Wizz Air said "there has been no 
disruption to Wizz Air flights". EASYJET did not respond to a request for comment.
The chaos wrought by coronavirus is also likely to impact a number of unlisted airline competitors, including Flybe 
and Alitalia, which are both currently in receipt of government support. Flybe's government bailout in particular has 
courted criticism from the likes of Ryanair, which has accused the British government of breaking European state 
aid rules over its bailout of Flybe.
Peel Hunt transport analyst Alex Paterson suggested that Covid-19 could serve as a "catalyst for consolidation" of 
other smaller airlines, too. He observed that it could also prompt the British and Italian governments to decide that, 
regarding their lifelines for Flybe and Alitalia, "enough is enough".
• Airlines around the world including Air New Zealand (NZE:AIR) and Air France (Fra:AF) have already cut earnings 
forecasts in response to coronavirus, and similar statements can be expected shortly from their London-listed rivals. 
But those brave enough to hold on to airline stocks could benefit from the exit of smaller airlines and a round of 
consolidation, providing another opportunity for bigger players to take capacity. For now, we think the short-term 
volatility is worth bearing and recommend holding on for that outcome.

"D o you know that you are travelling on the airline with Europe's lowest emissions…?" runs the advert, adding that 
it has "the lowest carbon emissions of any major airline" and "is committed to cutting our carbon emissions further". 
For anyone concerned about the environment, yet wishing to fly, the implication is clear. This is the obvious airline 
to choose.
There's just one problem. The claims crumble under scrutiny. Ryanair (RYA) has a history of running provocative 
and misleading adverts, of course. This one really pushes the boundaries of environmental spin.
Hardly clean and hardly green The inconvenience faced by all airlines is that theirs is a high emissions industry. 
Carbon dioxide is just one of the pollutants jet engines produce. Others include heated water vapour, nitrogen 
oxides, sulphur oxides, unburnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and soot (admittedly in smaller 
quantities). At higher altitudes, these non-CO2 gases persist longer than at ground level and have a greater (global) 
warming potential. Ethical investors already avoid shares in tobacco, alcohol and gambling companies. Funds are 
being lobbied by the more active of their members to sell out of fossil fuels. Airlines could be next.
Some time ago, The Independent newspaper ran a headline pointing out that Ryanair was "spewing out nearly as 
much CO2 as Cyprus does". That was in 2012, when it produced 7.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide. By 2018, this had 
risen to 9.9m tonnes - a growth so fast that, for the first time, a European Commission report ranked Ryanair as the 
10th largest European polluting entity. The nine above it are coal-fired power stations. So Europe's self-proclaimed 
"cleanest and greenest airline group" is, in fact, just the opposite. It pollutes more than any other European airline.
Flygskam Environmental concerns have crept up investors' agendas. Ryanair risks being in the firing line, says 
Paul Jackson ; NO FREE LUNCH
Ah, but that's not what we meant, Ryanair claimed in its response to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). 
The reference was to CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre. Ryanair's aircraft have a "higher seating density" 
(limited leg room, in other words) and a "higher passenger load factor" (filling almost every seat) than most other 
airlines. Its newer aircraft pollute less.
It produced a chart from Brighter Planet, a provider of carbon and energy calculations. This ranks Ryanair as the 
most efficient airline. The ASA wasn't buying that. What's the date of this chart? 2011. Had it not occurred to 
Ryanair that such an old survey was "of little value as substantiation for a comparison made in 2019"? And, the 
ASA went on: "Some well-known airlines did not appear on the chart, so it was not clear whether they had been 
measured." Some might pollute less.
Ryanair referred to another bar chart, this time from Eurocontrol, showing the percentage share of CO2 emissions 
and air traffic from 27 (unidentified) airlines in early 2019. Ryanair divided one bar into the other to work out that it 
must be the most efficient. The ASA replicated this. It found that some other carriers appear to have similar, if not 
lower, ratios.
The adverts were running in 10 countries across Europe. Earlier this month, the ASA required Ryanair to pull the 
ones in the UK.
Grounded At this point you might think that Ryanair's 11 non-executive directors would insist that Michael O'Leary, 
Ryanair's chief executive, corrects his company's information. Yet, go onto its website, click on the environmental 
policy and the unsubstantiated claims are still there. It trumpets that it produces 66g CO2 per passenger km, which 
apparently "is 23 per cent lower than the average of Europe's other four big airlines". Who are these four? easyJet 
(EZJ), British Airways, part of International Consolidated Airlines (IAG), Air France-KLM (Fr:AF) and Lufthansa 
(Ger:LHA). What's more, Ryanair says its target is to cut its emissions to 60g by 2030, which will widen the gap to 
30 per cent. This estimate relies on Ryanair's own calculations, and presumably on Boeing sorting out its problems 
with the 737 MAX 200s, which Ryanair has on order.
Ryanair's environmental policy commits it to address climate change, although "aviation is the most efficient form of 
mass pointto-point transport, accounting for just 2 per cent of EU man-made CO2 emissions". It's been pulled up 
about this as well. Some of its destinations named as major cities (such as Paris, Frankfurt and Barcelona) could 
land passengers in provincial airports over 50 miles away. That 2.4 per cent figure (relating to global CO2 
emissions) is often quoted, but it excludes the impact of infrastructure and further transport links. And, according to 
the 2013 IATA technology roadmap, also quoted by Ryanair, emissions are expected to increase at a remorseless 
rate. This roadmap suggests that globally a drop will only be possible from 2040 onwards, and then only provided 
that low-carbon fuels come on stream.
Mr O'Leary says that Ryanair would use these fuels if they were cost-effective, but there must first be a consensus 
on "international standards and sustainability criteria". In other words, it's up to governments and fuel suppliers. 
That may be so, but others are doing more. Virgin Atlantic is supporting a project to scale up the recycling of carbon 
from industrial waste gases to make low-carbon aviation fuel. And British Airways has coinvested in a plant to 
convert waste destined for landfill or incineration into jet and road fuel.
He also believes that Europe could cut its CO2 emissions by 10 per cent if routings were made more efficient. To 
achieve that requires a Europe-wide integrated air traffic control system. Over to governments again. But who's 
going to pay for it? Well, not Ryanair, apparently, for Mr O'Leary believes that higher aviation taxes "are not the 
answer". Ryanair expects to pay (EURO)630m in environmental taxes in its 2020 financial year, which is just 11 per 
cent of the cost of its fares. Of these, (EURO)150m will be from buying additional carbon "allowances" for polluting 
too much - exceeding the cap on its greenhouse gas emissions under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). 
The unfairness here, he says, is that ETS currently does not apply to flights to or from non-EU countries (so 
presumably Brexit will let its UK flights offthe hook). The UK catches Ryanair with (EURO)383m of Air Passenger 
Duty (APD).
Flygskam Environmental concerns have crept up investors' agendas. Ryanair risks being in the firing line, says 
Paul Jackson ; NO FREE LUNCH
The push to make polluters pay Mr O'Leary, no doubt, welcomes the government's APD review (announced as part 
of the Flybe bail-out), for he argues that such taxes "disproportionately affect regional/peripheral economies that 
rely heavily on air connectivity to maintain tourism and growth". He also claims that they deliver no environmental 
benefits and favour inefficient airlines, but then he's renowned for being provocative.
Some say that APD needs to be higher. It's a proxy for a tax on aviation fuel (which, yes, is untaxed). Julian 
Allwood, professor of engineering and the environment at Cambridge University, estimates that "taxing aircraft fuel 
at the level of the UK's current road fuel tax… would make flights up to four times more expensive". Professor 
Allwood is part of a multi-university group, whose report 'Absolute Zero' concludes that there are only three ways for 
airlines to achieve their target of net zero carbon by 2050: "Invent new electric aircraft, change the fuels in existing 
aircraft or take emissions out of the air." The aviation industry is pinning its hopes on the first two; the academics 
see this as unrealistic. The only solution, they say, is to cut back on the number of flights, or better still, to stop 
flying. In short, that 2050 zero-carbon target needs to be pursued, but it's an empty promise.
Ryanair also argues that environmental taxes penalise the lower paid. A perspective on this is provided by the 
European Aviation Safety Agency. Based on a typical twoengine jet during a one-hour flight with 150 passengers, it 
says that every kilogram of aviation fuel burned churns out three kilograms of CO2. Whether passengers are highly 
paid or poorly paid, the pollution is the same.
Carbon offsets Like most airlines, Ryanair enables customers to donate conscience money to offset the 
environmental impact of their flight; 98 per cent haven't bothered. Over the past two years, 2 per cent have donated 
(EURO)2.5m. This has been spent on buying cooking stoves in Uganda, helping to restore a Portuguese forest 
habitat, on extending a native Irish wood… and on studying whales and dolphins offthe Irish coast. This last one is 
a worthy cause, but Ryanair has yet to explain how it offsets its carbon footprint.
Contrast this with the £25m a year that easyJet spends on its sustainable travel policy. Forget voluntary 
contributions. EasyJet pays them for everybody and claims that it's the first major airline to do so. "We know carbon 
offsetting is not perfect, but right now we believe it's the best way to address the carbon emitted from flying," it says. 
Its money goes to projects that meet internationally recognised carbon-offsetting accreditation. But it stresses that 
its primary aim is to reduce emissions per passenger. Like most airlines, it aims to do this by investing in larger, 
quieter aircraft and filling them more to capacity. And to seek less-polluting take-offand landing processes. Already, 
many planes now taxi on one engine, for example.
Inconvenient truths David Bonderman has been chairing Ryanair for over 23 years. He's due to be succeeded by a 
fellow nonexecutive, Stan McCarthy, this summer. The hope must be that Mr McCarthy tightens the board's 
attitudes towards its environmental, social and governance responsibilities. The directors' challenge will be to tame 
Mr O'Leary's apparent delight in courting controversy for the sake of generating publicity. They could start by 
insisting that the ASA's "missing airlines" are included when Ryanair compares itself to others. Wizz Air (WIZZ), 
now worth over £3bn, has a similar operating model to Ryanair, and competes with it on some routes, although its 
focus is eastern Europe. Last month, it announced that its CO2 emissions for the whole of 2019 averaged 57.3g per 
passenger kilometre. Now, what was Ryanair's again? 66g. What's more, Wizz Air's emissions are already almost 5 
per cent lower than Ryanair's target of 60g for 2030. Some might conclude that Ryanair is guilty of believing its own 
publicity about its pollution record. Compared with Wizz Air, it appears to be at least 10 years behind the curve.
'Carbon dioxide is just one of the pollutants jet engines produce. Others include heated water vapour, nitrogen 
oxides, sulphur oxides, unburnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and soot' ;  ;

The coronavirus - a respiratory disease originating from China's Wuhan province that has now claimed more than 
100 lives - has sent shockwaves through global markets, threatening supply chains and depressing stocks in the 
travel and luxury sectors. The outbreak has evoked memories of the Sars epidemic in the early 2000s, which 
hammered inbound Chinese tourism and retail. For now, investors are being cautioned to stick with their portfolio 
strategies, although a move to a more defensive allocation may soon be advisable.
At the time of writing, major indices had started to recover losses after a fraught start to the week. The Stoxx 600 
index, which follows Europe's 600 largest companies, has edged upwards after a loss of 2.3 per cent on 27 January 
- its biggest drop since October 2019. The FTSE 100 lost 2.5 per cent on Monday. The price of brent crude oil, the 
international benchmark, fell to $59 a barrel, having soared through $70 earlier this month during the Iran crisis. 
Chinese markets remain closed.
Airline stocks with exposure to China have taken a battering since the severity of coronavirus became clearer. 
International Consolidated Airlines (IAG), which has exposure of less than 3 per cent to China based on capacity, 
according to UBS estimates, has seen its shares drop more than 6 per cent since the start of the week. It has 8 per 
cent exposure to the Asia Pacific region on this basis. In response to the outbreak, IAG's British Airways marque 
has offered customers due to travel to or from China until 23 February the option to receive a refund or re-book their 
flights. "We will continue to closely monitor the situation," a spokesperson said.
The group is less vulnerable than Air France-KLM (Fra:AF) and Lufthansa (Ger:LHA), which both have 7 per cent 
exposure to China. Short-haul airlines have reacted less markedly to the virus owing to their lack of activity in Asia, 
Coronavirus spread rattles markets Fears over the rapidly spreading virus have taken their toll on the travel and 
luxury sectors
although Asian travellers coming to Europe and consumer fears over air travel are likely to have driven Ryanair's 
(RYA) shares down by 3 per cent this week.
Hotel and travel businesses, such as InterContinental Hotels (IHG), have also sustained share price losses 
following the coronavirus outbreak. Of IHG's 836,541 hotel rooms, 14 per cent are located in Greater China, 
according to its latest annual report, and IHG is building its presence in the region with its Holiday Inn Express and 
EVEN brands. Its shares dropped more than 6 per cent from the start of the week.
Luxury companies have also suffered as fear over the spread of the virus has taken hold. China is a key market for 
the sector, constituting 35 per cent of its sales and more than 70 per cent of its growth, according to analysts at 
Morgan Stanley. The sector is also vulnerable to the knock-on impact of a slowdown in the travel industry. Morgan 
Stanley estimates that more than half of total luxury purchases made by Chinese nationals happen outside of 
Mainland China.
UK-listed Burberry (BRBY) is believed to be one of the companies most likely to be affected by the outbreak. 
Analysts at RBC Capital Markets estimate the group makes 24 per cent of its revenues in China, and a further 15 
per cent from offshore Chinese consumption, behind jeweller Richemont and watchmaker Swatch. LVMH (FR:MC) 
is less exposed, but only a little, with onshore and offshore sales accounting for 17 per cent and 15 per cent, 
respectively.
The Sars outbreak in 2003 led to a 20 per cent reduction in international travel from China, with a far smaller impact 
on domestic travel. However, RBC said the speed of transmission and citywide shutdowns in China meant "the 
impact is likely to be felt more equally across domestic and international traveller flows".
Sharp market falls will leave some investors questioning whether to row back from exposed equities and adopt a 
more defensive portfolio. Difficulties in obtaining live information on the outbreak from the Chinese authorities have 
made it more difficult for markets to track the virus. "An average incubation period of seven days makes it difficult to 
contain the spreading," observed JPMorgan analysts, who added that an absence of fever symptoms in some 
cases has further complicated efforts to control the outbreak.
Nigel Green, chief executive of financial advisory firm deVere Group, warned most investors against knee-jerk 
reactions. "History teaches us that most issues of this kind have a short-term impact on stock markets," he said. But 
Mr Green cautioned that an escalation in the crisis and higher casualty rates might force investors to adopt a more 
defensive approach.
"The health scare over the coronavirus outbreak is a serious concern," JPMorgan analysts commented, "but we 
note past pandemics didn't typically lead to sustained selling."
Comparisons with Sars (and from some quarters, the 1918 Spanish influenza, which killed between 3 and 5 per 
cent of the world's population) are inevitable and informative. It's worth remembering, however, that global markets 
have shown an increasing resistance to so-called 'Black Swan' events such as this month's US-Iran flare-up, with 
indices settling after a short period of volatility. Coronavirus will hinder the progress of investors looking for short-
term gains, but we think it unwise to exit stocks because of the outbreak.

Airline bosses slam Flybe government rescue The government has agreed to defer the airline's air passenger 
duty obligations

Airline chiefs have accused the UK government of misusing taxpayer funds and flouting European Union (EU) state 
aid rules, after it agreed a rescue package with the owners of struggling airline Flybe.
The Treasury, the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy 
(BEIS) struck a deal with Connect Airways earlier this month. The government's decision to defer Flybe's obligation 
to collect air passenger duty (APD) from its customers, under a 'time to pay' arrangement for a debt of up to £10m, 
has enraged competitors.
Connect Airways, a consortium made up of logistics business Stobart Group (STOB), airline Virgin Atlantic and US 
investment fund Cyrus Capital Partners, will pay £30m into Flybe over the coming months (Stobart has said that it 
will commit up to £9m). The group gained control of Flybe in July 2019 and to date has invested £110m in the 
airline.
After it was announced that Flybe's near-term future had been secured, Ryanair (RYA) chief executive Michael 
O'Leary wrote to Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid accusing the government of distorting fair competition 
between airlines with a package that "clearly constitutes illegal state aid".
Under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, as part of the UK's exit from the European Union, the UK is obliged 
to comply with EU competition and state aid rules. International Consolidated Airlines (IAG), which owns Virgin 
Atlantic rival British Airways, has submitted a complaint to the EU Competition directorate "about the state aid that 
the UK government has granted to Flybe", according to a spokesperson.
Airline bosses slam Flybe government rescue The government has agreed to defer the airline's air passenger 
duty obligations
The UK government has denied breaking state aid rules. It observed that there were more than 700,000 'time to 
pay' arrangements in place during 2018-19, which have helped businesses facing short-term difficulties in meeting 
their tax obligations by spreading their payments. Flybe has not published financial results since being taken over 
by Connect Airways. The airline put itself up for sale in November 2018, before receiving an offer from the 
consortium in January 2019. Cyrus Capital owns 40 per cent of Flybe, while Virgin and Stobart both own 30 per 
cent. Flybe is set to be rebranded as 'Virgin Connect'.
Stobart targets regulator The takeover was opposed by Flybe's largest shareholder, Hosking Partners, which 
sought to oust thenchairman Simon Laffin over the sale and the decline in Flybe's value. The deal also ran into 
regulatory difficulties with the European Commission, which Stobart has subsequently blamed for delaying 
Connect's plans to revive the airline. "This resulted in a situation in which a further injection of funds is required to 
ensure continued flying," it said on 16 January.
With 8.3m seats, the airline accounted for 29 per cent of the UK's 28.8m domestic scheduled airline seat capacity in 
2019. This made it the UK's second-largest domestic operator, behind EASYJET (EZJ) and ahead of British 
Airways. Last year, Flybe confirmed plans to expand its presence at London Southend Airport, which is owned by 
Stobart.
"A blatant misuse of public funds" This month, Sky News reported that the airline had entered crisis talks with the 
government in a bid to secure financing. The resolution includes a deferment in collecting APD, an environmental 
tax laid against flights from UK airports, which will take place on a monthly basis up to the value of £10m. This 
proposal has incensed airline executives.
The government has announced reviews of APD and 'regional connectivity'. At £13 per flight, the tax is one of the 
highest of its kind in the world. As of 2019, Germany had an air passenger tax of (EURO)7.50, while Austria levied 
a tax of just (EURO)3.50, according to Ryanair's 2019 annual report.
Were Flybe to fail, the likes of Ryanair, EASYJET and British Airways would be ready to absorb its flights, Mr 
O'Leary at Ryanair told the chancellor in a letter dated 16 January. Mr O'Leary demanded the details of government 
support offered to Flybe, and asked for confirmation that "this APD holiday will now be extended to all other 
competitor airlines in the UK".
Ryanair's chief executive issued the chancellor with a seven-day ultimatum for the confirmation of these facts. 
Failure to receive these details will result in the airline suing the British government for breach of UK and EU 
competition law and the breach of state aid rules. The treasury declined to comment on Mr O'Leary's letter.
EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren is also opposed to the deal. "We do not support state funding of carriers," 
he said. "Taxpayers should not be used to bail out individual companies especially when they are backed by well-
funded businesses," he added.
A Wizz Air (WIZZ) spokesperson said subsidies "contradict fair competition".
Mr Lundgren welcomed the government's APD review, observing that the tax "provides no incentives for airlines or 
passengers to improve the carbon efficiency of their flying" and "simply acts as a revenue raiser".
IAG filed a complaint with the European Commission on 20 January. The airline group declined to disclose details 
of its submission. The group counts British Airways in its airline roster, which is a competitor to both Flybe and one 
of its co-owners, Virgin Atlantic.
"Prior to the acquisition of Flybe by the consortium, which includes Virgin/Delta, Flybe argued for taxpayers to fund 
its operations by subsidising regional routes," departing IAG chief executive Willie Walsh commented.
"Virgin/Delta now want the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their mismanagement of the airline," he added. "This is a 
blatant misuse of public funds."
Airline bosses slam Flybe government rescue The government has agreed to defer the airline's air passenger 
duty obligations
A European Commission spokesperson said: "We stand ready to discuss with the UK the compatibility of proposed 
public measures with EU state aid rules."
A Flybe statement confirmed that the airline had agreed a payment plan with HMRC, adding that "this agreement 
will only last a matter of months before all taxes and duties are paid in full".
"This is a standard time-to-pay arrangement with HMRC that any business in financial difficulties may use."
APD is unsustainable The government's willingness to sustain Flybe appears to sit within its commitment to "level 
up" the UK's cities and regions. While the airline has struggled, it remains a critical component of the country's 
regional connectivity, providing over half of domestic seats outside London.
Canaccord Genuity analysts said that "a bankruptcy of Flybe would... have had a disastrous effect on a wide range 
of cities, communities and regions in the UK, which would have been starved of airline transport connections".
The analysts argued that "the arguably unsustainable high level of domestic APD has been a prime factor in Flybe's 
financial struggles". The £26 levied on a return domestic flight can be equivalent to almost half of Flybe's initial 
promotional fares. The tax came into effect in 1994, and last year was forecast to raise £3.7bn over the 2018-19 
period.
Of IAG's (EURO)3.15bn (£2.64bn) overall tax bill for its 2018 full year, it spent (EURO)885m on UK APD. Airlines in 
Europe don't pay a duty on fuel, although a tax of (EURO)330 per thousand litres of fuel has been touted, which 
would increase ticket prices on average by around 10 per cent.
APD has been criticised for disproportionately impacting regional travel, owing to the fact that it is levied on both 
legs of a return journey. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said that a benefit of Brexit 
would be the ability to cut or remove APD on regional travel. "Levying £26 in tax when - in the case of Flybe - the 
average fare is £52 - is not sustainable when so many other costs on airlines are increasing."
"APD is not and never has been an environmental tax," he added. "It has no bearing on the ability of the aviation 
industry to decarbonise and achieve net zero emissions by 2050."
Peel Hunt transport analyst Alex Paterson dismissed the possibility of any interest from the UK's quoted airlines in 
acquiring Flybe. He expressed surprise at the government's offer to defer Flybe's APD obligations. "That's not the 
sort of thing that the British government has tended to do historically," he said.
"Clearly they've got to be careful not to make it look like they're favouring Flybe over anybody else," he added. "If 
you defer that payment, you are favouring them, because nobody else is getting those terms."
• The government and Flybe have kept frustratingly tight-lipped over the details of the rescue deal, which has only 
served to intensify criticism from the UK's airline chiefs. Competitors' frustrations are understandable, particularly 
given the momentum they gained from absorbing the capacity of nowdefunct Thomas Cook last year.
It can reasonably be argued that APD is now counterproductive in the movement towards alternative fuels, making 
it more difficult for airlines to invest in battery technologies and biofuels. But in the current climate of 'Flugscham' 
(one's guilt over travelling by air) and the possibility of a new European fuel levy, it seems unlikely that the UK 
government will remove the tax and open itself up to criticism over its attitude towards the environment. Perhaps it 
will follow the cue of the German government and instead invest in other transport infrastructure, in a bid to keep 
travellers on the ground.

What we said: Sell When: 14 February 2019 Price: 1,120¢ Share price change to date: +43% Alate flurry of 
Christmas and New Year bookings prompted a forecast upgrade from Ryanair (RYA). Forward bookings for 
January to April are 1 per cent ahead of this point last year, which will drive up average fares for the airline's fourth 
quarter and push full-year bookings up to 154m, above a previous forecast of 153m. The airline has lifted its fullyear 
guidance for post-tax profits accordingly to a range of (EURO)950m-(EURO)1.15bn (£814m-£899m) from 
(EURO)800m-(EURO)900m. It expects to land around the mid-point of this new range.
Ryanair's Austrian subsidiary, Laudamotion, "continues to underperform", owing to heavy price competition in 
Germany and Austria. Ryanair expects the subsidiary's net loss for the year to grow to around (EURO)90m, above 
previously expected losses of less than (EURO)80m.
Ryanair trimmed guidance twice towards the end of last year as the Boeing 737 Max debacle dragged on. However, 
with capacity coming out of the industry, Ryanair may be well-poised to scoop up additional bookings and extend its 
recent momentum. Hold at 1,618¢. AJ Hold

At 5.20am on the day of easyJet's (EZJ) latest results announcement, flight EJU5841 from Berlin to Vienna took off, 
marking the first step towards the budget airline offsetting all of its carbon emissions, in a move that will improve its 
environmental credentials without breaking the bank.
p Share price 1,333p 1400 1200 1000 800 At a cost of £25m for the coming year, the move won't have much of an 
impact on profitability, although it still represents 11 per cent of the funds given over to dividends in FY2019. While 
easyJet's management admits it is an "interim measure", the impact of carbon offset over the long haul is 
impossible to gauge at this point.
2018 2019 Sales growth once again fell shy of capacity expansion, with top-line growth behind the 10.3 per cent 
capacity increase. Deteriorating consumer confidence and falling discretionary spending were to blame for a 1.8 per 
cent drop in revenue per seat, although self-help initiatives such as the group's late-yield pricing initiative and the 
positive impact of industrial action at British Airways and Ryanair (RYA) helped to mitigate the cyclical decline.
The deterioration occurred in the first half of the year, with revenue-per-seat growth restored to 0.8 per cent in the 
latter period. Lower profits had a knock-on effect on return on capital employed, causing it to fall 320 basis points 
from its restated level of 14.6 per cent to just 11.4 per cent. As flagged in October's trading update, load factor - 
essentially the utilisation of the group's airlines - fell 1.4 percentage points to 91.5 per cent. Again, mitigating 
initiatives linked to product and pricing, along with improved conversion rates, help to shore up trading performance 
in the face of hardening markets.
Management has reported that bookings are ahead of last year - albeit against a weak comparator - and is guiding 
for capacity growth at the lower end of its previous 3-8 per cent range, while constant currency revenue per seat is 
slated for low-to-mid singledigit growth. Bloomberg consensus forecasts point to adjusted EPS of 92.3p for the year 
to September 2020, up from 88.7p in FY2019.

Faltering consumer confidence has constrained EASYJET's growth in the year, but for all the benefits of 
management's focus on improved costs and pricing, it's hard to ignore the 25 per cent cut to the dividend, 
particularly with more funds earmarked for carbon offsets. TD Hold

p Share price 117p S210 180 150 tobart Group (STOB) is prioritising investment in two core businesses, the 
London Southend Airport and Stobart Energy, and has suspended its dividend in order to free up capital for future 
expenditure.
120 90 2018 2019 Management is focusing on building partnerships with the likes of easyJet (EZY) and Ryanair 
(RYA) as it chases a target of 5m passengers at Southend in the financial year to February 2023. Chief executive 
Warwick Brady said that the dividend, which could be reintroduced following the attainment of goals relating to the 
airport and energy, would be paid under a "mechanistic policy" linked to profits, rather than pence per share. The 
group expects to invest in airport infrastructure over three years, spending between £40m and £60m.
Stobart Energy's underlying cash profits increased by more than a third over the period to £11.7m, while it also 
expects to recover significant costs resulting from a power outage at the Tilbury Green Power Plant that took place 
from April until mid-October. Stobart expects to invest £10m in energy as part of its restructure.
House broker Cantor Fitzgerald forecasts full-year 2020 cash profits and a loss per share of £20.1m and 1.4p, 
respectively, improving to £34.7m and earnings per share of 2.2p in 2021.
Stobart Group's shares edged down by 5 per cent following this announcement. But we think there is merit in 
prioritising value creation through investing in the group's higher-growth areas, rather than maintaining short-term 
shareholder reward (although last year's full dividend would have yielded nearly 8 per cent on today's share price). 
We suggest waiting to see if the investment translates into returns. AJ Hold Ord Price: 117p Market Value: £438m

Ryanair (RYA) has cut the target range for its full-year post-tax profits, with Boeing 737 Max disruption, rising fuel 
costs and spiralling losses in the airline's Lauda outfit expected to weigh on earnings.
In July, Ryanair cut the number of 737 Max-200 jets it expected to receive for the summer of 2020 from 58 to 30. 
The planes remain grounded after two software-related crashes, and Ryanair has now cut this further to 20 aircraft. 
Subject to regulatory approval, the airline expects to receive the planes in March or April, although it caveated that 
"the risk of further delay is rising". The planes, which are more fuel-efficient, were expected to help Ryanair achieve 
cost savings - these will not now be achieved until 2021.
Full-year losses for Ryanair's Lauda brand will exceed expectations, which Ryanair attributed to overcapacity in 
Austria and Germany. Ryanair also envisages a (EURO)450m (£389m) rise in its fuel bill. The airline has narrowed 
its full-year guidance for post-tax profits accordingly to a new range of (EURO)800m-(EURO)900m, from a previous 
range of (EURO)750m to (EURO)950m.
Ryanair struck a cautious tone in its half-year report, decrying the "unreliable optimism of some competitors". The 
airline continues to be hamstrung by its Boeing order, and says that growth in passenger traffic is vulnerable to 
market uncertainty, including a no-deal Brexit. We see no significant catalysts for share price growth that would 
tempt us to upgrade our rating. Sell at (EURO)13.31. AJ

Airlines (IAG) has agreed to buy Spanish airline Air Europa for (EURO)1bn, in an attempt to boost the profile of the 
airline group's Madrid hub and tap into the South American market. The Air Europa brand will be retained, and the 
airline will sit within IAG's Iberia outfit. The acquisition will boost IAG's exposure to the US, the Caribbean and Latin 
America.

forecasts full-year 2019 earnings per share of 1.1p, rising to 1.15p in 2020.
This deal represents a surprising show of confidence on the same day that Ryanair (RYA) trimmed its own 
guidance and decried "the unreliable optimism of some competitors". The industry has been crying out for 
consolidation, and IAG has the firepower to conduct this deal. But IAG's difficulties with BA strike action, rising fuel 
costs across the industry and oversupply in some geographies leave us unwilling to upgrade. Sell at 549p. AJ

Afull-year trading update from Hollywood Bowl (BOWL) for the 12 months to September was followed by multiple 
upgrades to sales and profit expectations. Analysts at Peel Hunt increased full-year pre-tax profit expectations for 
2019 and 2020 by 4 per cent and 2 per cent respectively, while N+1 Singer analysts upgraded 2020 pre-tax profits 
by 1 per cent. At Shore Capital, analysts increased 2019 revenue and pre-tax profit estimates by £2m and £0.6m to 
£130m and £26.5m, respectively.
Total revenue for the year to September 2019 is up 7.7 per cent, or 5.5 on a like-forlike basis. Pre-tax profits are 
expected to be up more than 10 per cent, ahead of market expectations. Chief executive Stephen Burns indicated 
positive like-for-like growth at all of the group's divisions.
Continued strong cash generation has prompted management to consider returning additional capital to 
shareholders, with analysts expecting this to come in the form of a special dividend of around 4.3p. The actual 
figure will be given at Hollywood Bowl's fullyear results announcement in December. The company's ongoing 
investment programme in its locations appears to be paying off, as customers continue to spend more when they're 
there. The shares are up nearly a fifth over the past 12 months and now trade at 232p. JF Buy TRAVEL &

+2% Investors in airlines are often sensitive to any perceived lag between passenger and capacity growth. This was 
a key cause of the significant slide in EASYJET's (EZJ) share price following a trading update. While the number of 
passengers carried increased by 8.6 per cent, this did not keep pace with a 10.3 per cent increase in capacity, 
leading to a 1.4 percentage point decline in load factor to 91.5 per cent.
Hollywood Bowl update spurs analyst upgrades TRAVEL & LEISURE HOLLYWOOD BOWL (BOWL)
Strikes at British Airways and Ryanair (RYA) were to the benefit of EASYJET in its second half. This, along with 
"self-help initiatives", mean that this year's headline pre-tax profit is expected to be between £420m and £430m, 
towards the upper end of previous guidance of between £400m and £440m.
So far, forward bookings for the first quarter of the 2020 financial year are in line with this time last year. Capacity 
growth for the full 2020 financial year is expected to be at the lower end of the historic range, which seems prudent 
given the current pressure on load factor. At 1,092p, buy. JF Buy CHEMICALS TREATT (TET) What we said: Buy 
When: 28 February 2019 Price: 440p Share price change to date: -8% Low prices for citrus products continue to 
weigh on Treatt (TET). The ingredients maker expects to report a 1 per cent increase in revenue to £113m for its 
financial year to September 2019, or a decrease of 2 per cent at constant currency due to foreign exchange 
headwinds. Sales growth was hurt by a "very significant fall in certain citrus raw materials prices". But growth in 
other products such as tea, health and wellness, and fruit and vegetables, helped to offset this decline at group 
level, with non-citrus sales up 16 per cent. Natural flavourings now represent around 80 per cent of Treatt's 
portfolio, although the remaining synthetic flavour and fragrance market saw "healthy" growth of 16 per cent.
Treatt still expects pre-tax profit before exceptional items to be in line with expectations. The company ended the 
year with a cash balance of £15.8m - a net inflow for the year of £5.8m. We think increasing demand for low-calorie 
offerings should continue to drive demand for Treatt's products over the long term. At 407p, buy. JF Buy 
AUTOMOBILES & PARTS AA (AA.) What we said: Sell When: 30 May 2019 Price: 58.8p Share price change to 
date: -14% A Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) market study into general insurance pricing practices has been a 
source of uncertainty hanging over AA (AA.). With an interim report concluding that UK home and motor 
policyholders are overpaying by around £1.2bn a year, news that the regulator is mulling intervention sent the 
shares down by more than 4 per cent.
The FCA is considering cracking down on practices that discourage customers from switching providers and 
banning so-called 'loyalty penalties'. The final report is due in early 2020.
The AA was probably hoping that progress in its half-year results would help restore investor confidence. But the 
FCA looks set to introduce pricing reforms that could impact both the insurance and roadside assistance divisions. 
This is without mentioning the mountainous £2.7bn of net debt. At 50.5p, sell. NK Sell INVESTMENT SERVICES 
CMC MARKETS (CMCX) What we said: Sell When: 11 July 2019 Price: 95.6p Share price change to date: +24% 
CMC Markets (CMCX) expects net operating income to exceed £170m in its year to March 2020, as the spread-
betting firm eyes a possible rebound after regulatory changes caused its revenues and profits to crash last year. 
The estimate was unveiled in a first-half trading update, which suggested income from the contracts for difference 
(CFD) business would be "only slightly down" on the first half of FY2019, when the new rules were introduced.
Active client numbers fell, and operating costs before remuneration are expected to rise, although CMC's higher 
retention of a greater proportion of client income means CFD "net trading revenue" should hit £85m for the period, 
up from £63m in the first half of FY2019. At its current growth rate, we reckon the stockbroking division should 
contribute around £34m of the upgraded revenue forecast, which suggests CMC expects client income from the 
CFD business to moderate in the second half. We still think Peel Hunt's adjusted pre-tax profit forecast of £25.1m 
looks overly bullish. Sell at 119p. AN Sell

Body
On Monday, Brent crude futures recorded their biggest one-day spike on record, after a weekend drone strike on a 
Saudi Aramco refinery took out up to 5 per cent of global daily oil supplies. Responsibility for the strike was claimed 
by Houthi militia, currently at war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen, which quickly led to US finger-pointing at Iran, and 
inflamed rhetoric from Tehran in response.
The Saudis have said it could be weeks until production is fully restored, which suggests the spike is unlikely to 
unwind this month. But an otherwise stable commodity market has suddenly entered unpredictable territory, and 
over an uncertain time frame. As such, it's unwise and impossible to anticipate with any confidence the broader 
implications for equity markets and asset prices.
Nonetheless, investors should be mindful of several important knock-on effects. The first is what even a single 
quarter of markedly higher energy prices might do to second-half earnings of corporates for whom oil is a major 
overhead. Predictably, airlines including EASYJET (EZJ) and Ryanair (RYA), as well as mining and manufacturing 
stocks, fell following the weekend's news. Hedging can help, but for some big oil consumers sharp price 
movements can be the difference between a profit and a loss. The second is the broader effect on the global 
economy, and the US economy in particular. As we recently noted, discussion of the yield curve's recent inversion, 
and its portents for an American recession, have largely failed to mention the cost of energy. That's probably an 
error, given that US recessions since the 1970s have followed sharp rises in crude prices. So while we shouldn't 
overplay the prospects of inflation just yet, the possibility of rising prices at the pump has suddenly increased, and is 
far more likely to impact sentiment in the world's largest consumer economy than the yield on 10-year treasury 
bonds. Again, a higher risk of recession is bad for stocks.
Shock and awe; The weekend's drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities are a reminder that geopolitics can still 
shock markets
Third, the prospects for a listing of Saudi Aramco have probably dimmed. For three years, Saudi Crown Prince 
Mohammed bin Salman has touted the sale of shares as a key plank of his economic diversification strategy. And 
the longer markets waited for a prospectus to land, the louder the doubters' voices have become. But in recent 
weeks, personnel changes in the upper echelons of the Kingdom and reports of investment bank beauty parades 
have revived expectations that the largest initial public offering in history might indeed take place.
Any pretence that Aramco's assets are divisible from the Saudi state must now be dropped. So long as oil powers 
the global economy, there will be some investors keen for exposure to the producer's cost profile, enormous 
reserves and generous dividends. But the drone strike underlines a core part of the bear case: that Aramco's asset 
base is entirely concentrated in and operated by a state that is currently at war, and becoming increasingly drawn 
into an unpredictable conflict with Iran.
Finally, the episode is a reminder that in an era of a say-anything statesman and fraying international diplomacy, 
geopolitics can still provide severe market shocks. Arguably, with respect to oil markets, a degree of complacency 
had set in. Because while this latest attack is unprecedented in its devastation to shortterm production, the mining 
of Saudi tankers in recent months showed that regional oil production was in play. Prices barely budged, and even 
dropped last week on the news that Donald Trump had fired national security adviser and renowned Iran hawk John 
Bolton, implying that oil's risk premium was thinning.
In the event, it seems that a major hit to supply was the only thing to wake the market up to the Gulf's increasingly 
volatile dynamics. But it is also clear that a new chapter has just begun. The audacity of the attack on the world's 
largest oil refinery has highlighted the fragility of Saudi supplies, long thought of as dependable. In this conflict, flash 
points are sudden, and aggression is asymmetric. Consequently, and bereft of mediating powers in the region, 
escalation feels the more likely course. As for the oil price, analysts suggest the US and 'Opec-plus' member 
Russia could quickly fill gaps in supply, although this sounds speculative, at least until there is greater clarity on the 
size of those gaps. For equity investors, the development is yet another reason to feel nervy - unless you have the 
stomach or war games-like insight to trade oil stocks in the short term.

JULIA FAURSCHOU International Consolidated Airlines' (IAG) woes were exacerbated after British Airways pilots 
began a two-day strike, forcing the airline to cancel almost all the 1,700 flights it was scheduled to operate over 
those days. The 4,000 pilots involved in the strike believe that profits have not been shared fairly with employees, 
claiming that managers have received all the benefits, and in turn are demanding higher pay and better conditions. 
This comes at a time when airlines are grappling with rising costs across the sector.
Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' union British Airlines Pilots Association (BALPA), claims that the 
company's management is "refusing to negotiate" with pilots despite having made a "fair, reasonable and affordable 
claim for pay and benefit". Balpa's latest proposal would cost British Airways less than £5m more than that 
previously offered by the airline, the union said, while each day of strike action is estimated to cost the airline 
around £40m. If an agreement is not reached, pilots will strike for a third day on 27 September.
A spokesperson for British Airways said the average captain earns £167,000 a year plus £16,000 in flying 
allowances on top of basic pay. British Airways offered an increase in pay of 11.5 per cent over three years, plus a 
one-off payment in 2019 of 1 per cent. If pilots accepted the offer, it would take them to over £200,000 a year, when 
£167,000 is already five times the UK average salary.
Parent company IAG is already facing a number of cost headwinds. Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges 
increased by a fifth during the first half of the current financial year to (EURO)2.94bn (£2.68bn), while non-fuel costs 
per available seat kilometre increased by 1.2 per cent to (EURO)4.93. Overall, total expenditure on operations 
increased by 10.3 per cent to just under (EURO)11bn. If current fuel and exchange rates persist, then 2019's 
operating profit before exceptional items is expected to be flat on that generated in 2018.
BA pilots strike over pay and conditions Shares in parent company IAG fell as two days of strike action began
British Airways is not the only airline struggling with pay disputes. Pilots at Ryanair 'The 4,000 pilots involved in the 
strike believe that profits have not been shared fairly with employees' (RYA) went on strike in August, with further 
walkout dates scheduled through September, as they seek "the same kind of policies and agreements that exist in 
other airlines", taking issue with pensions, loss of licence insurance, maternity benefits, allowances, and pushing for 
harmonised pay across the UK.
• The estimated £40m strike cost to British Airways per day is not substantial for IAG, which generated pre-tax 
profits of (EURO)3.49bn during 2018 on revenue of (EURO)24.4bn. What could be more damaging is the effect on 
the airline's reputation, at a time when customer perception is crucial in an increasingly competitive industry. This 
has already been damaged, most recently when IAG received the largest-ever fine of £183m from the UK 
Information Commissioner's Office for customer-data theft and the resulting breach of data-protection regulations. 
Margins have been on the decline, and the dividend look unlikely to be sustained by the company's cash flows. At 
425p, sell.

Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg's yacht journey across the Atlantic to attend the Climate Action Summit in 
New York has attracted admiration and admonition in equal measure. Personally, I can't help but admire her brave 
gesture - I for one wouldn't fancy a fortnight on the open ocean with only a bucket for relief. I would have been more 
impressed had she followed in the footsteps of Thor Heyerdahl and built her own Kon-Tiki out of reeds, but as PR 
stunts go it's still a pretty spectacular feat.
But stunt it is, because, as her many critics would argue, £4m carbonfibre racing yachts are not a method of 
transport most of us wishing to head to the States can choose. To achieve the near-immediate elimination of carbon 
emissions Ms Thunberg and protest organisations such as Extinction Rebellion want the only real solution would be 
for most of us to stop travelling altogether. Given humanity's ever-irrepressible desire to explore, they are fighting a 
losing battle - and a potentially economically catastrophic one at that. According to figures from the World Travel 
and Tourism council, the global travel industry grew 3.9 per cent last year to be worth $8.8 trillion, creating 319m 
jobs and accounting for over a tenth of global GDP. Air passenger journeys taken in 2018 climbed nearly 7 per cent 
to 4.4bn, the highest level on record, set to be topped again in 2019. Mankind just won't sit still.
'Air passenger journeys taken in 2018 climbed nearly 7 per cent to 4.4bn' None of this is to say that travellers aren't 
starting to think more deeply about the environmental cost of their holidaymaking. Demand for socially-responsible 
travel is rising, among millennial holidaymakers in particular, and airlines and tour operators are making 
increasingly loud public commitments to reduce the impact of their industry - although having made it onto the EU 
Transport & Environment group's top 10 polluters list, Ryanair's claim to be Europe's greenest airline stretches the 
imagination somewhat. That said, commercial airliners today are twice as fuel efficient as they were 50 years ago 
and, as we explore in this week's cover feature, Boeing and Airbus are making huge investments in the next 
generation of clean aircraft - possibly one day even electrically powered ones.
THE EDITOR On the move
Yet despite near-constant growth, one thing that has not proved especially sustainable when it comes to the travel 
industry has been profits - whether the result of the expensive engineering troubles seen at Boeing and Rolls-
Royce, or an inability to cope with the fierce competition unlocked by the internet, of which Thomas Cook is the 
latest victim (its rescue financing will all but wipe out shareholders). You will find one surprising exception, however, 
on page 36 of this magazine: WH Smith, whose travel business is still driving the group's profits and share price 
higher. Travellers, it seems, will always pay anything for chocolate.

Ryanair (RYA) will reduce its scheduled aircraft for the summer of 2020 from 58 to 30 jets, in anticipation of delays 
to the delivery of its Boeing 737 Max jets. The airline has 135 737 Max 200 jets on order with options for a further 
75 planes. The Max is currently grounded worldwide after two software-related crashes.
Ryanair hopes to see the jet return to service around September. But chief executive Michael O'Leary said the 
company believes it "prudent to plan for that date to slip by some months, possibly as late as December". Ryanair 
hopes to receive its planes sometime between January and February. As the airline can only take delivery of 
between six and eight new aircraft each month, its summer schedule will be based on 30 aircraft deliveries up to 
end of May 2020.
The downward revision will see Ryanair's summer 2020 growth rate drop from 7 per cent to 3 per cent, meaning 
that full-year traffic growth for the year to March 2021 will be cut from 162m passengers to around 157m. Mr 
O'Leary said the airline would work with Boeing and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to recover 
these delivery delays during the winter of 2020.
Broker Berenberg expects full-year 2020 operating profit to drop to £948m from £1.19bn in 2019. Berenberg 
analysts think there is a high likelihood of another Ryanair profit warning, following two warnings in four months up

Like-for-like sales growth in Burberry's first quarter to the end of June came in at 4 per cent, which was about 
double what analysts had expected. Demand was particularly strong in China and from tourists.
The company said it expects trading to be in line with expectations for the year. Progress is also being made with 
plans to cut £120m of costs by 2020 and revitalise the brand.
First-quarter progress is encouraging, but it is not as broad as some may have hoped for in terms of geography or 
product lines. Overall, though, this is encouraging stuff. At 2,357p, we remain buyers. AH Buy INDUSTRIAL 
SUPPORT SERVICES EXPERIAN (EXPN) What we said: Buy When: 22 February 2018 Price: 1,558p Share price 
change to date: +52% Overall organic revenue growth of 6 per cent at constant currencies might suggest business 
as usual for Experian (EXPN) during its first quarter. But its performance to 30 June 2019 has slipped from the 
double-digit growth we saw across North America and Europe and the Middle East (EMEA)/Asia Pacific at May's 
full-year results.
While North America did deliver 8 per cent organic revenue growth at constant currencies, EMEA/Asia Pacific 
dipped by 1 per cent. Against a large number of contract wins at the same point last year, a 13 per cent decline in 
organic decision-making tools sales in the UK and Ireland weighed on the business-tobusiness segment. This 
served to neutralise the modest return to growth in consumer services.
Despite the premium valuation, our previous buy recommendations were predicated on Experian's continuing 
momentum. At 2,369p, the shares have retreated from our most recent call (2,412p, 4 July). With tentative signs of 
a slowdown, we think it prudent to move to hold. NK PERSONAL CARE, DRUG & GROCERY STORES RECKITT 
BENCKISER (RB.) What we said: Buy When: 27 July 2017 Price: 7,592p Share price change to date: -13% Reckitt 
Benckiser (RB.) has reached a $1.4bn (£1.1bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to put an end to the long-running investigation into the sales and marketing of 
Suboxone Film by Indivior (INDV), its former prescription pharmaceuticals business, which was demerged from the 
group in 2014. This represents the largest penalty related to the US opioid crisis, trumping the $600m paid by 
Purdue Pharma, the company that makes opioid drug OxyContin.
Despite the settlement, Reckitt Benckiser maintains that it "acted lawfully". Management believes that the 
settlement is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders as it avoids the costs, uncertainty and 
distractions of an ongoing investigation.
The company plans to fund the settlement payment through existing debt facilities and cash generation and will 
increase its current provision of $400m to $1.5bn.
This appears to be a case of damage limitation and we remain buyers at 6,572p. JF INDUSTRIAL METALS & 
MINING ANTOFAGASTA (ANTO) What we said: Buy When: 27 June 2018 Price: 1,011p Share price change to 
date: -10% A World Bank arbitration board has ordered Pakistan to hand over $5.8bn (£4.6bn) to an Antofagasta 
(ANTO) and Barrick Gold (CAN:ABX) joint venture for the "unlawful denial of a mining lease" covering the Reko Diq 
copper and gold project in 2011.
It is unlikely Pakistan will just hand over the cash and a "negotiated settlement" is a possibility. Bank of Montreal 
analyst Edward Sterck said the amount awarded appeared "unfeasibly high" and was likely to be reduced. 
Antofagasta said it would not add its share of the owed money to the balance sheet until it had the cash.
Antofagasta is well placed as the copper market stays tight, with a deficit forecast this year and low stocks set to 
continue for several years, according to Wood Mackenzie's numbers. Although that won't help the first-half earnings 
after prices fell back down to $5,800 a tonne ($2.63 a pound) in June, equaling the lows of the past two years.
The possibility of a $2bn-plus payout (minus the hefty legal bill) adds to the company's investment case. AH Buy

Refutes social media Ryanair (RYA) chief executive Michael O'Leary refuted news speculation that the airline would 
rename its Boeing 737 Max 8 jets following two fatal crashes at other airlines. Photographs of a Ryanair jet that 
appeared to have been renamed '737-8200' had circulated on news and social media. Mr O'Leary also said that 
Ryanair had not discussed the aircraft's name with manufacturer Boeing. Commentators have raised the issue of 
late, including US President Donald Trump, who said that if he "were Boeing" he would fix and rebrand the jet.

Buyback rejigged Ryanair (RYA) has changed the terms of its (EURO)700m (£627m) share buyback programme to 
limit the number of shares held by non-EU shareholders in case of a no-deal Brexit. The share buyback - which is 
slated for between May 2019 and May 2020 - would allow block purchases of shares from EU shareholders. EU 
rules currently require more than half of shares in European airlines to be owned by EU citizens, to which UK 
shareholders will not count following Brexit.

Higher passenger numbers saw budget airline Wizz Air (WIZZ) hit the top end of its lowered profit guidance for the 
12 months to 31 March off the back of a 16.7 per cent increase in passenger numbers. Wizz had dropped its 
guidance on net profit from (EURO)310m-(EURO)340m (£274m-£301m) to (EURO)270m-(EURO)300m, but hit 
(EURO)292m in the year to March. At the same time, fuel costs jumped 39.2 per cent year on year to 
(EURO)668m, rising alongside staff costs (up 34.6 per cent) and aircraft rental (up 18 per cent).
Chief executive József Váradi said the carrier could withstand these increases better than other airlines. Mr Váradi 
said air traffic control issues would continue across Europe, though. One response has been to follow Ryanair's 
lead on charging for larger cabin bags, which it says will speed up boarding. Berenberg reported this had 
contributed to a 15 per cent increase in non-ticket revenue in the December quarter, although the ratio between 
ticket and ancillary revenue remains flat at 1.4 times.
Bloomberg consensus forecasts suggest adjusted pre-tax profit of £373m and EPS of 276¢ for the March 2020 
year-end, climbing to £459m and 332¢ in FY2021.
Wizz has managed to keep its profit margin at 12.5 per cent and expects net profit to increase to between 
(EURO)320m and (EURO)350m this financial year off the back of an anticipated 40m passengers (FY2019: 34.6m). 
Shareholders were not sold on the numbers, however, pushing Wizz's shares down 4 per cent in early trading. But 
the revenue growth coming in from the last quarter of FY2019 and consistent profit margin means Wizz remains a 
buy. AH Buy Ord Price: 3,051p Market Value: £2.22bn Touch: 3,039-3,051p 12-Month High: 3,814p Low: 2,300p

Higher oil prices, steep discounting and issues with Boeing's 737 Max aircraft are by now familiar ingredients in 
European airlines' soggy in-flight meal of a reporting season. But full-year results for low-cost operator Ryanair 
(RYA) still managed to disappoint investors, and landed with a cautious outlook for the rest of the calendar year.
¢ Share price 1,034¢ 2000 1500 1000 500 0 2018 2019 Passenger traffic rose by 7 per cent in the 12 months to 
March, and should grow another 8 per cent in the current financial year. But a further drop in fares - down from the 
FY2019 average of just (EURO)37 (£32) - means the group is increasingly reliant on ancillary sales to reach its 3 
per cent targeted increase in revenue per passenger (RPP). A percentage point variance in either direction will be 
the difference between group profits of (EURO)750m or (EURO)950m. This year, the fuel bill is likely to increase by 
another (EURO)460m, while other costs could nudge up 2 per cent on the back of movements in the pound, 
tougher comparisons and delays to the delivery of five 737 Max jets, which removes "any meaningful cost benefit" 
until FY2021.
Prior to these results, analysts at Numis were forecasting adjusted pre-tax profits of (EURO)989m and earnings of 
80¢ a share for the year to March 2020.
The buy case for Ryanair's shares was boosted here by the board's approval of a (EURO)700m share buyback. A 
19 per cent jump in ancillary sales to (EURO)2.4bn in FY2019 also shows a knack at navigating price wars, 
although additional pressure on earnings looks all but assured. AN Sell

The recent results from On the Beach (OTB) and Thomas Cook (TCG) have both underlined just how challenging 
the travel market is at the moment. Now easyJet (EZJ) is warning of a drop in per-seat revenues in the second half 
of the financial year.
p Share price 925p 1900 1650 1400 1150 900 2018 2019 Brexit-related uncertainty and a broader macroeconomic 
slowdown in Europe have contributed to the malaise, offsetting operational initiatives such as improving its pricing 
algorithms and speeding up the development of product bundles. In an attempt to counter the negative macro 
environment, management is focusing on customer service and on-time performance. Over Easter, the group had 
no flight cancellations and only eight, three-hour delays from 7,300 scheduled services.
Around 41.6m travellers took to the skies with easyJet in the half-year, a 13.3 per cent increase on the first half of 
FY2018, only slightly adrift of the rise in capacity over the same period. Hence, the load factor (capacity utilisation) 
was down a percentage point to 90.1 per cent.
The group had to contend with rising hedged fuel costs, up 7.1 per cent at constant currencies, while bearing an 
estimated £10m in cancellations and related passenger welfare costs due to drone disruption at Gatwick. These 
issues, along with inflationary cost pressures, such as higher regulated airport charges, drove the per-seat spend 
up 3.9 per cent.
Conversely, revenue per seat decreased by 7.4 per cent at constant currencies, although the group said top-line 
comparisons were skewed due to the application of the new IFRS 15 accounting standard, the cancellation of 
Ryanair's winter schedule in the UK, and the annualisation of prior year benefits such as Monarch's bankruptcy.
Management lowered guidance for constantcurrency revenue per seat, now saying it will be down over the full year. 
What's more, forward bookings for the third quarter are three percentage points behind last year at 72 per cent 
EASYJET builds capacity in poor market TRAVEL & LEISURE
while fourth-quarter bookings are flat at 34 per cent. Luckily, costs per seat are also expected to fall - assuming 
normal levels of disruption - and so the group is maintaining its adjusted pre-tax profit guidance. Broker Numis 
expects full-year pre-tax profits of £415m, giving EPS of 83.6p, down from £578m and 117.4p in FY2018.
Given political uncertainty and industry malaise, we're tempted to moderate our stance, but a forward rating of 12 
times forecast earnings is hardly prohibitive. The trade is not without risk, but we still think it is outweighed by the 
current yield on offer. TD Buy Ord Price: 925p Market Value: £3.67bn Touch: 924.6-925p 12-Month High: 1,809p

In June last year my university friend invited me to help open her summer house on Lago Iseo, Northern Italy, at the 
foothills of the Alps near south eastern Switzerland. Her family is from the region, and they came and went, all 
ages, swimming, cooking, mucking around, eating and chatting - some in local dialect.
After a simple lunch on the curving terrace at the water's edge, we were clearing up, she fiddling with the slippery 
plastic bags for food waste, me with the empty bottles, others grappling with the labyrinthine recycling system. I 
didn't have the heart to tell her that 20 years of this wouldn't undo the damage done by her return Ryanair flight 
from Stansted to Bergamo.
'The airline industry, in its history, has never made money'' Pondering the fate of the airline industry, I am indebted 
to a Bloomberg journalist and the Swedish people for giving a name to my uneasy feelings: 'A flying shame'. Year-
on-year passenger numbers in the Nordic nation have fallen for seven consecutive months and train journeys are at 
a new record high (32m). Like the internal combustion engine and vehicles, jet engines' days might be numbered 
too. Let's look at a random sample of airline-related share prices, not forgetting the famous adage: "The airline 
industry, in its history, has never made money''.
So many bankruptcies, takeovers and state bailouts mean few have long-term share price charts. Hong Kong's 
Cathay Pacific (HK:0293) has form here, with rather unsteady progress since 1985. Midway between 2009's low at 
HK$7 and record high around HK$24, it looks cheapish.
Ryanair (RYA) is one of the most successful budget airlines, reflected in share price action since 2009. It has 
suffered badly over the past 18 months, halving from almost (EURO)20. Cheap again today, but the chart pattern 
might be a head-andshoulders top; prefer to avoid.
Aviation woes; It's an industry with a long history of problems ; THE TRADER
Across the Atlantic, JetBlue (US:JBLU) was also a young price-cutter in the vast domestic US flight market, then 
morphed into one of its biggest players. The chart hints that the shares struggle to hold over $25, but fairly neat 
consolidation in a massive right-angled triangle since 2015 hint it's setting up for another upside test.
A related stock is Rolls-Royce (RR.), which has price history - and form. After a catastrophic collapse in 2014-15, 
the chart dusted itself off, picked up the pieces and put on some seriously steady price gains since; looking good.
Airports themselves might be at risk. Dubai International Airport in 2018 handled 89.1m passengers, up just 1 per 
cent on the previous year and the weakest annual growth in at least a decade - admittedly after 15 good years. As a 
hub for Emirates and a tourist destination, this is a problem.
The writing might be already on the wall because this month two huge new terminals were launched. Jewel Changi 
Airport in Singapore cost $1.25bn and is a pre-security attraction with a circular waterfall and jungle at its heart. Its 
280 retail and dining outlets, hotel and multiplex cinema are testament to gaudy luxe. Istanbul, where Turkish 
Airlines ballooned over the past 10 years as a short-haul hub between Europe, Asia and Africa, has a totally new 
facility on the Black Sea, billboards pronouncing: "This is not just an airport. It's a monument to victory.'' When 
finished, it will have six runways and four terminals able to handle 200m passengers. One of President Erdogan's 
"crazy projects'' - who thinks big!

UK-listed airline groups are preparing to meet the EU's rules on share ownership in order to retain their flying rights 
Many newspaper headlines have been devoted to voicing concerns about the visa status of UK citizens looking to 
travel abroad on holidays this summer. What may be a greater concern to would-be travellers is whether or not 
those planes can even take off. UK-listed airlines have been busy in recent months preparing for all possible Brexit 
scenarios. Some have been more transparent about their plans than others, leading shareholders to become 
understandably nervous about those companies who have been quiet on the matter.
'Ryanair and EASYJET have both announced that they will strip the voting rights of non-EU shareholders so that 
the companies adhere to the rules' It's not only investors who are feeling frustrated. The EU is too. European 
transport commissioner Violeta Bulc has criticised airline groups for "gambling" that the UK would indeed get an 
extension in the lead-up to the original 29 March deadline, according to reports by the Financial Times. Ms Bulc 
claimed that some have not submitted plans for their course of action in the event of a hard Brexit, as is required by 
the EU. One airline that the EU commissioner confirmed had not submitted plans was International Consolidated 
Airlines (IAG), owner of British Airways and Iberia, but added that those who have not done so will have a two-week 
extension to file with the EU following a no-deal Brexit.
One set of rules that UK-listed airlines have been preparing for are those around shareholder ownership. The EU 
requires that more than half of shareholders in airlines flying routes within Europe must be EU citizens. Ahead of 
Brexit, UK investors count towards this threshold, but naturally this will no longer be the case once the UK leaves. 
IAG notified shareholders in February that it would cap the number of non-EU investors allowed to buy its shares at 
47.5 per cent, the existing proportion at the time of the announcement. Those investors outside the EU who buy 
shares in IAG will now be forced to sell within 10 days if that purchase means that non-EU ownership exceeds that 
threshold.
Airline share ownership rights in focus
Budget airlines Ryanair (RYA) and EASYJET (EZJ) have both announced that they will strip the voting rights of 
non-EU shareholders so that the companies adhere to the rules that airlines must be majority EU owned and 
controlled. As soon as UK shareholders are no longer considered EU citizens, they will be categorised as restricted 
shares, whose owners are not able to attend, speak or vote at a general meeting. Ryanair has yet to disclose what 
proportion of its shareholders to which this will apply. EASYJET stated that its EU ownership currently stands at 
49.92 per cent, still below the 50 per cent plus one share threshold.
Fellow UK-listed budget airline Wizz Air (WIZZ) has faced the opposite issue. It is based in Budapest, Hungary, so 
the proportion of EU shareholders is not an issue. Instead, it established Wizz Air UK and has secured a UK route 
licence, a "future-proofing" measure so that the airline can continue to fly between the UK and the EU regardless of 
the outcome of Brexit discussions, deal or no deal.
There is still some time remaining for UK-listed airline groups such as IAG to sort out Brexit preparations, with a 
two-week grace period following a hard Brexit for companies to submit their plans to the EU, and six months to 
comply with applicable EU ownership and control requirements.
• When we put Ryanair on a sell recommendation recently, we said UK investors may in fact be doing the airline a 
favour by offloading their shares. Ultimately, UK shareholders in these companies will have to decide how much 
these voting rights mean to them. For an investor holding the shares in the hope they will appreciate in value and 
perhaps provide some income, the ability to have a say at the general meeting may not be a top priority. We think 
that EASYJET has been the best airline at communicating its Brexit plans and progress to the market consistently. 
It's also a strong budget brand with a healthy balance sheet.

Shares in UK-listed gambling companies took a beating on the back of speculation that the government could 
introduce stricter regulation on the bookies in the upcoming Spring Statement. While all the major gambling 
companies saw their shares drop, the move was most pronounced for GVC (GVC), with a decline of around 16 per 
cent. Significant share sales by two senior members of management exacerbated investor concerns.
Chief executive Kenny Alexander sold more than 2.06m shares (68 per cent of his holding), while chairman Lee 
Feldman sold 900,000 (75 per cent), both at 666p per share, banking £13.7m and £5.99m, respectively.
Share sales can be a red flag, especially when it comes alongside speculation of stricter regulations and when UK 
gambling companies are still adjusting to the stake cut on fixed-odds betting terminals from £100 to £2. When GVC 
reported, just a couple of days before the sales, we thought that 675p, or 13 times forward earnings, looked like a 
buying opportunity for a company that looks well placed for US expansion. The shares have now dropped to 589p, 
and the share sales have made us wary. JF Hold GVC What we said: BUY When: 18 JANUARY 2019 Price: 940P -

change to date: +6% Ryanair (RYA) has announced its contingency plans in case the UK crashes out of the EU 
without an exit deal. Shares owned by non-EU investors, which will soon include UK residents, will be classified as 
"restricted shares" and stripped of voting rights, and even the right to attend the general meeting.
Non-EU investors will also be banned from buying new Ryanair shares. Management intends to keep this structure 
in place until it is confident that lifting these restrictions would not impact any of its airline licences.
In addition to Brexit blues, Ryanair is also facing ongoing staff disputes, weaker fares and rising fuel prices. We are 
impressed by its low-cost business model, but in the short term there is too much turbulence. At 1,194¢, or 13 times 
forward earnings, we think there may be more downside to come. JF Sell HEALTHCARE EQUIPMENT &

change to date: +1% We had speculated that medical devices giant Smith & Nephew (SN.) might look to 
reinvigorate sales growth with acquisitions. We have not had long to wait since tipping the shares a month ago. The 
group has announced the acquisition of Marylandbased Osiris Therapeutics for $19 (14.5p) a share, or $660m in 
total.
The target company is a specialist in regenerative medicine products, including skin, bone graft and articular 
cartilage substitutes - an area that Smith & Nephew boss Namal Nawana says will help "immediately accelerate" 
the larger group's wound management business.
The offer represents a 37 per cent premium to Osiris' 90-day volume weighted average share price prior to this 
announcement. The deal is expected to boost Smith & Nephew's earnings from 2020, and should also generate a

23p Share price change to date: -14% Last we heard from Sirius Minerals (SXX), discussions over its secondstage 
financing had moved from bank and government loans on equal terms to include a third, possibly more expensive, 
debt capital markets tranche.
That picture was upended on Tuesday, when the prospective potash miner said it had received "a conditional 
proposal from a major global financial institution" that would entirely replace the $3bn (£2.3bn) multi-tranche 
structure, and remove a critical uncertainty in the construction of its Woodsmith project.
Sirius said the proposal "offers a more flexible and attractive solution". It paused discussions with the original 
funding group in a bid to get firm commitments by the end of April.
Sirius shares leapt 9 per cent on this development. With the Woodsmith project coffers set to run dry in a matter of 
months, this news appears positive for our long-term buy call, even if events are set to come down to the wire. Buy

20p Share price change to date: -21% The measurement of hydrocarbons is both a subjective and a scientific 
exercise, as this week's events in the North Sea have shown. On Tuesday, Cairn Energy (CNE) used its full-year 
numbers to impair its 29.5 per cent stake in the underperforming Kraken field by $166m (£126m), writing off 6.8m 
barrels of proven and probable oil reserves in the process.
Kraken's operator and majority owner, EnQuest (ENQ), thought otherwise, and cited an "independent third-party 
audit" and a variance in technical approaches to explain why its own reserves estimate was left unchanged at the 
end of December. Investors couldn't handle such inconsistency, and EnQuest shares ended the day down at a 
three-year low of 15.9p.
Cairn impaired its stake in Kraken to reflect production system issues, weatherrelated incidents and a higher water-
cut than originally expected. EnQuest's refusal to re-evaluate its key asset suggests it has a lot more to lose from a 
19 per cent reserves downgrade than its joint venture partner. Peel Hunt believes further downgrades are possible.

Bear points Third-quarter losses Ongoing employee disputes Expecting weaker fares Fuel price rises Bull points 
Strong business model Consistent load factor Ryanair's (RYA) Michael O'Leary is known for being obsessed with 
costs and how to cut them. This was the strategy that built Ryanair as we know it today, but this could also be the 
source of problems as staff fight back.
IC TIP Risk rating: Timescale: The airline was forced to cancel thousands of flights last year as pilots and 
employees went on strike to protest about their working conditions and voice the desire for a recognised union. 
These widespread cancellations damaged Ryanair's reputation for punctuality and customer service, and 
contributed to added costs. During the third quarter, costs excluding fuel increased by 6 per cent, largely due to 
higher staff costs (including the 20 per cent pilot pay increases), investment in engineering headcount, pilot and 
cabin crew training, and costs associated with air traffic control strikes. These staffing issues are not yet fully 
resolved. What's more, the cost of fuel increased by a third year on year. Ryanair has hedged 90 per cent of its fuel 
requirements for next year at a price that is higher than this year.
costs are rising against the backdrop of increasing competition in the European airline industry. Ryanair expects 
more rivals to fail and close bases in 2019 due to industry overcapacity, but in the meantime fares are falling across 
the sector. Indeed, average Ryanair fares fell 6 per cent to under (EURO)30 during the third quarter. In January, it 
lowered fare guidance for the second half to a 7 per cent decline, from the 2 per cent decline previously expected. 
While thirdquarter ancillary revenues (just over a third of sales) rose by 26 per cent, the company still reported a 
(EURO)20m loss for the three months. Full-year profits are expected to be between (EURO)1.0bn and 
(EURO)1.1bn, compared profit Brexit is another potential headache. Indeed, UK investors in Ryanair looking to 
offload shares may be doing the airline a favour. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal then UK shareholders will 
no longer count towards the 50 per cent threshold of shares needed to be owned by EU www.nationals.UK 
Oncoming turbulence from Ryanair TRAVEL & LEISURE RYANAIR ( RYA ) SELL
shareholders will not be forced to sell their shares, but could lose voting rights, and therefore be put at a 
disadvantage to their European peers.
RATING HIGH SHORT TERM with a (EURO)1.45bn after-tax profit last year.
It's not all bear points for Ryanair.
Ultimately, the airline has the lowest cost base in the industry, a strong balance sheet and an industry-leading load 
factor of 96 per cent. The advantage of the model is illustrated by last year's handsome operating profit margin of 
23.3 per cent and leaseadjusted return on capital employed of 17.1 per cent - something most other airlines might 
envy. It's investing to keep ahead of the pack with the first delivery of the five "gamechanger" B737 Max aircraft 
from April. These aircraft are 16 per cent more fuel efficient with 4 per cent more seats. Management expects these 
to make unit costs more favourable over the next five years.
The company also believes it has found a more efficient group structure, and over the next 12 months Ryanair will 
split out Ryanair, Ryanair UK, Laudamotion and Ryanair Sun. This is a similar structure to British Airways and Iberia 
parent company International Consolidated Airlines (IAG). Mr O'Leary will become group chief executive. His 
replacement as chief executive of the Ryanair division is yet to be found.
True, there is plenty to like about Ryanair's business model. And, in the longer term, it should ultimately be a 
beneficiary of current industry travails. However, facing such a broad spread of issues against a tough industry 
backdrop looks like a recipe for nearterm earnings disappointments to us. The shares' current rating is roughly in 
line with the wider sector and only a slight discount to its two-year historical valuation. We think investors would be 
better off waiting on the sidelines until there's more clarity on the issues dogging the outlook. Sell. JF

Controversial Ryanair (RYA) boss Michael O'Leary announced plans to step down as chief executive of the airline, 
as it reported a pre-tax loss of (EURO)22m (£19m) for the final three months of 2018 from a (EURO)113m profit the 
year before. Mr O'Leary will remain as the head of the group's holding structure for a further five years, as the 
airline announced plans to move to an arrangement "not dissimilar to that of IAG", with a small management team 
overseeing Ryanair, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK. Chairman David Bonderman also announced 
plans to step down in 2020.

JULIA FAURSCHOU Budget airline Ryanair (RYA) is known for its low fares and outspoken chief executive. And it's 
fair to say that both were the focus of attention following the group's recent profit warning - its second in four 
months. Chief executive Michael O'Leary blamed "lower than expected" winter fares for the profit shortfall - fares 
that could fall further still.
While cheap airfares are a blessing for travellers, the root cause of such deals could put investors on edge - and 
rightly so. The European short-haul market is a saturated space and overcapacity has forced several airlines to cut 
prices to stay competitive against peers. Mr O'Leary said short-haul overcapacity had plagued the European market 
this winter, although he thinks this lower fare environment will "shake out more lossmaking competitors, with WOW, 
Flybe (FLYB), and reportedly Germania, for example, all currently for sale".
But even without the rampant capacity issues in the European airline industry, the sector has been a difficult place 
to be, both for operators and investors. Air traffic control strikes - mainly in France - resulted in months of delays for 
all the major operators in 2018, while related compensation added significantly to costs. Ryanair was also affected 
by its own pilot strikes, while oil prices have been on the rise too, further adding to the cost base.
All aboard Managing capacity is a delicate business. On the one hand, adding more planes and seats can provide a 
timely boost to revenues - but only if additional tickets are sold. Adding capacity doesn't do a company any good if 
those seats aren't filled - and certainly not if fuel is wasted by flying half-empty planes.
Flybe has learned this the hard way. The airline has struggled to undo costly mistakes of the past - namely 
expanding too quickly by overordering new planes, while operating lossmaking routes. While some progress had 
been made in cutting down routes and flying fuller planes, its load factor continued to trail that of rivals. 
Are airlines nearing capacity? The European air travel sector is increasingly competitive and airlines are 
struggling to manage capacity in the market
Unfavourable currency movements and rising fuel prices exacerbated these issues, prompting the airline to put 
itself up for sale in November 2018.
But in light of recent developments, Flybe might not be up for sale much longer. The airline's management has 
recommended that shareholders accept an offer from Connect Airways - a newly formed joint venture between 
Stobart Group (STOB), Virgin Atlantic and US-based Cyprus Capital Partners via DLP Holdings. But the 1p a share 
or £2.8m valuation prompted some shareholders to question whether this truly reflected the company's worth. If it is 
determined to be fair, it's a demonstration of how poorly managed expansion can damage shareholder value.
The deal aims to combine Virgin Atlantic's branding with Stobart's aviation business, which will then become part of 
Connect Airways. The idea is that short-haul Connect Airways flights could operate in harmony with Virgin's longer 
routes: when a long-haul flight arrives at a destination in the UK or Ireland, Connect can fly the passengers to their 
final location. The clue, it seems, is in the name.
An interesting idea in theory, but it's difficult to gauge what would set Connect apart from other existing short-haul 
operators. It's also worth noting that Virgin's previous UK short-haul operator, Little Red - whose purpose was to 
help long-haul Virgin customers connect with other parts of the UK - was wound down after only a couple of years 
of operation.
In short, Connect will have to contend with more established operators. Ryanair and EASYJET (EZJ) have 
traditionally led the way, particularly in terms of load factor. Even smaller operator Wizz Air (WIZZ) has steadily 
improved its load factor despite pushing ahead with expansion plans. Over the rolling 12 months to December 
2018, Wizz increased capacity by 18.4 per cent to more than 36.6m seats, with a 19.6 per cent increase in 
passengers pushing the load factor up 1 percentage point to 92.4 per cent.
Despite being in a rapid expansion phase, the group has clearly been managing added capacity well to date. Case 
in point: rising oil prices prompted Wizz to scale back capacity plans from an 18 per cent increase to just 14 per 
cent during the second half of this financial year - a prudent step to keep expansion plans rolling without pushing 
the dial too far.
Of course, even with the best intentions, managing capacity can sometimes fall out of an airline's control. In a 
recent first-quarter update, EASYJET reported an 18.2 per cent increase in capacity to 24.1m seats, but load factor 
fell 2 percentage points to 89.7 per cent, in part due to the "dilutive impact" from the Berlin Tegel airport slots 
bought after Air Berlin's collapse. This also weighed on revenue per available seat - a figure expected to decline 
more in the wake of IFRS reporting changes and a later Easter.
Brexit beware Meanwhile, Brexit has been the looming spectre over the travel industry. Both Mr O'Leary and 
International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) chief Willie Walsh are clearly concerned that the UK will leave the 
European Union (EU) without sufficient legislation to allow UK airlines to fly to and from European destinations. The 
European Commission (EC) addressed these concerns in November with the publication of a contingency 
document, which proposed measures to ensure that UK operators can continue to fly to and from EU destinations - 
but only if the UK offers reciprocal arrangements. The document also said the UK would be added to the visa-free 
travel list post-Brexit, implying short-stay travel would avoid disruption.
While this sounds promising, possible restrictions on new routes and frequencies could make growing operations 
difficult. Routes currently offered by UK airlines to the EU could be frozen from 29 March 2019 for 12 months if a 
Brexit deal is not agreed, according to the Airports Council International's (ACI) analysis of the statement. The 
Commission's contingency proposals include a stipulation where UK airlines wouldn't be allowed to add new routes 
or increase frequencies on current routes during that 12-month post-Brexit period.
The ACI's director general, Olivier Jankovec, estimated this would result in the loss of around 140,000 new flights 
and nearly 20m passengers. On the other hand, the currently tabled Brexit deal would allow such operations to 
carry on business-as-usual.
Are airlines nearing capacity? The European air travel sector is increasingly competitive and airlines are 
struggling to manage capacity in the market
A no-deal Brexit may put a pause on capacity plans. And while it's anyone's guess as to how Brexit negotiations will 
eventually play out, a deal could ensure that capacity constraints aren't a concern. That said, investors in airlines 
might want to err on the side of caution, perhaps choosing companies that have secured the necessary operator 
certificates to continue flying no matter the outcome. Overcapacity in the European market doesn't mean operators 
should automatically scale back either. Data from the ACI shows demand for air travel is growing. That should 
create an environment where quality operators can continue to thrive.
Favourite As one of the IC's Tips of the Year, EASYJET is a clear favourite. The airline is prepared for any Brexit 
outcome, with 130 aircraft now registered in Austria, and its spare parts pool and crew licence transfers expected to 
be completed ahead of 29 March. Around 49 per cent of EASYJET shares are now owned by shareholders in the 
European Economic Area (excluding UK) - close to the 50 per cent  ;
threshold needed to continue flying to and from the EU. The more than 5 per cent dividend yield is also attractive to 
income seekers. The shares have fallen by a fifth over the past 12 months to trade at 1,227p, or 10 times forward 
earnings, which analysts at Liberum believe is undervalued.  ;  ;  Outsiders We'd been bearish on Flybe for well 
over a year before the struggling airline put itself up  ;
for sale. But once the announcement was made in November, we acknowledged that the shares could jump on 
news of a decent offer. But the 1p-a-share offer from the Connect Group joint venture and ensuing loans 
demonstrates just how dire the situation has become. And, given the associated outrage from some shareholders, 
it's not yet clear if the deal will go through. The business clearly has fundamental problems.  ;

Listen to the likes of Ryanair's (RYA) Michael O'Leary and International Consolidated Airlines' (IAG) Willie Walsh, 
and you may be tempted to hold off on booking your holidays for summer 2019. Such airline bosses have not been 
shy about their concerns that the UK could leave the EU without a deal, and more importantly without an agreement 
on aviation rules. They warn that there is no World Trade Organisation (WTO) equivalent to the Open Skies 
Agreement that currently allows British planes to fly to and from the EU without disruption, and so they could be 
forced to ground flights post-Brexit in a no-deal scenario.
But cooler heads may prevail. In November the European Commission published a contingency document 
presenting new rules to ensure that UK operators can continue to fly back and forth to EU destinations, assuming 
the UK offers reciprocal arrangements. According to the Commission outlines, the UK would also be added to the 
visa-free travel list post-Brexit, meaning short-stay travel would avoid disruption. Looks as though those summer 
holidays can go ahead as planned. Airlines such as easyJet (EZJ) and Wizz Air (WIZZ) are one step ahead of their 
peer group, and have obtained the necessary air operator certificates so they can continue to fly post-Brexit.
But regardless of Brexit, UK-listed airlines and travel companies are facing turbulence elsewhere. Overcapacity in 
the European air travel sector is an ongoing concern, resulting in the recent collapse of airlines such as Air Berlin, 
Monarch and Primera Air. Wizz Air recently interrupted its streak of upping expectations by cutting capacity 
expansion plans from an 18 per cent increase to 14 per cent during the second half of its financial year to March 
2019. This looks like a wise move, as the precaution has so far helped to boost yield and load factor. Rival easyJet 
has been taking advantage of the difficult times for others by scooping up airport slots left behind, such as those it 
bought at Berlin's Tegel airport from Air Berlin.
One might not think that warm weather would present such a problem for travel companies, but during the 
unusually sunny English summer of 2018 that appeared to be the case. Tour groups Tui (TUI) and Thomas Cook 
(TCG) both blamed poor summer trading on the hot weather at home discouraging Brits from booking a last-minute 
Turbulence in airlines and tourism AIRLINES & TOURISM
holiday. But others say the weather is a scapegoat for more structural issues. Most of this scepticism seems to be 
centred on Thomas Cook, which ended 2018 with two profit warnings in as many months. Tui has, so far, been 
more resilient than its rival, which management attributed to the group's "double diversification" - both across 
destinations and markets. Still, a fall in profits shows that the company has not been immune to these challenging 
conditions. Investors will wonder if Tui can maintain its resilience through 2019.
Another tourism-related company under pressure to improve its performance in 2019 is Millennium & Copthorne 
Hotels (MLC). Competitive markets in London and New York have made it difficult to improve revenue per available 
room and profits. Refurbishments have been under way to draw people back into updated locations, but this has 
come at a cost in the form of a cut to the dividend. Investors are likely to be wondering whether dividend increases 
will be reinstated in the coming year once planned refurbishments are finished. Management at InterContinental 
Hotels (IHG) has taken a strikingly optimistic tone in comparison to Millennium & Copthorne. It's planning to roll out 
new rooms at a record pace with a focus on Asia. At the half-year results last year chief financial officer Paul 
Edgecliffe-Johnson said the Chinese government was keen to support tourism, which makes the hotel sector a 
clear focus for growth. JF Favourite In contrast to the dividend cut at Millennium & Copthorne, InterContinental 
Hotels raised its dividend last year. It takes a more asset-light approach than its peer after it sold off much of its 
hotel assets to become a hotel management business. InterContinental draws in new asset-owning customers by 
improving the efficiency of their booking systems. We think 4,140p, or 17 times forward earnings, is worth paying for 
this resilient cash-generative business.
Outsider We have Millennium & Copthorne on a hold recommendation, so it's a bit unfair to say it's a complete 
outsider. Increases to the dividend have been put on ice until sometime after current renovations have been 
completed, and we're inclined to stay on the sidelines until there's greater clarity on the shape of the business at 
that time. We'd also like to know how management plans to stimulate growth in competitive markets such as 
London and New York.

Management is to divert cash towards investing in "value-creating opportunities" JULIA FAURSCHOU Stobart 
Group (STOB) has given a teaser of what is meant when it promised a "capital review" to determine the optimal 
way to generate shareholder returns: the fourth-quarter (Q4) dividend has been slashed to 1.5p, compared with 
payments of 4.5p during the first three quarters. The ultimate conclusions of the review, announced at the first half 
results in October, are not due until next March.
Since March 2017, dividend payments have been funded primarily through non-core asset disposals, prompting 
analysts at Stifel to view the move to cut the dividend as unsurprising. Instead, the proceeds from disposals will now 
be used to invest in "value-creating opportunities" in the aviation and energy divisions. Stifel analysts have forecast 
a 6p total dividend a year for FY2020 and FY2021. A spokesperson for Stobart said the remaining dividend 
payments would be funded through "existing cash and other resources", although the cash outflow from operating 
activities more than doubled to £18.1m at the half year.
Stobart's focus will be on how to best deploy disposal proceeds in the aviation and energy businesses. The 
company has around £149m-worth of non-strategic assets based on the book value. Since Stobart began the 
disposal process in March 2017, it has spent £67m on its operating divisions and £105m on dividends.
During the first half, passenger numbers at Stobart's London Southend airport were up 37 per cent to 838,742. 
Stobart is aiming to have 5m passengers per year through the airport by 2022, estimating that £10 of cash profits 
could be generated per passenger. However, the logistics group still has to improve the infrastructure at Southend 
so that it has the capacity to sustain that many travellers, such as extending runways and expanding terminal areas. 
Both Ryanair (RYA) and EASYJET (EZJ) have commercial deals for planes based at Southend.
Stobart also has ambitions to extend the services it can offer in its energy business and to supply 3m tonnes of 
biomass per year by 2022. Stobart supplied 657,950 tonnes during the first half - a 72 per cent increase on the

previous year, but it is looking at how it could increase its scale in energy, including building, owning and operating 
renewable energy plants.
• We tipped Stobart Group as an income play, knowing that the company would fund dividends through disposals 
until around 2023 - by which point profits from its operations are expected to be able to cover the payments. Based 
on Stifel's revised 2020 forecasts, the shares offer a potential dividend yield of around 3.4 per cent, down from 
upwards of 8 per cent. The reinstatement of dividend increases will rest on whether Stobart can achieve its lofty 
2022 ambitions. At 179p, we move to hold.

Amongst the outrage that has surrounded Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal, it would have been easy to miss 
that on one point the EU has given some ground this week - it has proposed that British nationals will be able to 
visit the bloc visa free once the UK leaves, even without a deal, quashing once and for all fears that organising a 
holiday to Magaluf would, post March 2019, become a bureaucratic nightmare.
Getting there - or, as has more often been the case, getting back - may be another matter, not just because there 
remains the outstanding question of what a Brexit 'no deal' will mean for airlines flying to the UK, but because their 
numbers appear to be dwindling by the week. Last month saw the collapse of two more European operators, 
Cypriot operator Cobalt Air and Danish airline Primera Air, adding to a growing list of casualties that have at several 
points over the past few years left passengers stranded in various European destinations.
But should investors give up on this troublesome sector altogether? Warren Buffett has been consistently critical of 
airlines as investments, and his view that "the worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant 
capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money" perfectly describes many airlines, not least Flybe 
which this week put itself up for sale after consistently struggling to turn a profit. Of course, many failed airlines 
have been very small - a massive disadvantage in an industry in which scale is becoming a necessity to overcome 
rising costs, not least - until the last couple of weeks at least - a rising oil price. With no sign of air travel demand 
abating, bigger players could ultimately benefit from the current squeeze as overcapacity is taken out of the market.
Yet as the collapse of flag-carrier Alitalia in 2017 shows, industry conditions are toughening for major players, too, 
with the finger pointed firmly at aggressive competition from the likes of Ryanair. The Irish airline has itself suffered 
a difficult year disrupted by strikes and, last week, the confiscation of one of its planes by French authorities over an 
unpaid bill of (EURO)525,000 relating to a dispute over its receipt of illegal state subsidies from a regional airport. 
Ryanair eventually coughed up the cash, but this is a situation worth keeping an eye on - last month, the European 
Commission opened an in-depth investigation into whether the airline had again been in breach of state aid rules, 
THE EDITOR Altitude sickness
this time in respect of its agreements with Frankfurt-Hahn airport in Germany. It is concerned that these "may give 
Ryanair an undue economic advantage vis-à-vis its competitors that might amount to incompatible aid in favour of 
Ryanair", similar to concerns previously expressed by rivals.
Whatever the outcome of the probe, it is symptomatic of the incredible complexity that sits behind the airline 
industry, whether logistical, political or financial. So, while airline shares may be cheap right now, like a Ryanair 
flight they are cheap for a reason.

Flybe's (FLYB) board has commenced a formal sale process, saying that it is in discussions with "a number of 
strategic operators" about a potential purchase.
The budget carrier has spent recent years trying to undo its past mistakes, including expanding too quickly in a 
saturated European airline market. It's made some progress, with a 9 per cent reduction in capacity during the first 
half of its financial year alone, giving way to an improvement in load factor from 76 per cent to 84 per cent. Still, that 
utilisation rate trails far behind that of larger rivals such as EASYJET (EZJ) and Ryanair (RYA).
Capacity problems have been exacerbated by currency headwinds and rising fuel prices. Chief executive Christine 
OurmiÈres-Widener said these factors, coupled with slowing growth in the European market for short-haul flights, 
has prompted a strategic review of the business, including ways to accelerate further capacity reduction, cash 
management and cost savings, and Flybe has now put itself up for sale.
One potential acquirer is Stobart Group (STOB) - the owner of London Southend airport made an unsuccessful bid 
to buy the airline earlier this year. In February, Stobart stated that it had funding in place to buy the business, but a 
month later it was announced that the two companies could not reach an agreement on a deal.
It has been suggested that a dispute over how to fund the Flybe acquisition is what spurred Stobart founder Andrew 
Tinkler to try to oust chairman Iain Ferguson. Such a purchase could prevent Flybe's plans to wind down operations 
at Stobart's Southend airport by 2020.
• The shares have fallen nearly 70 per cent over the past 12 months to trade at 12p, giving the airline a market 
capitalisation of just over £25m. A valuation of 2.2 times enterprise value to forecast consensus cash profits 
represents a discount of more than half to both its two-year historical average and to its peers. The company 
Flybe puts itself up for sale TRAVEL & LEISURE
expects to report a pre-tax loss of £12m by the full year, which suggests further de-rating in the shares could be 
ahead. However, given the potential for an uplift in the shares - which rose 5 per cent on this news - if a deal is 
agreed, we move from sell to hold.

IShare price 1,197¢ ¢ 2000 1750 1500 1250 1000 2017 2018 t was a turbulent first half for Ryanair (RYA) following 
ongoing pilot disputes and air traffic controller strikes in continental Europe. In early October, management warned 
that pretax profits would land between (EURO)1.1bn (£97m) and (EURO)1.2bn - a 12 per cent downgrade on 
previous expectations. Investors were pleasantly surprised, then, that this figure actually came to (EURO)1.3bn, 
with the shares up around 5 per cent on results day. Passenger numbers increased by 6 per cent to 76.6m with 
load factor maintained at 96 per cent, although the average fare fell 3 per cent to under (EURO)46.
Improvements in ancillary revenue, up nearly a third during the period to (EURO)1.3bn, were offset by higher fuel, 
staff and compensation costs. And although more than 100 new routes were added to the summer 2018 season, 
weaker fares and higher oil prices have forced the airline to trim winter capacity by 1 per cent. Even so, 
management still expects traffic numbers to increase to around 141m by the end of the financial year, boosted by 
Ryanair's 75 per cent stake in Austrian airline Laudamotion.
Analysts at UBS expect EPS of 970¢ during the year to March 2019, compared with 1,200¢ in FY2018.
If the oil price rises, or if average fares fall further, then more capacity cuts look likely - even if the (EURO)540m 
returned to shareholders via share buybacks hints at a more optimistic tone. On that note, while higher fuel prices 
added to first-half costs, 90 per cent of Ryanair's fuel needs for the next 12 months are hedged at $68 per barrel -
well below the $85 spot price. Still, we're too wary of recent volatility to turn bullish just yet, especially when the 
shares still look expensive compared with their historical two-year trading average and the wider sector. JF Hold

Ap Share price 207p 290 260 fter a heated boardroom battle, Stobart Group (STOB) is looking to put past issues 
behind it. One of its core projects is the expansion of London Southend Airport (LSA). The airport was used by 
838,742 passengers in the period under review, a 37 per cent year-on-year increase, which fed through to a 14.6 
per cent rise in pro-forma underlying cash profits to £15.7m. Those figures exclude the £18.1m of accelerated 
investment spent on Flybe's (FLYB) operations at LSA, which will wind down operations by 2020. Both easyJet 
(EZJ) and Ryanair (RYA) will expand their operations, with the latter alone expected to bring in an additional 1m 
passengers each year from 2019. This means that Stobart Group is likely to reach its goal of seeing 5m passengers 
through LSA by 2022.
230 200 2017 2018 The biomass energy business has powered ahead with 657,950 tonnes sold, representing a 
71.9 per cent rise on FY2017, as plants that were commissioned last year are now approaching commercially viable 
volume levels. Pro-forma underlying cash profits from energy were up 88.8 per cent to £8.7m. But some sites 
continue to be underutilised as the commissioning of third-party power stations remains challenging, leading to 
£2.2m of non-underlying costs. While the company has done well to progress with its objectives, it has yet to 
completely overcome previous management issues. Michael Williamson has been appointed interim chief financial 
officer after Richard Laycock stepped down from the role ahead of July's annual general meeting, where Iain 
Ferguson was re-elected as chairman despite protests from former chief executive and Stobart founder Andrew 
Tinkler. A preliminary hearing for the case between Mr Tinkler and Stobart was held the day before the results, with 
the formal hearing scheduled for November.
Analysts at Stifel expect pre-tax profits of £10.4m during the year to February 2019, giving EPS of 2.9p, compared 
with a £6.5m loss and 2.9p loss per share in FY2018.
Stobart progresses Southend expansion AIM: INDUSTRIAL TRANSPORTATION
Unfortunately, the management disputes kicked off just after we tipped Stobart Group, so our recommendation has 
had a volatile time so far. Hopefully, a relatively swift resolution in November will engender a period of relative calm. 
For potential investors, at least the boardroom ructions have given way to a forward dividend yield approaching 9 
per cent - that's a silver lining of sorts. JF Buy Ord Price: 207p Market Value: £733m Touch: 207-208p 12-Month

The budget airline cut full-year profit forecasts due to a combination of strikes, falling ticket prices and more 
expensive fuel Aprofit warning from Ryanair (RYA) means it's not just customers feeling disgruntled and 
inconvenienced by flight cancellations. Indeed, investors sent the budget airline's shares plummeting by nearly a 
tenth.
Ryanair has cut its full-year profit guidance by 12 per cent to between (EURO)1.1bn (£980m) and (EURO)1.2bn, 
against previous guidance of (EURO)1.25bn and (EURO)1.35bn. This excludes Laudamotion, the Austrian airline in 
which Ryanair has acquired a 75 per cent interest.
The reasons for this downgrade are manifold - starting with coordinated strikes by pilots and cabin crews, which 
caused lower traffic and weaker fares in September.
These strikes came despite Ryanair's move to recognise unions in December 2017. While progress has been made 
in the UK, Ireland and Italy, negotiations have been trickier in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Holland and Belgium.
And even though the airline managed to operate 90 per cent of its flights on strike days, chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said customer confidence had been hurt by cancellations. Fares in the second quarter fell 3 per cent, 
compared with previous expectations of a 1 per cent increase. A recovery had also been expected in the third 
quarter, but those hopes now appear dashed. Ticket prices in the second half are now forecast to fall by 2 per cent.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair couldn't disregard the potential for further disruptions this year, which "may require full-
year guidance to be lowered further". This could lead to "further trimming of loss-making winter capacity". Winter 
capacity has already been cut 1 per cent, mainly on flights from the Netherlands and Germany.
Ryanair : walkouts weaken profits TRAVEL & LEISURE
Around 10 per cent of Ryanair's fuel requirements were unhedged, so the oil price rise to $82 (£63) per barrel 
means fuel costs will be (EURO)460m more than last year. Analysts at Numis cut full-year post-tax profits from 
(EURO)1.2bn to (EURO)0.92bn, primarily on the back of fuel cost inflation. They believe a return to growth is 
"unlikely".
Conversely, EASYJET's (EZJ) recent pre-close trading statement confirmed that headline pretax profit would hit the 
upper end of expectations at between £570m and £580m - despite a £115m loss on its recently acquired Belin 
Tegel operations. Capacity increased by 4.2 per cent to 90.3m seats, although this was slower than expected due 
to external disruption.
• We're growing bearish on Ryanair, whose shares have lost nearly a third of their value over the past year. We 
must ask whether this decline prices in all the bad news, or if more could follow. At 14 times forward earnings, the 
group is trading in line with its two-year historical valuation. So we remain neutral. Meanwhile, we think easyJet has 
done well to mitigate extra costs while it continues to add capacity, so we remain buyers.

It's fair to say that the airline sector has had its share of headlines this year. Widespread air traffic control strikes in 
France and Italy, rising fuel costs and issues at Ryanair (RYA) have featured heavily. This follows on from a 
number of airlines going into administration, including Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia in 2017. Therefore, it would 
be easy to assume that the sector must be in some difficulty, and investors may be wondering how to respond to 
the latest events.
But recent figures from Heathrow Airport showed that it enjoyed the busiest first six months of the year in its history, 
handling 38.1m passengers during the period. Retail revenue rose 4.8 per cent and the airport, which is owned by 
Spanish group Ferrovial, managed to raise nearly £1bn from investors to help future development. Prospects for the 
industry were also helped by Parliament's decision to approve the building of a third runway at Heathrow.
EasyJet (EZJ) is one of the clear winners. Recent thirdquarter figures showed ancillary sales up 21 per cent in the 
period and there may be even better to come as the company says it is looking at doing more packaged holidays in 
future, a move that owes much to the fact that its new chief executive has come from global tourism group Tui. The 
market was impressed with the figures as they showed how resilient the company is despite a range of challenges.
The current picture for the airline sector is a little more complicated than normal. However, we believe that the long-
term trend towards increased demand for both business and leisure travel provide a good background for investors, 
although some occasional turbulence is to be expected. Ian Forest is an investment research analyst at The Share 
Centre

JULIA FAURSCHOU Heading into this financial year, management at Ryanair (RYA) was on the "pessimistic side 
of cautious". Rightfully so, as after-tax profit during the first quarter fell by a fifth to (EURO)319m (£285m). Costs 
have crept up, including a 40 per cent jump in "right to care" compensation when more than 2,500 flights were 
cancelled due to air traffic control strikes in France. The budget airline is bringing its grievances to the European 
Commission over "unacceptably frequent" disruptions in France. The cancelled flights also wiped 14 percentage 
points off Ryanair's punctuality score, now at 75 per cent.
Staff costs added to the burden, up by more than a third on the back of pay increases and more flying hours. 
RYANAIR recently began to recognise trade unions, and already around 66 per cent of its staff are covered by 
agreements. This related to employees based in the UK, Italy, and Germany; reaching deals with unions in Spain, 
Portugal and Belgium has proved more difficult.
'The cost of fuel increased from around $50 a barrel during the first quarter of 2017 to $80 a barrel during the 
reported period' Oil prices have also been on the rise. The cost of fuel increased from around $50 a barrel during 
the first quarter of 2017 to $80 a barrel during the reported period. Around 90 per cent of Ryanair's fuel 
requirements are hedged at $58 a barrel, but the remaining unhedged balance will add at least (EURO)430m to the 
total fuel bill by the full year. Just over a third of required fuel is hedged at $58 per barrel for the first half of FY2020.
While Ryanair likes to boast about its low fares, it has perhaps got more than it bargained for. The average ticket 
price fell 4 per cent to (EURO)38.68, and this competitive environment is not expected to reverse in the near term. 
In this first quarter, the falling fares coupled with rising costs meant the net margin fell from 21 per cent to 15 per

cent. Management now expects fares to rise by 1 per cent during the second quarter, down from original forecasts 
of 4 per cent.
Ryanair and fellow budget airline easyJet (EZJ) updated the market just days apart with dramatically different 
results. Both cancelled a similar number of flights due to the air traffic control strikes, but easyJet also managed to 
upgrade full-year pre-tax profit forecasts. Wizz Air (WIZZ) cancelled 145 flights during its first quarter, a fourfold 
increase on the previous year, which wiped 14 per cent ((EURO)50m) off profit.
Yet during the period Ryanair has had to deal with something that its peers have not: staff disputes. On top of air 
traffic control strikes in France, it's also been faced with industrial action from Irish pilots. Its crew have gone on 
strike two days so far this summer, with another two days planned this season. This industrial action has dented the 
profitability of some routes through Ireland, prompting management to cut the Dublin-based fleet from 30 planes to 
24 from this winter. These planes will be moved to more profitable areas, such as its Polish airline Ryanair Sun.
Ryanair is also less prepared for Brexit than easyJet or Wizz Air, which have both secured the necessary air 
operator certificates to continue to fly no matter the outcome of leaving negotiations. The Irish airline has applied for 
a UK air operator certificate to protect routes that fly to or from Britain, but warned that they may have to restrict the 
voting rights of non-EU shareholders in the event of a hard Brexit.
• Overcapacity in the European airline industry, especially on German routes, and further expected strikes from 
both air traffic controllers and Ryanair pilots will not make it any easier for management to increase ticket yields 
further. Disputes with its workers and the ensuing flight cancellations have damaged Ryanair's reputation and 
reliability. This will make it difficult to sell last-minute, higheryielding tickets this summer. However, Ryanair has 
finally started to prepare for Brexit, but we think peers such as EASYJET and Wizz Air are better placed. The latter 
two also do not have the staff problems Ryanair does. At 1,438¢, or 13 times forward earnings, the shares are 
trading in line with their twoyear average historical valuation, which we think offers little value given the ongoing 
challenges with the workforce. The airline may be making progress with its staff by working with unions, but much is 
yet to be done. Hold.

England may not have beaten the rest of the world at its favourite sport this summer, but judging by recent updates 
from the consumer industry the UK is challenging for honours in one of its favourite pastimes: drinking. In particular, 
supermarkets and purveyors of premium mixers have, like England's World Cup team, exceeded expectations, and 
share prices are flying - unlike Ryanair's strike-stricken planes (see this week's news spotlight on page 11).
Such a summer of celebration may seem at odds with the gloomy post-Brexit prognoses that, like the booze, flowed 
thick and fast this week. Perhaps the electorate are increasingly in need of a stiff drink, given warnings of food and 
medicine shortages to come. More likely is that most aren't paying attention or simply don't believe the hype - 
figures from research group IHS Market this week showed that households are optimistic about their finances for 
the first time in over two years, and in July splashed the cash at a faster rate than they had since early 2015.
'Also fizzing to record highs this week were shares in Fevertree Drinks' Much of this extra spending has found its 
way into supermarkets, which according to data from industry tracker Kantar Worldpanel saw their sales climb 3.6 
per cent in the 12 weeks to 15 July, including £287m spent on booze alone in the week of crunch World Cup games 
against Colombia and Sweden. That and the ongoing boost from the heatwave has provided further support for a 
broad sector recovery, which has seen the FTSE 350 Food and Drug index climb nearly 50 per cent since 
November. In the case of Tesco - whose fall from grace was greater than most of its rivals due to a major 
accounting scandal - analysts expect this to continue, with 13 out of 23 recommending the shares as a buy, versus 
just four saying sell.
That's somewhat at odds with outlandish predictions this week that food rationing could soon be on the way back, 
but then again it is common for pessimism to overshoot reality. In investing this is known as the 'negativity bias' 
which causes most people to place significantly more emphasis on bad news or experiences than good - as much 
as three times more, according to some scientists. This spring's tech sell-off provides a great example of that bias 
Mood swings THE EDITOR
in action - the Cambridge Analytica scandal saw many predicting meltdown for the sector, but instead the FAANGS 
(Netflix excluded) have swung back to hit new record highs.
Also fizzing to record highs this week were shares in Fevertree Drinks, whose results this week revealed that its 
expensive tonics are more in demand than ever (see page 50). That said, like tech stocks it would take an 
incredibly optimistic investor to buy its shares now - its shares trade on a PE ratio of nearly 80, which surely only 
makes sense if it can crack the US market, a graveyard for many a British company, including Tesco. One slip up, 
and the pessimists will be out in force.

TRAVEL & LEISURE Flybe still focused on utilisation rates Just as some other European airlines are snapping up 
excess capacity from collapsed rivals such as Monarch and Air Berlin, Flybe (FLYB) is downsizing. Network 
capacity during the second half of the financial year fell by 5.2 per cent, compared with an 11 per cent increase 
during the corresponding period in FY2017. Available seat numbers have also been pared back, as the European 
carrier looks to build the load factor (utilisation rate) and revenue per seat.
Share price 37p p 50 45 40 35 30 Chief executive Christine OurmiÈres-Widener said the fleet size is now "under 
control". Passenger revenue increased by 9.1 per cent to £676m, but cost per seat was up 10.9 per cent mainly due 
to higher maintenance costs and weak sterling. As a result, Flybe reported a £14.8m operating loss - better than the 
£31m loss in the prior year. The previous year's results have been restated to account for an onerous lease 
provision, resulting in a £28.6m adjustment in the year to March 2017, and £1.3m in the reported period.
2017 2018 Analysts at broker Numis expect a £4.9m pre-tax loss in the year to March 2019, giving a loss per share 
of 2.3p, compared with losses of £13.8m and 6.4p in FY2018.
Flybe has narrowed its losses over the period, and the current financial year is off to a good start, with 10.9 per cent 
growth in revenue per seat. Load factor improved by six percentage points to 75.6 per cent, still well adrift of the 
comparative rates for budget airlines EASYJET (EZJ) and Ryanair (RYA). We need to see more progress on 
boosting unit profitability before we change our stance. JF

Ryanair for LSA Stobart (STOB) looks set for an uplift in revenue, after Ryanair (RYA) announced plans to begin 
flying from London Southend Airport (LSA) as of summer 2019, which the support services group owns and 
operates. The agreement will see Ryanair invest around $300m to have three planes based at LSA, which will fly 13 
routes to eight European countries. This is expected to bring at least an additional 1m passengers through the 
airport during the first year, and more than 5m in five years. The initial agreement is for five years but can be 
extended to up to 10 years.

Homeserve (HSV) shares have performed well in recent months, rising from around 720p in early April to close to 
900p in early June, spurred by good recent trading and plans to create an online home repairs platform that 
promises to become the "Airbnb, Just Eat or Expedia" of its sector. The question is, why is management selling 
shares right as they seem to be taking off? Johnathan Ford, the group's chief operating officer, sold roughly a 
quarter of his stake, while global chief executive of the membership business, Tom Rusin, sold a fifth of his. Both 
sales were made just days after the release of full-year numbers in which management announced its "best year 
ever" thanks to growing customer numbers in North America and a sharp increase in adjusted operating profits.
Both Mr Ford and Mr Rusin retain sizable holdings and, given the impressive growth in the share price in recent 
years and strong recent performance, it's understandable to want to bank some gains. Buy at 898p. TD Ryanair 
boss offloads shares Budget airline Ryanair (RYA) is "on the pessimistic side of cautious" when it comes to the 
current financial year. Sales are expected to increase, but at a slower rate than costs. Last year wasn't easy, either, 
with rising fuel prices and troubles with pilot scheduling. Granted, Ryanair's low ticket prices helped boost 
passenger numbers to more than 130m with an "industry-leading" load factor of 95 per cent.
One of the most significant issues causing turbulence at Ryanair is what it plans to do in the absence of a Brexit 
aviation deal. If an agreement isn't struck before September, then summer 2019 scheduling could be affected. Chief 
executive Michael O'Leary sold 2m shares at (EURO)16.49 (£14.45) each, leaving the airline boss with around 
44.1m shares, or a 3.8 per cent stake. A representative from Ryanair would not comment on the (EURO)33m 
(£28.9m) transaction.
September is a mere three months away and the government doesn't appear to have made much progress on 
Brexit at all, let alone an aviation deal. Mr O'Leary has previously threatened to ground flights between the UK and 
the continent if an agreement isn't found. We think there are too many red flags to justify an entry point at 1,676¢, or 
14 times forward earnings. Hold. JF

Despite overcapacity in Europe, rising fuel prices and major pilot scheduling problems last September, Ryanair 
(RYA) reported a 10 per cent rise in post-tax profits to (EURO)1.45bn (£1.27bn) for the year to March 2018. This 
came after lower fares triggered a 9 per cent increase in traffic to more than 130m passengers, meaning the group 
saw an "industry leading" load factor (utilisation rate) of 95 per cent.
Costs fell by 1 per cent, helped by fuel hedging, but excluding fuel they were up by 3 per cent - stemming from the 
aforementioned pilot issues, which caused flight cancellations, and higher secondhalf staff costs driven by pay rises 
and five-year pay deals.
Share price 1,589¢ ¢ 2000 1800 1600 1400 2017 2018 These results were satisfactory given the circumstances, 
but management's outlook for the 2019 financial year is "on the pessimistic side of cautious". Traffic should grow by 
7 per cent to 139m, but costs are set to rise by 9 per cent. Higher staff and oil prices will add over (EURO)400m to 
Ryanair's fuel bill. In all, profits are expected to fall to between (EURO)1.25bn and (EURO)1.35bn.
According to Bloomberg's consensus average, analysts expect adjusted EPS of 122¢ for the year to March 2019 
(flat on FY2018).
Ryanair's blended forward PE ratio represents a sizeable discount to its two-year historic average against other 
airline peers - attractive, although this rating reflects the challenges faced by the group in the past year or so. Given 
bosses' less than positive view of FY2019, and continued planning for a 'hard Brexit', we're neutral as the cited 
headwinds play out. HC Hold

Mick is 34, and he and his wife have a net household income of at least £100,000 a year. They own their home, 
which is worth about £800,000, on which they have a £500,000 mortgage with 26 years left to run. They have one 
young child, and hope to have another soon.
"We put about £15,000 to £20,000 a year into our employer pensions, including additional contributions, but I have 
no idea how much our pots are worth," says Mick. "We would like our investment portfolio to have a value of about 
£1m in 26 years as I hope to retire at age 60. I would like it to pay out an income of 3 per cent to 4 per cent a year.
"I reinvest all of the dividends I get from the investments in my trading account and invest £2,000 to £5,000 new 
capital a year.
"I have been investing for around seven years and would say that I have a medium to high attitude towards risk. I 
would be prepared to lose up to 20-30 per cent of our portfolio's value in any given year.
"I invest in businesses that impress me as a customer or do something different, and I sell holdings when I am 
unimpressed as a customer. I use Twitter to gauge customer sentiment towards companies and brands. I also do 
some high-level research, but would not say I am driven by the detail and the numbers in my decision-making 
process.

to enjoy robust growth, and have recently invested in Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS:OSL) and International

boom-or-bust investment that would make a comeback or die.
"I am also considering investing in EASYHOTEL (EZH). But I appreciate that there is significant risk relating to this 
cyclical industry so would like to reduce my exposure to it soon, and have recently sold Ryanair (RYA). I am also 
considering investing in Tesco (TSCO) and Iomart (IOM) "As well as our equity portfolio, we own wine worth 
£15,000 to £20,000, which we hope to drink someday, and art worth £20,000 to £30,000. We also have £15,000 in 
gold, £9,000 in silver and £6,000 in palladium."
THE BIG PICTURE Chris Dillow, Investors Chronicle's economist, says: You're doing two major things right: saving 
a lot regularly and reinvesting dividends.
Reinvesting dividends matters because it's likely that most of the long-run returns on shares will come from 
dividends rather than growth. This is for a simple reason. Average yields, for example 3.7 per cent on the FTSE All-
Share index, exceed likely gross domestic product (GDP) growth of maybe 2 per cent. This means that if dividends 
grow in line with GDP over time and share prices in line with dividends, then capital growth will only be around 2 per 
cent. So dividends will account for most future returns.
The opposite will only happen if dividends and, by implication, profits rise as a share of national income or 
valuations rise.
Both are possible in the short term, but less likely over the long run.
However, I'm puzzled as to why this portfolio isn't held in a tax-efficient wrapper. It should be in an individual 
savings account (Isa), as making sure you don't pay unnecessary tax is one of the most important things an 
investor can do.
You have no idea what your pension is worth, so find out. And you don't say whether your pension is defined-
contribution and, if so, in what it is invested, or definedbenefit (final salary). This difference matters. If you have a 
defined-benefit pension you might be able to afford to take on more equity risk in other investment accounts 
because this type of scheme carries less. It'll only take you a few minutes to find this out.
David Henry, investment manager at Quilter Cheviot Investment Management, says: I would recommend that both 
you and your wife use your annual Isa allowances. Your joint allowance for the current tax year of £40,000 is 
material in the context of the portfolio. And in a world where forward returns on asset classes are expected to be 
low relative to history, ensuring that your net return is as high as possible is very important.
Given the strong financial position that you are in, it is likely that when you come to retirement your estate will have 
grown to a size where it will be subject to inheritance tax. So it may be worth drinking some of that wine before 
then.
As you have been investing for around eight years your experience is based on a broadly positive period for equity 
markets. But your equity portfolio is extremely concentrated, so I would be concerned that in a protracted bear 
market your paper losses would be in excess of the 20-30 per cent level you say you would be comfortable with.
You have exposure to other assets that may reduce your overall risk, but nonetheless you need to consider how 
you might react when markets turn.
Nick Lamb, investment manager and head of WH Ireland's Bristol office, says: A young growing family is expensive, 
as is paying off a significant mortgage. So to try to get your investments to hit a target of £1m in 26 years, it is 
essential that you have a regular savings plan that you review often to ensure that the objectives and needs are on 
track.
The right collection of investments could yield 3-4 per cent, although this is maybe at the higher end of what is 
possible. So get some professional advice and establish your objectives, appetite for risk and capacity for loss. 
Every investor has different needs and objectives.
Address the issue of concentrated risk Our readers should broaden their mix of holdings and use Isa wrappers
Your strategy should include using tax-efficient wrappers to mitigate potential capital gains tax. If you and your wife 
make use of your annual Isa allowances, which are currently £20,000, and contribute to your pensions, your goals 
could be achieved.
You have a long enough time horizon over which to save towards your goals, although whether you achieve them 
will depend on your investments' returns, which can be volatile and variable - particularly if you have exposure to 
equities.
Want to see your portfolio analysed by our experts? email portfolio.clinic@ft.com None of the commentary here 
should be regarded as advice.
It is general information based on a snapshot of the reader's circumstances.
How to improve the portfolio Chris Dillow says: This portfolio's heavy exposure to airlines means you are taking lots 
of cyclical risk - even the best-managed airlines will suffer more than most in a recession.
We have one warning sign of a global recession: the shape of the US yield curve. When yields on 10-year US 
Treasury bonds have fallen below the federal funds rate in the past, a recession has usually followed within months. 
Unfortunately, though, more investors are now aware of this so they might be quicker than usual to dump cyclical 
stocks if or when this happens. That means you might not be able to get out at the right time.
But you have some protections, such as your cash savings. Another is your precious metals, which might do okay if 
oil prices surge, another thing that is bad for airlines. And they might do well in a recession, as falling bond yields 
are often good for gold.
Then there are your future investments. Assuming you and your wife both keep your jobs in a downturn, saving a lot 
means you'll be able to buy lots of shares when their prices are low and expected returns high.
For these reasons, you're not badly placed to take on cyclical risk. And unless we get a big surprise there's no 
reason to believe that a global recession will occur soon, so you've plenty of time to adjust your portfolio. Even so, 
I'd consider lightening exposure to those cyclicals over time.
David Henry says: If you consider adding an alternative to equities I would suggest listed infrastructure. Although it 
is slightly higher risk than conventional bonds, this sector is trading on a discount due to market concerns about 
Labour taking private finance initiative (PFI) projects in house if it gets into power. But these real assets pay a 
predictable and steady income which is often linked to inflation. In view of your and your wife's annual income, if 
you invest in these higher-yielding investments make sure you hold them in Isas to avoid adding to your taxable 
income.
Nick Lamb says: Your existing mix of investments includes a significant amount of cash, which might be good as an 
emergency fund. But with low interest rates and inflation around 2.5 per cent cash is likely to be delivering a 
negative real return.
Physical commodities such as gold normally have custody costs for their safekeeping, so it is important to check 
what these costs are and how much of the returns they are eating away. Consider investing in exchange traded 
commodities (ETCs), which can give you exposure to physical commodities in a more cost-effective way due to 
their lower charges.
Art and wine can go both up and down in value, and have different rules on the tax you incur on their gains. There 
is also the issue of how easy it would be to sell these assets should the need arise, unless of course you keep them 
and enjoy them.
Investing directly in shares carries the risk of total loss if the companies go bust. However unlikely it may seem, you 
only have to look at Carillion (CLLN) to realise that this risk is significant. Diversification is essential, and achieving 
this means ensuring you have invested in a wide enough range of assets, and have exposure to a number of 
different underlying investments in different geographies.
Address the issue of concentrated risk Our readers should broaden their mix of holdings and use Isa wrappers
Exposure to shares for capital growth and income can be achieved in a cost-effective way by investing in collectives 
such as passive trackers or actively managed funds. Although there is an underlying cost, a lower level of risk can 
be achieved for broadly the same outcome.

Brexit turbulence on route for airlines AIRLINES ¦ & TOURISM

Airline bosses have been some of the most vocal about potential Brexit pitfalls, and whether or not UK-listed airlines 
will be able to fly within continental Europe after the UK leaves the EU. The sector doesn't have World Trade 
Organisation (WTO) guidelines to fall back on should the UK leave without a deal and would lose all benefits from 
the current Open Skies Agreement. Any optimism around a customised agreement for the aviation industry has 
been shattered after a leaked document from the European Commission eliminated such an option and confirmed 
fears that the UK airlines would automatically lose the right to fly within Europe.
A high priority for UK-based airlines in 2018 will be ensuring planes can fly within continental Europe from 2019 and 
beyond. Although the UK won't officially leave the EU until March 2019, some semblance of an agreement must be 
negotiated before the end of this year when scheduling begins for the 2019 summer season. As of now, UK airlines 
appear split in their views on Brexit. Some have opted to apply for certificates that ensure their flying rights or set up 
a European subsidiary, while others have been vocal in their disdain for Brexit without much action to protect their 
businesses.
Wizz Air (WIZZ) and easyJet (EZJ) are two of the best prepared airlines should the UK leave the EU without an 
aviation agreement. Wizz Air has applied for a UK Air Operator Certificate, which would allow the central and 
eastern European airline to operate flights to and from the UK regardless of the outcome of Brexit negotiations. 
Easyjet has set up easyJet Europe, an Austria-based subsidiary business that will allow it to fly all its existing routes 
thanks to an Air Operator Certificate granted to it by the Austrian government.
Ryanair (RYA) and International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) haven't said whether they've any Brexit contingency 
plans, but this isn't to say bosses at either airline have remained silent on the matter. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary 
spent much of 2017 urging the British government to negotiate a bespoke agreement, while Willie Walsh at IAG 
encouraged the European Parliament to relax existing ownership rules for European airlines. It's likely that both 
Brexit turbulence on route for airlines AIRLINES ¦ & TOURISM
would fall short of the threshold for 50 per cent of shares to be owned by EU nationals, so we expect to hear more 
on the matter from Mr O'Leary and Mr Walsh, or to see both start to sell down their shareholdings.
Another issue that could dominate the airline sector throughout 2018 is capacity. The fear is that excess capacity - 
particularly in the budget market - could weigh on yields. Some of this pressure was relieved with the collapse of 
airlines Monarch and Air Berlin, but the failure of a major airline has some analysts wondering which could be the 
next to go. While most airlines are continuing to look at how they can expand their routes, smaller players such as 
non-FTSE 350 constituent Flybe (FLYB) have started to reduce services. Cutting 85 planes to just 70 over the next 
three years should ease capacity by around 4 per cent, so the airline can focus on fewer, more profitable routes.
Others have been looking at how to take advantage of the gaps left behind by Monarch. Wizz Air chief executive 
József Váradi said the company has put in a bid for the spaces left over at London's Luton airport, where Wizz Air 
recently opened a UK base. Should the company be successful it would add between 20 and 24 additional routes 
from the UK to Europe.
The collapse of Air Berlin had two very different results for the two biggest listed tour operators. Thomas Cook 
(TCG) reported a full-year operating profit of £12m, compared to a loss of £10m in the prior year, which was aided 
by the demise of Air Berlin as customers turned to the tour operator as an alternative. But the collapse cost Tui 
(TUI) (EURO)15m when the German airline defaulted on payments for aircraft and crew it had leased from the 
group. On a brighter note, holidays to Turkey and North Africa have started to regain popularity after terrorism fears 
had previously seen bookings in these areas slide.
A final - and brief - note on hotels. Both Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) and Millennium & Copthorne (MLC) 
could benefit from earning a significant amount of income from abroad. Intercontinental Hotels is in the process of 
rolling out its new Kimpton chain, the first of which opened in Amsterdam last year, and it's also upgrading various 
Holiday Inn locations and introducing a digital cloud booking system. Shareholders in Millennium & Copthorne will 
be wondering whether it can recover after its lacklustre preliminary results, which reported that increased 
competition in Singapore, terrorist attacks in Paris, and refurbishments in New York resulted in flat pre-tax profits.
Similarly, Merlin Entertainment (MERL) failed to meet analyst expectations for the summer season as the terror 
attacks in the UK put visitors off. Cineworld (CINE) has less to worry about terror, more on how its acquisition of US 
theatre operator Regal Entertainment Group will play out. It's funding the purchase partially through a rights issue, 
which hasn't gone down well with investors, as its share price has been on a downward trajectory ever since the 
announcement. JF Favourite We think Wizz Air (WIZZ) looks to be one of the best prepared for any outcome in 
Brexit. It's already got an application in for its UK Air Operator Certificate - well ahead of the Brexit deadline - and 
ownership restrictions won't be an issue as it could be for others as Wizz Air is a European company with mainly 
EU shareholders. The shares are up nearly 60 per cent on our original buy tip. At 3,685p per share, or 17 times 
forward earnings, we think it's a price worth paying for Brexit insulation and the promise of expansion.
Outsider For now, we think it best to steer clear of Millennium & Copthorne. The picture looked a bit brighter at the 
last trading update, but this was against what we think was a fairly weak comparative set of numbers. Revenue per 
available room recovered in New York, although there was still a decline in Asia and Europe. There's also been 
takeover moves from its largest shareholder, City Developments, which increased its offer price to 600p in 
December last year after its initial 553p attempt was shot down. Now is not the time to buy.

EASYJET soars Monarch bounce Budget airline EASYJET had been suspiciously quiet on the effect of the collapse 
of rival Monarch last autumn, but it appears that the suspected bounce in passenger numbers has come through 
after all. The three months to December 2017 produced a 14 per cent bounce in sales at EASYJET as it 
transported 18.8m passengers, up 8 per cent against the same period a year earlier. Last year was a difficult one 
for rivals as Monarch went bust, Alitalia also finally entered bankruptcy and Ryanair suffered due to a high-profile 
pilots strike, while Air Berlin also went under - with EASYJET snapping up some of its operations.

Capacity bites It was a fraught year for the airline industry as overcapacity continued to bite. However, one airline's 
difficulty is another's fortune. As Air Berlin and Monarch went into administration, budget airlines EasyJet (EZJ) and 
Ryanair British Gas owner Centrica (CNA) and insurer Direct Line (DIR) are expected to produce the highest 
dividend yields among FTSE 100 companies next year. However, dividend cover by earnings is expected to remain 
thin for both, at 1.24 and 1.12 times respectively. The FTSE 100 is forecast to pay out £88.5bn in dividends in 2018, 
according to AJ Bell. That's a 7 per cent increase on the final forecast payout for 2017 and equates to an average 
yield of 4.3 per cent.
(RYA) stood to benefit from some of the capacity being removed from the market. However, the latter had its fair 
share of problems elsewhere. Pilots in Germany staged a walkout in a dispute over pay and working hours. The 
threat of further strikes over the Christmas period forced boss Michael O'Leary to make a U-turn and recognise 
pilots' unions in six countries.

Tp Share price 1,358p 1500 1300 1100 900 2016 2017 his marks the final set of easyJet (EZJ) results for chief 
executive Carolyn McCall, who will leave the business at the end of November for broadcasting giant ITV (ITV). Ms 
McCall will be replaced by Johan Lundgren, former deputy chief executive officer of travel firm TUI (TUI). Mr 
Lundgren certainly has a task ahead of him, as analysts continue to fret about the rising levels of capacity in the 
airline market, and the downward pressure this is causing on passenger yields. On reflection, last year was not a 
terrible one for the budget airline. Annual revenues actually landed higher than some analysts' expectations thanks 
to a record number of passengers - up 10 per cent to 80.2m - and a slightly higher load factor, up from 91.6 per 
cent in the previous financial year to 92.6 per cent in the reported period. 
Strong cost control and savings of £85m meant the £101m in adverse currency movements was partly offset, 
although adjusted pre-tax profits ultimately fell 17 per cent year on year to £408m. EasyJet said recent first-quarter 
revenue trends were more positive than expected thanks to "some capacity leaving the market" - taken as a 
reference to the departure of Monarch Airlines and other carriers. Now, first-half revenue per seat is expected to 
grow somewhere in the low to mid single digits - at constant currencies - compared with a 4.5 per cent drop in the 
2017 financial year, as that extra capacity weighed. Headline cost per seat excluding fuel should rise by 1 per cent, 
in line with the reported period. Also on the horizon is the imminent completion of the group's (EURO)40m (£35m) 
deal to purchase some of Air Berlin's operations at Berlin Tegel airport. The acquisition is expected to add 25 A320 
aircraft leases to easyJet's roster, as well as incur one-off costs of around £100m in FY2018, which should lead to 
initial losses of around £60m.
Liberum expects pre-tax profits of £452m for the year ending September 2018, giving EPS of 93.4p, up from £408m 
and 82.5p in FY2017.
Capacity issues are a concern, even if recent revenues have received a onetime boost from the collapse of 
Monarch and labour-related disruption at Ryanair (RYA). Add to this a top-level management change and shares

trading at 15 times forward earnings, a premium to their recent history, and we see no reason to change our view.

Capacity is always a concern for European airlines, and Flybe (FLYB) is no exception. As such, the company 
believes it prudent to reduce its fleet size from 85 planes to 70 over the next three years as part of a wider 
improvement plan. Capacity should start to fall during the second half of this financial year as it hands back six end-
of-lease aircraft. This marks a 4 per cent reduction in capacity, and management reckons it will allow for better 
focus on fewer, more profitable routes and help to improve customer service. Over the last six-month period, 
capacity had risen by 3 per cent to 6.9m seats.

available seat rose 8.8 per cent to £55.29 but, excluding fuel, cost per available seat also increased by 10.1 per 
cent at constant currencies. Another aspect of the improvement plan is to make Flybe more punctual. Over the 
period the airline reduced flight cancellations by 35.3 per cent, but 'on-time' performance still slipped 3.6 percentage 
points to 78.1 per cent.
Analysts at Liberum expect a pre-tax loss of £15m in the year to March 2018, giving a loss per share of 6.9p, 
compared with losses of £6.7m and 6.2p in FY2017.
Flybe has a lot of work to do to catch up with its European airline peers across most metrics, notably load factor and 
punctuality. Given the recent issues with capacity in that market, we're nervous. Analysts at Liberum forecast 
widening losses at Flybe next year before returning to profitability in FY2019. But we remain cautious until we see 
real signs of progress. JF Sell

TShare price 1,657¢ ¢ he first thing many shareholders will be looking for in the half-year results for Ryanair (RYA) 
is how much the flight cancellations in September and October have cost the budget airline. In the latter half of 
September, and through October, 50 flights were cancelled, or 2 per cent of the 2,200 routes flying during that 
period. Looking ahead, 25 planes out of the fleet of 400 will be grounded for the winter season. So far there's been 
a (EURO)25m (£22m) one-off cost to reschedule affected passengers in September, and a further (EURO)45m is 
expected to be added to full-year crew costs, as Ryanair moves to offer "materially higher pay" for its pilots 
compared with competitors.
2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 2016 2017 The scheduling failure caused punctuality to fall to 70 per cent in the first 
half of September, but "difficult and disruptive decisions" taken in the wake of the problems restored punctuality to 
90 per cent for the 99 per cent of customers not affected by cancellations. Still, Ryanair carried 11 per cent more 
passengers than in the previous year, although the winter grounding of 25 aircraft will reduce full-year traffic from 
131m to 129m customers. Average fares fell by 5 per cent, but more customers chose to spend on reserved seats. 
This helped net profit improve by 11 per cent to (EURO)1.3bn on a relatively flat margin.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary called Lufthansa's purchase of most of Air Berlin's operations "anti-competitive" 
given its 95 per cent share of the German market, but added that Ryanair would continue to grow in Germany. The 
airline will also look to pick up some slack created by the collapse of Monarch, as well as in Italy where Ryanair is 
poised to be the "main beneficiary" of the contraction in Alitalia's short-haul services. Overall, Ryanair is aiming to 
have a fleet of 600 serving 200m customers by 2024. Mr O'Leary pressured the UK to come to a deal on aviation 
with the EU before September next year so that summer 2019 scheduling will not be affected.
Liberum expects adjusted pre-tax profits of (EURO)1.57bn in the year to March 2018, giving EPS of 117¢ (from 
(EURO)1.47bn and 105¢ in FY2017).
Ryanair feels cancellation costs
The (EURO)25m of costs so far relating to flight cancellations only refer to those in the second half of September, 
so costs from cancelled flights in October will be felt at the full year. But management still expects full-year profits to 
fall between (EURO)1.4bn and (EURO)1.45bn, which appeared to encourage shareholders, as the shares were up 
around 5 per cent on results day. At 14 times forward earnings, the shares look fairly valued compared with their 
history and to competitors such as easyJet (EZJ). JF Hold Ord Price: 1,657¢ Market Value: (EURO)19.6bn Touch:

customers. Average fares fell by 5 per cent, but more customers chose to spend on extras like reserved seats. This 
helped net profit improve by 11 per cent to  1.3bn on a relatively flat margin.
Never one to mince words, chief executive Michael O Leary took the results as an opportunity to reiterate his 
position on several issues affecting the airline. He called Lufthansa s purchase of most Air Berlin s operations  anti-
competitive  given its now 95 per cent share of the German market, but added that Ryanair would continue to grow 
in Germany in spite of this. The airline will also look to pick up some slack created by the collapse of Monarch, as 
well as in Italy where Ryanair is poised to be the  main beneficiary  of the contraction in Alitalia s short-haul 
services. Overall, Ryanair is aiming to have a fleet of 600 serving 200m customers by 2024. Mr O Leary pressured 
the UK to come to a deal on aviation with the EU before September next year so that summer 2019 scheduling will 
not be affected.
Analysts at Liberum expect adjusted pre-tax profits of  1.57bn in the year to March 2018 giving EPS of 117¢, 
compared with  1.47bn and 105¢ in FY2017.
Ryanair feels first round of cancellation costs
The  25m of costs so far relating to flight cancellations only refer to those in the second half of September, so costs 
from cancelled flights in October will be felt at the full-year. But management still expects full-year profits to fall 
between  1.4bn and  1.45bn, which appeared to encourage shareholders as shares were up around 5 per cent on 
results day. At 14 times forward earnings, shares look fairly valued compared to their history and to competitors 
such as easyJet (EZJ). Hold.

The latest round-up of news and results from the IC's Companies Team
Mark Robinson
The Bank of England interest rate decision has  gripped the City    apparently. The economist Danny Blanchflower, 
who sat on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the last time it raised interest rates, had argued that the UK s 
current economic performance and the squeeze on household incomes should rule out a rate rise for the time 
being.
However, the MPC obviously thought otherwise and the UK base rate duly ratchetted up to a stratospheric 0.5 per 
cent; or roughly a 10th of its long-term average. The fact that the Consumer Price Index stands 9.7 per cent in 
advance of its average annualised rate since 1990 appears to have outweighed any concerns over its potential 
effect on aggregate demand in the UK economy, or perhaps the MPC simply felt that it had to be seen to be doing 
something anything?
Anyway, Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon, believes the rise  marks the beginning of the end for cheap 
money . Hmm define cheap?  Degraded  might be a more apt description. But if the tripling of UK Plc s balance 
sheet since 2008 failed to spark runaway inflation, it s hard to imagine what will. With the national debt now at 83 
per cent of GDP, a cynic might view the BoE s interest rate move as little more than tinkering at the margins. 
Nevertheless, if the decision heralds successive rate rises, then we might realistically expect some impact on 
consumer facing stocks and the housing market, though the central consideration will be the effect that a rising 
interest rate environment will have on bond markets; ergo the relative attractiveness of debt securities to equities.
The IC's economist Chris Dillow has been looking at the initial reaction to the rise...and some of the possible 
implications. Click here to read his thoughts on the rate rise
To matters at hand: by the time the Companies email lands in your in-box next week, we will have seen results for 
the likes of Marks and Spencer (MKS), Associated British Foods (ABF) and SSE (SSE), signalling the last reporting

Turbulent summer for travel and leisure Terrorist attacks, hurricanes and the failure of an airline resulted in a

JULIA FAURSCHOU It was a challenging summer for a plethora of UK-listed travel and leisure companies. Some 
hotels were forced to temporarily close due to hurricanes that hit parts of the US and Caribbean, and are now facing 
the clean-up process. Ryanair (RYA) made headlines with its flight cancellations after not properly planning 
holidays for its pilots. Some would-be travellers may have put off their holiday all together on fears of terrorism both 
at home and abroad.
Things were tough for Merlin Entertainments (MERL) when it was forced to close Legoland Florida for three days 
when Hurricane Irma hit the south-eastern US. The storm may be over, but fewer visitors are heading to the park as 
local residents focus on cleaning up the aftermath. However, Merlin's management is not too concerned about the 
impact of the storm at group level, since growth at constant currency for its Legoland parks was up by 16 per cent in 
the first three quarters.
'Analysts have voiced concern this year that increasing capacity in the sector, prompted by lower fuel costs, could 
soon put pressure on yields' Meanwhile, Tui (TUI) revealed it will likely have to temporarily close some of its hotels 
in the Caribbean for repairs, while demand for some locations there and in Florida has been noticeably weaker 
going into the winter period. Despite repairs and having to rebook some customers to other destinations, underlying 
cash profits are still expected to grow by around 10 per cent for the current financial year. Similarly, management at 
Thomas Cook (TCG) said September was a challenging month with thousands of customers affected by Hurricane 
Irma, but did not quantify the impact.
However, there was some good news for some of the sector's listed companies. Analysts have voiced concern this 
year that increasing capacity in the sector, prompted by lower fuel costs, could soon put pressure on yields. 
However, the collapse of Monarch at the start of October should alleviate some of that pressure.
Turbulent summer for travel and leisure Terrorist attacks, hurricanes and the failure of an airline resulted in a 
tough summer trading period
Reduced capacity in the European airline industry would be a good thing for EASYJET (EZY) and Ryanair. The 
latter improved its load factor in September by 2 per cent to 98 per cent year on year. Traffic was also up 10 per 
cent to 11.8m customers. That was despite the budget airline cancelling 2,100 flights in September and October, 
due to issues with the timing of its pilot's vacation days. This winter Ryanair will fly 25 fewer planes to make sure 
that all future scheduling conflicts are avoided.
Recent terrorist attacks in the UK and mainland Europe have made travellers nervous about planning a holiday. 
Merlin reported that like-for-like revenue during the first three quarters has been flat on last year due to a tough 
summer season, with fewer visitors to its midway London and European theme parks on terror fears. Management 
noticed an immediate drop off in domestic visitation after the Westminster Bridge attack, with demand further 
dampened by subsequent attacks. Similarly, On The Beach (OTB) reported some softness after the terrorist 
incident in Barcelona.
This contrasts with InterContinental Hotels (IHG), which stated in a third-quarter update that destinations previously 
hurt by terrorism had recovered. Revenue per available room in France improved by 6 per cent during the third 
quarter, with doubledigit growth in Turkey and Belgium. Management at Whitbread (WTB) also said that there had 
been no impact from terrorism on bookings for Premier Inn.
• Terrorism is impossible to predict, and so it's difficult to say what impact it will have on affected companies in the 
future. The hurricanes are over, so expect to see the cost of repairs in the next set of results for the tour groups. But 
it's worth remembering that these will be one-off costs. The failure of Monarch will only be a temporary setback for 
On The Beach - which will incur a one-off cash cost this year for helping customers arrange alternative travel - so 
we're sticking with buy. Meanwhile, Ryanair and EASYJET's low cost model looks resilient enough for now.

Has Ryanair's lean and mean business model gone too far?
No Free Lunch
Forget about the transition to calculating the flying times of pilots over a calendar year rather than a financial one, or 
the need to restore punctuality by cutting flights  to improve the operational resilience of our schedules . The 
underlying reason that Ryanair suddenly cancelled 2,100 flights last month was its lean and mean business model.
The concept of a no-frills, low-cost airline is simply to shift passengers from one place to another. They cannot 
expect any support from the airline when things go wrong. Cancelling flights well in advance fits this model, as does 
disputing the rights of passengers, having to be put right by regulators and only then agreeing to pay compensation. 
Michael O Leary, Ryanair s charismatic chief executive, has pointed out that 2,100 flights might seem a lot but it is 
less than 2 per cent of the 130,000 flights planned. He says that he has grounded 25 of Ryanair s fleet of 400 
planes. The cold calculation of  5m (£4.4m) in lost profits has now increased with compensation to  25m. Other 
claims are pending. But they hardly skin the nose. Net profits in the year to 31 March 2017 were  1,316m. Low-cost 
is a resilient concept: whatever you do, passengers keep coming back for more.
Taxi drivers
But does the same go for its people? Low-cost fares require low-cost staff as well. Cost efficiencies require staffing 
for dips and relying on their goodwill to cope with the peaks. Compared with other airlines, Ryanair has a reputation 
of having more intensive flying schedules. Pilots complain of overwork and fatigue. Insiders have claimed that 
Ryanair has fewer pilots per plane than others, such as easyJet. On the flight deck, most of Ryanair s captains are 
employees but most of the others are on contracts with agencies that exclusively supply Ryanair. They are treated 
as  self employed  despite wearing the Ryanair uniform, which exploited a historic weakness in the employment 
legislation in the Republic of Ireland, where Ryanair has its primary listing. Ryanair pilots based elsewhere complain 
of being on Irish contracts and have been pressing for local contracts for years. They complain of being frequently 
told to report to distant bases at short notice, of having to go in their own time and of paying for the travel and 
accommodation themselves. Mr O Leary is resilient.  We are in an era now where the computer does most of the 
flying. The pilots are very skilled professionals. But are they hard-worked? No.  At least, that s what he has told 
journalists. What are pilots but 'glorified taxi drivers'? And if a few leave, that s fine, there are plenty more where 
they came from, in the training pipeline.
Norwegian Blue
This model works well as long as there is no shortage of pilots. But the balance has shifted, thanks to the growth of 
new airlines, such as Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA in Europe and others in the Middle East and China. IALPA, the 
Irish pilots  union, which Ryanair does not recognise, believes that 700 out of Ryanair s 4,200 pilots have left; 
Ryanair says the number is fewer than 260 and, anyway, it is in the process of hiring 650 more. Of these, 
Norwegian claims that more than 140 have defected to them, the attraction being permanent employment, a 
competitive salary and better working conditions. That s about a third of the 500 hires that Norwegian had targeted 
for this year.
Mr O Leary reacted by firing a broadside at Norwegian, another swash-buckling airline hell-bent on growth, claiming 
that it had  obvious financial difficulties .  They are running out of cash. They are scrabbling around daily,  he told 
journalists early in September and, for good measure, predicted that neither Norwegian nor Monarch would still be 
around by the end of winter. Monarch obligingly went bust. Norwegian, needless to say, calls his allegations 
nonsense. Mr O Leary seemed blithely unaware that he had been sounding distinctly Trumpish.
Board flexibility
If Mr O Leary is as aggressively defensive in private as he is in public, questions must arise about whether his 
conduct in board meetings deters criticism. Concerns about groupthink among Ryanair s directors emerged a few 
years ago. Even today, out of 12 non-executive directors, only five can be said to be truly independent. Of the 
others, three (including the chairman, David Bonderman) have each served for between 16 and 21 years. Nine 
years is the normal maximum. Another three directors are former employees and one is involved with related party 
transactions. The company argues that they are all independently minded and it complies with the UK corporate 
governance code, although not Nasdaq s (where Ryanair also has a listing). It could be argued that by being more 
intimately connected, these directors share a familiarity with the company that should bolster their ability to 
challenge Mr O Leary, but whether or not they do is something only the board members will know.
And yet the board has made some strange decisions. Like agreeing a five-year contract for Mr O Leary. Normal 
practice is for contracts to be no longer than a year. Or awarding themselves share options, which are normally only 
available to employees. Non-executive directors are usually excluded to avoid suspicions that such awards might 
influence their decision-making. And they seem impervious to the discontentment so deeply felt by many of their 
people.
As always, glassdoor.co.uk is revealing. Ryanair positives are staff travel and pay in summer; the main complaint is 
again about being kept on an agency contract for years, nominally self-employed but in reality full-time employees. 
Cabin crews resent having to pay the high cost of training, of having neither basic salary nor sick pay, and being 
pressured to sell rather than worry about passengers  well-being. They complain about hectic working hours, being 
taken for granted by management and, tellingly, the poor quality of some newly recruited colleagues. Admittedly, 
the poor rating is a collection of anecdotal evidence from just 170 past and present staff, but it is consistent with the 
impression pilots recently gave to the media   surely sufficient for independently minded directors to demand to 
know what is really going on.
Dominant, free-talking chief executives always present a tough dilemma for fellow directors. It is particularly hard in 
a company such as Ryanair, where Mr O Leary has led its growth from single plane airline in 1985 to one that now 
carries more passengers than any other in Europe. And yet challenges happen. In 2010, for example, the directors 
at rival easyJet fell out with its founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou over its strategy   and won. And ownership is no 
impediment: while Mr O Leary owns less than 4 per cent of Ryanair, Sir Stelios still owns about a third of easyJet.
Three years ago, faced with allegations that his  bullying, macho  style was driving potential custom away, and with 
a delivery of 175 new planes to fill, Mr O Leary publicly resolved to give passengers a better deal. There was a 
softening in his apathy towards climate change. Based on CO2 emissions per passenger, Ryanair now claims to be 
the cleanest, greenest airline. (A tautology, environmentalists say: reduced emissions per plane helps, but an ever 
increasing number of flights pump ever more noxious gases directly into the upper atmosphere, the growth fostered 
by the zero tax on aviation fuel.) And although Mr O Leary also hinted that he would be less sensitive to criticism, 
his recent robust defence of Ryanair has proved counter-productive. Ryanair still lacks the partnerships and 
Norwegian Blue
alliances that other airlines have. These might have helped it ease its current pressures but a potential deal with 
Norwegian has gone the way of the Norwegian Blue, the deceased parrot in the legendary Monty Python sketch, 
thanks to Mr O Leary s abrasive retaliation. Norwegian has recently formed an alliance with easyJet.
Firefighting
Mr O Leary has rushed through retention payments for pilots who stay on board for the next 12 months. Pay 
increases have been agreed at four out of Ryanair s 86 bases and others are under negotiation. He has promised 
better employment conditions and more disciplined rosters and, yes, Ryanair did  mess up . A head needed to roll 
so Ryanair s long-serving chief operations officer was sacked. But are these panic measures or swift, decisive 
actions that will nip the problem in the bud? Only time will tell.
The real problem is that the dispute within Ryanair is less about pay and more about treating people as mere 
functions. It is about working conditions and job security. Pilots say that they have been taken for granted for too 
long. They object to Mr O Leary and his insults. Ah, but he was only defending them against criticism from 
competitors, he says. His comments were directed at pilots of other airlines and their unions, not to Ryanair s, 
whom he now says are the best in the business. Pilots see this as a coded reference to the Ryanair Pilot s Group, a 
body set up by Ryanair pilots and which claims to have more than half their number as members. But Ryanair s 
terms of employment exclude union representation so, fearing for their jobs, they invited pilots from other airlines to 
form its committee. This has allowed Mr O Leary to dismiss the whole body as a plot to undermine Ryanair. As far 
as he is concerned, local employee councils (but not local employment contracts) work far better than pan-company 
collective bargaining. Precisely, say the pilots. Divide and exploit has gone on long enough. They want the 
safeguards that local employment contracts will bring.
There comes a point where deep-seated grievances become a matter for the board. Mr O Leary has been the 
driving force behind Ryanair s phenomenal growth and many think Ryanair would be a lesser airline without him. 
But the pace of this growth is slowing and investors have had to peg back their expectations. The next stage is 
consolidation and Mr O Leary is not so enthusiastic about that. He has said that his succession has been planned 
and there is only an evens chance that he will want to renew his contract when it expires in 2019. So it s time to 
take stock. For all involved, Ryanair s future boils down to a matter of trust. For Mr O Leary, over-sensitivity to 
criticism has brought its own backlash.

Equities are ending a good week with another rise
Graeme Davies
Shares in London look set to end the week with another gain as the FTSE follows the lead of strong US markets. 
Click here for The Trader Nicole Elliott's latest thoughts.
IC TIP UPDATES:
Finsbury FoodFIF) shares are down marginally this morning as the group warned that, although it s still on track to 
meet adjusted profit targets this year, it would be forced to do so from a lower revenue base. Higher butter prices 
are to blame, which the group says it expects to recede in the coming years. But that still puts significant pressure 
on management to curtail costs to buck up the bottom line. The closure of the group s loss-making Grain D Or 
business - already factored into forecasts - is due to complete in early December. Buy.
LonminLMI) is up 15 per cent this morning, after the embattled platinum miner s banks gave their consent for the 
acquisition of the Pandora joint venture, and a pre-emptive waiver of covenants for the next six months. The group 
also reported a $14m increase in net cash in the fourth quarter of its September-end financial year. Our sell 
recommendation, predicated on Lonmin s high operating costs and the outlook for the platinum market, is under 
review.
KEY STORIES:
Is easyJetEZJ) the best of a bad bunch this morning? A trading update from the group, during which it said annual 
profits would land at the upper end of the £405-£410m range, revealed record passenger numbers over the 
summer. Profits are expected to fall year-on-year as a result of a Brexit-induced £100m currency hit, but it still 
makes for better reading when compared with the Ryanair (RYA) fiasco and Monarch collapse.
OTHER COMPANY NEWS:
Grim data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) yesterday bears little relation to the news 
coming out of car retailer Motorpoint (MOTR) this morning. Shares rose close to 5 per cent in early trading as the 
group revealed it expects to report interim sales growth of 18 per cent. It s a mix of underlying growth mixed with 
Finsbury Food, Lonmin, easyJet & more
new openings: two sites, Castleford and Oldbury, reached their first anniversary in the period, while Motorpoint's 
twelfth site opened in Sheffield in April. Margins have normalised year-on-year but it won t stop the group reporting 
underlying pre-tax profits of £10.5m (2016: £6.4m). Half year numbers are due for release in late November.
Alpha Financial Markets Consulting has released pricing information ahead of its planned admission to the junior 
market on Wednesday. It will have a market capitalisation of around £163m, equivalent to 160p a share. It has 
already conditionally raised a gross £125m via placing with institutional investors. The group provides consultancy 
services to the asset and wealth management industries.
It s been just over a year since ten pin bowling operator Hollywood BowlBOWL) joined the London market. And 
there s good news: the group says successful execution of its strategy post-IPO means it now expects full-year 
earnings to be ahead of expectations. Overall, group revenue for the full year grew 8.9 per cent, with like-for-like 
growth of 3.5 per cent. Despite declaring an interim dividend back in May, as promised, cash generation has held 
up well so a special dividend is still on the cards.
GlobalDataDATA) announced this morning that chief executive Mike Danson intends to sell approximately 1.4m 
ordinary shares via an accelerated bookbuild placing to institutional investors, at 540p each. This is in response to 
demand from investors. Mr Danson will still hold approximately 68.3 per cent of the company s share capital.
Shares in RWS HoldingsRWS) are up more than 8 per cent this morning after the company announced its  best 
year ever , expecting to beat consensus revenue forecasts of £162m by clocking up  not less than £163m .

Our take on the biggest business stories of the past week
Emma Powell
European clampdown
The tax affairs of US tech darlings Amazon (US: AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) have come back under the spotlight 
thanks to the European Commission (EC). Brussels has ordered Amazon to pay  250m in back taxes after finding it 
had been given illegal tax benefits in Luxembourg, which allowed it to pay less tax in other jurisdictions. The EC is 
also planning to take Ireland to the European Court of Justice over its failure to recover up to  13bn in back taxes 
from Apple in 2016. At the time the EC found that Ireland had given the iPhone manufacturer illegal state aid.
Flying high
Passenger numbers buoyant
Passenger number updates from RyanAir (RYA) and Wizz Air (WIZZ) indicate the high level of competition from 
budget airlines that helped drive Monarch into administration. Despite cancelling thousands of flights last month, the 
Irish airline reported a 10 per cent increase in passengers during September to 11.8m, while its load factor   a 
measure of how efficiently an airline is filling its planes   was up 2 per cent to 97 per cent. Capacity at Wizz Air 
increased by a fifth year on year, with passenger numbers up by 23 per cent to 21.8m.
London calling
Equity market recovery
A recovery in London equity market activity this year has been good news for brokerage Numis (NUM). It reported 
revenue up 15 per cent year on year during the six months to the end of September. Management expects profits to 
have risen by a similar percentage. Its corporate broking and advisory business   the strategic focus in recent years   
completed 98 transactions in total, compared with 86 during the same time last year. Equity issuance was up more 
than a third to £2.5bn.
Fracking out
6 October 2017
Scottish ban
The Scottish government has proposed an effective ban on fracking within the country. Energy minister Paul 
Wheelhouse told the Scottish parliament that a temporary ban, which has been in place since 2015, should 
continue indefinitely after a public consultation showed overwhelming opposition to fracking. However, MSPs will be 
given the opportunity to vote on the issue later this issue before a final decision is made. Tom Pickering, operations 
director at Ineos Shale   which has a fracking exploration licence across 700 miles of Scotland   said the move was 
a  a sad day for those of us who believe in evidence-led decision-making . With only the Conservatives opposed to 
a ban, the vote seems more a formality.
Topps at the bottom
Profit warning
Challenging market conditions prompted Topps Tiles (TPT) to warn that adjusted pre-tax profits for the year to 
September would be at the lower end of market expectations. Like-for-like revenues at the ceramics retailer fell by 
2.9 per cent over the year, compared with a 4.2 per cent improvement in 2016. Management tried to reassure 
shareholders that the company maintained good control over gross margins and effective cost management over 
the year, but shares still fell about 3 per cent on the day of the announcement.
Uber for IPO
Board overhaul
On the day Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi met with Transport for London authorities, its board voted to 
overhaul its governance to shift power to more recent investors. The board also agreed to make Uber a public 
company by the end of 2019. The governance changes are dependent on an investment by Japanese telecoms 
and technology group Softbank completing. All  super-voting  shareholders   including former chief executive Travis 
Kalanick   would be stripped of their extra votes, while the board would also be expanded. A consortium led by 
Softbank Vision Fund plans to invest an initial $1bn-$1.25bn in Uber at its current $68bn valuation, and a secondary 
stake by purchasing shares from existing shareholders at a lower valuation.
Another bad news day
Telit warns again
Telit Communications (TCM) has narrowed its financial guidance for the year ending December 2017, and is now 
expecting revenues of $390-400m ($370m in 2016) and adjusted cash profits of $44-48m ($54m in 2016). Further 
restructuring costs may also have an impact on this year s results, while a review of the company s activities 
continues. This follows various setbacks for the self-styled enabler of the  internet of things , including the departure 
of former chief executive Oozi Cats after an independent review found evidence of an historic indictment issued 
against him in the US. In better news, Telit also announced a partnership with Wind River, an Intel company.

Germany was the best-performing market in September, delivering a total return of 5.6 per cent, according to MSCI. 
In the year to date the MSCI Germany Index has returned 25 per cent. Australia was the worst performer, delivering 
negative returns (see chart), but 12.5 per cent so far this year. That s against the All-Country World Index s (ACWI) 
return of 17.8 per cent during the same period. Despite a solid performance, the German market is still priced at 
13.7 times forward earnings, below the 16.1 of the ACWI. </div> </aside>

Our take on the most important business stories of the past week
Emma Powell
KPMG cleared
KPMG, one of the big four accountancy firms, has been cleared of misconduct regarding its audit of HBOS s 2007 
accounts, before the bank went belly-up. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said that the company s work  did 
not fall significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of the audit . It centred on whether there were 
material uncertainties about HBOS s ability to continue as a going concern. KPMG had accepted the bank s 
conclusion that it could fund itself, said the FRC, which was not unreasonable at the time. The following events, and 
the clamming up of interbank funding, were not anticipated.
Harvey s destruction
Costs in
Specialist insurer Hiscox expects to receive net claims of $150m (£110m) relating to the impact of Hurricane 
Harvey, the first major hurricane to make landfall in the US in more than 12 years. Those claims, which were within 
the modelled range for such an event, are estimated as part of a wider insured market loss of $25bn, excluding 
what is covered by the National Flood Insurance Program. And investors await the further cost of Hurricane Irma, 
which should be announced when the impact of that storm is better known.
Tata s new steel deal
A Port Talbot reprieve?
India s Tata Steel has opened the way for a merger of its European operations with German steel manufacturer 
ThyssenKrupp, creating Europe s second-largest steel group after ArcelorMittal. A major hurdle to the merger was 
removed recently when Tata reached an agreement over its £15bn pension scheme. Naturally, steel unions and 
politicians are already calling for the merged entity to safeguard Welsh jobs when they go ahead with the merger. 
But with returns shrinking across the industry, scaling-up operations is the only way to compete globally.
22 September 2017
The great unwinding
The end of QE?
By the time this magazine has hit the newsstands we should know whether the US Federal Reserve is serious 
about unwinding quantitative easing (QE). It would represent an effective volte-face on what has been the greatest 
monetary experiment in US economic history. The efficacy of the QE programmes will be hotly debated by 
economists for decades, but equity investors probably aren t in any doubt as to its benefits. The only problem is that 
shrinkage of the Fed s balance sheet usually prefigures recession. Doubtless this will be uppermost in the mind of 
Janet Yellen.
Clock watching
Flights cancelled
Ryanair (RYA) is set to cancel between 40 and 50 flights every day for the next six weeks, with the aim of improving 
punctuality. This had fallen below 80 per cent in September due to a combination of more holiday allowance for its 
pilots, bad weather and strikes at air traffic control. This represents less than 2 per cent of the flights operated by 
the budget airline over the next six weeks and less than 0.5 per cent of passengers over the year. The cancellations 
are expected to cost Ryanair around  25m (£22.1m) and will be met in the second quarter.
Cancer breakthrough
NHS approval
Bristol-Myers Squibb s immunotherapy drug Opdivo has become the first of its kind to be recommended to treat 
NHS patients with lung cancer by the National Institute for Healthcare Excellence (NICE). The pharmaceutical 
group agreed a discounted price with the watchdog, meaning around 1,300 patients will receive the drug through 
the Cancer Drugs Fund. Both Merck (US:MRK) and AstraZeneca (AZN) have immunotherapy drugs approved in 
the US, but have yet to receive the go-ahead in the UK due to their high price.
Streaming power
Hulu wins Emmy
The streaming revolution, which has been snatching viewers from traditional TV channels for the past few years, 
has now claimed its first big award. Hulu, a digital TV service owned by Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast 
and Time Warner, won the coveted Outstanding Drama award at the Emmys for its version of The Handmaid s 
Tale. Hulu s victory on television s biggest awards night reflects the rising competition for audiences between 
traditional pay-TV companies and online services such as Netflix or Amazon.
Confidence has returned to the eurozone. Buoyed by improving economic indicators and a strengthening euro over 
the past year, the eurozone s key leaders are displaying more confidence than they have for some years. This is 
reflected by the growing bullishness in economic sentiment figures from the bloc. Such confidence is likely to be 
further boosted by expectations that Germany s chancellor Angela Merkel will be returned to office for a fourth term 
when the country heads to the polls this week. Opinion polls point to Ms Merkel s Christian Democratic Union 
winning the poll and forming another coalition government with the popularity of anti-EU parties waning, leaving 
both France and Germany headed up by pro-EU leaders and setting the eurozone on course for further economic 
and political integration once Brexit is resolved.

Air Berlin's insolvency provides capacity opportunities
Air Berlin's insolvency provides capacity opportunities

The failure of Air Berlin presents an opportunity for other airlines to fill the void in capacity the German airline has 
left behind
Julia Faurschou
Overcapacity in the airline industry could soon drag on the yield of listed operators, and so the exit of struggling 
airlines is good news for the overall market. The latest to go is Germany's second-largest airline Air Berlin, which 
filed for insolvency after its largest shareholder, Etihad, pulled its financial support. The German government has 
stepped in with  150m (£136m) in emergency funding so that the airline can continue with flights it had already 
scheduled. Once this has been achieved other airlines will have the opportunity to step in to fill the void in the 
German market.
Germany s largest airline Lufthansa could be in prime position to scoop up more capacity in the German market. 
This has Ryanair (RYA) concerned. It has lodged a competition complaint with the German Bundeskartellamt and 
European Commission over what the budget airline feels is  manufactured insolvency  and an attempt between the 
German government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin to divide the insolvent airline s assets. Ryanair alleges that this 
excludes major competitors and ignores EU competition and state aid rules.
Shares in easyJet (EZJ) and Ryanair are up 4 per cent and 3 per cent respectively since the news of Air Berlin s 
insolvency, suggesting that the market believes this presents an opportunity for the budget airlines to expand their 
presence in Germany. Any moves to fill the void left by Air Berlin are not likely to be immediate since both easyJet 
and Ryanair have scheduled their aircraft for the upcoming winter season, according to analysts at Liberum.
Economically inefficient airlines supported by state finance have fuelled the problem of overcapacity in airlines, and 
so analysts at Liberum called the failure of uncompetitive operators a positive for the industry. The last time Air 
Berlin posted an underlying pre-tax profit was in 2006, so its insolvency should not come as too shocking. Continue 
to hold both easyJet and Ryanair.

UK-listed airlines are dealing with the prospect that a hard Brexit could leave them without the right to operate 
flights in continental Europe
Julia Faurschou
Aviation regulation is up in the air as the clock ticks closer to March 2019 when the UK will leave the European 
Union. This deadline has airline bosses worried about what will happen if, in the case of a hard Brexit, the UK 
leaves without a deal. Some have warned that if an agreement is not reached in time, flights between the UK and 
the EU would be grounded. While this may unintentionally solve the immigration question, it could be bad news for 
the airlines  shareholders.
One of the perks of being part of the EU is the ability to operate flights freely between member states through the  
Open Skies  contract. The UK will no longer be part of any EU-related agreements post Brexit and, while many 
other industries can revert back to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, the aviation industry has no historical 
agreement to fall back on.
London-listed airlines that have routes within the EU also run into the issue of ownership laws. Any airline that 
wishes to operate flights within the EU must show that it is owned and controlled by EU nationals with the 
requirement to prove that at least half of its shares are held by EU-member citizens.
Taking flight
Carolyn McCall may be on her way out the door from her role as chief executive of easyJet (EZJ), but she has left 
the company well prepared to deal with whatever outcome may arise from Brexit negotiations. The budget airline 
received its Air Operator Certificate from Austria s Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology last 
month, which allows it to establish easyJet Europe. This new subsidiary is headquartered in Vienna and gives 
easyJet the ability to continue to operate flights both across Europe and domestically within European countries 
after the UK has left the EU, regardless of the outcome of discussions about a future UK-EU aviation agreement. 
The people and planes that will operate the new easyJet Europe business are already all in and employed in 
Europe.
Airlines take on Brexit
This air operator certificate will cost easyJet up to £10m over the next three years once all the aircraft registration 
costs have been totalled up, and around £3m of this has already been paid during the 2017 financial year. Close to 
a third of easyJet s network of flights fly within and between EU member states, so it looks set to be well worth the 
cost over the long term.
Experiencing turbulence
Ryanair (RYA) chief executive Michael O Leary isn t one to mince his words, and the UK s departure from the EU 
has been no exception. Mr O Leary s disdain for Brexit began well before voters cast their ballots, and he was a 
vocal  remain  campaigner. Now that the UK is in the process of figuring out on what terms it will proceed with its  
divorce , the chief executive has warned that Britons  summer holidays in 2019 could be on the line if a concrete 
deal isn t in place before the end of 2018 (this being when airlines start scheduling and selling flights for the 
following summer period).
A spokesperson for Ryanair said it  remains concerned at the uncertainty which surrounds the terms of the UK s 
departure from the EU  in March 2019. While the company continues to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU 
Open Skies agreement, the representative cautioned that should the UK leave, there may not be sufficient time or 
goodwill on both sides to negotiate a timely, replacement bilateral agreement. This could result in the disruption of 
flights between the UK and the EU. If Ryanair doesn t have certainty about the legal basis for operating flights by 
the autumn of 2018, it could be forced to cancel flights and move some or all of its UK-based aircraft to continental 
Europe as of April 2019. The spokesperson added that the airline has  contingency plans in place  and will adapt to  
changed circumstances in the best interests of our customers and shareholders .
International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) has a slightly more optimistic approach to Brexit plans. A representative 
said IAG will continue to comply with the relevant ownership and control regulations but added that the company is  
confident that a comprehensive agreement between the EU and the UK will be reached . IAG believes it is in 
Europe s interest to have a  fully liberalised aviation agreement  as 900m travellers fly between the two regions 
each year.  That not only benefits customers but creates jobs and wealth across the continent,  the spokesperson 
said.
Wizz Air (WIZZ) is not letting the prospect of a hard Brexit get in the way of its plans to add a million seats to its UK 
operations on top of the million it added during its last financial year to March. As the largest low-cost airline in 
central and eastern Europe, the company is thinking that weak sterling could attract higher numbers of tourists to 
the UK to take advantage of their improved spending power. Chief executive Jozsef Varadi said at the full-year 
results in May that there were  no signs of demand weakness  on flights to and from the UK. Although weak sterling 
resulted in a  17m (£15.4m) negative translation effect this was largely offset by the rest of the group s diverse 
network of routes, and thus revenue.
The Budapest-based airline is taking the reverse approach to easyJet when it comes to Brexit. It s planning to apply 
for a British air operator certificate so that it can continue to fly between the UK and the EU in the case that no 
aviation deal is reached in time. Mr Varadi thinks it looks  increasingly likely  that Brexit negotiators will not come to 
an early agreement on aviation, and so the British air operator certificate should help protect the interest of both 
Wizz Air s customers and investors.
Ownership headwinds
IAG chief executive Willie Walsh took a more cautious tone when he met with the European Parliament last month. 
He urged members to overhaul EU ownership laws so that UK nationals would still count towards the 50 per cent 
threshold of shares that have to be owned by EU nationals. The owner of British Airways and Aer Lingus would not 
reveal the proportion of shares held by EU citizens not including UK shareholders, but estimates from analysts 
suggest that the group would certainly fall below the threshold. This could force the group to spin off part of the 
business or to buy out up to a quarter of its shareholder base.
Ryanair could also face problems with ownership requirements. Currently, the airline s share ownership is split 54 
per cent EU owned and 46 per cent non-EU, although 20 per cent of the total figure is in the hands of UK 
Airlines take on Brexit
shareholders. A spokesperson stated that if UK owners of Ryanair s shares are no longer designated as EU 
nationals, then the company may have to take action to make sure that they can meet compliance. Ryanair s 
articles of association give the company certain powers to ensure that the number of ordinary shares held by non-
EU nationals does not reach a level that could jeopardise the airline s entitlement to continue to hold a licence that 
enables it to carry on business as an air carrier. Some institutional shareholders may decide to re-domicile their 
investments, but others could risk becoming disenfranchised and, in some instances, be required to sell their 
shares.
Favourites
Shares in Wizz Air are up 23 per cent since our buy tip in June. Of all the airlines discussed, Wizz Air looks best 
placed to deal with Brexit. The airline looks set to benefit from its exposure to central and eastern Europe as weak 
sterling could encourage more people in the region to travel to Britain. Wizz Air is continuing to increase its 
capacity, with available seat kilometres up 20 per cent during the 12 months to March, while continuing to fill more 
seats. At 2,842p, the shares are trading at 14 times forward earnings, which still looks reasonable given the scope 
for growth.
We also like IAG for its diversified and large-scale business. It owns a number of different airlines across all 
budgets, from British Airways to Aer Lingus to Vueling. The company reports in sterling and so benefited from the 
more favourable exchange rate at the last set of results. And yet, at 619p the shares are trading at just six times 
forward earnings, a clear discount to other London-listed airlines.
Outsiders
At the end of last month, we downgraded our view on easyJet after it said higher capacity could begin to weigh on 
yield. Analysts have also warned that free cash flow could fall as the airline looks to spend more on capital 
expenditure, which could put the dividend at risk. The 16 times forward earnings rating make the shares look 
expensive compared with their historical valuation and to sector peers. We see little reason to offload the stock 
altogether, but this looks like a pricey entry point.
Ryanair looks like it could be in a similar situation. In May, management warned that the combination of weak 
sterling and excess capacity in Europe could push down average fares by between 5 and 7 per cent in the year to 
March 2018. Ryanair is focusing on routes in Europe and has reined in expansion plans for the UK in light of Brexit, 
although this could be a waste of effort if it is eventually forced to ground flights on the continent. Its shares are 
trading at the upper end of their historical valuation at 15 times forward earnings, so this looks like an expensive 
entry point for would-be investors.
The analyst's view
As an airline that derives a large proportion of its revenue from the EU, the issue of Brexit is clearly a very 
significant one for easyJet. At the time of the referendum, the company said it was confident that Brexit would not 
have a material impact on its ability to deliver long-term sustainable earnings growth, but Carolyn McCall said she 
was keen for the UK to remain part of the single EU aviation market.
Since then, the company has taken sensible steps to address the uncertainty over the final negotiated deal between 
the UK and the EU by getting approval for an air operator certificate and an airline operating licence in Austria, 
which will enable it to continue flights between EU countries and within them. The shares have outperformed the 
market so far this year, in common with several of its peers, although the main challenges faced by easyJet relate 
more to excess capacity, fierce competition and the uncertainty created by the departure of Dame Carolyn than 
Brexit.
But it s true that, at the moment, there is some uncertainty. The company is looking for a chief executive and faces 
fierce competition from Ryanair. It should worry to a lesser extent about IAG   it doesn t face the same level of 
rivalry given the latter s legacy business. EasyJet does have a strong balance sheet, but issues with the cost base 
and capacity will make progress a little more difficult in the near term. Once it has a new chief executive in place, 
Airlines take on Brexit
the capacity plans are made clearer and the competition threat manifests one way or another, the investment case 
should be stronger.
Ultimately, there s a limited amount easyJet can do to address Brexit at this time, which only increases the level of 
uncertainty and risk. Once we get a feel for where the wider political negotiations are going and how final 
agreements will look, it will be easier for investors to understand how the business will act moving forward.

Concerns are growing that increasing capacity could weigh on yields for easyJet and Ryanair
Julia Faurschou
Budget airline easyJet (EZJ) may soon encounter some turbulence. Outgoing chief executive Carolyn McCall has 
warned that increased capacity could soon put pressure on yields during the group's latest quarterly update. This 
excess capacity is an issue across the wider industry, as airlines tend to increase the number of seats they offer 
when lower fuel prices makes it cheaper to operate flights.
<div id="company-widget-ezj-lse" class="company-widget company-widget--inline" data-ticker="EZJ:LSE </div>
Jozsef Varadi, chief executive of fellow low-cost airline Wizz Air (WIZZ), expressed similar sentiment to Ms McCall 
earlier this week when he warned that airlines tend to compete away the benefit of lower fuel prices with extra 
capacity. As a result he is  cautious on the prevailing yield environment  during the second half of the year. 
Management at Ryanair (RYA) also stated in May that average fares during the year to March 2018 could fall by 
between 5 and 7 per cent, due to a combination of weak sterling and continuing excess capacity in Europe.
easyJet has continued to increase capacity this year. It was up by 9.5 per cent during the third quarter to 24m 
seats. The number of passengers carried increased by 10.8 per cent to 22.3m with a load factor of 93.1 per cent, an 
improvement of 1.1 percentage points. Revenue per seat was up 2.2 per cent at constant currency and total 
revenue increased 16 per cent to £1.4bn, although this was largely aided by Easter falling during the third period of 
this year.
At 1,271p, shares in easyJet are creeping towards the top end of their historical valuation, at 15 times forward 
earnings. This looks expensive given the warning on yields, and analysts expect that leverage and free cash flow 
could take a hit at the expense of higher capex. This could pose a threat to the dividend. The fact the company has 
secured its future operations in Europe with an Air Operator Certificate in Austria is positive. However, at this lofty 
valuation   especially compared with peers Ryanair (RYA) and Wizz Air (WIZZ)   we re going to shift to hold for now. 
Ryanair appears to be in a similar situation as easyJet where increasing capacity could eventually weigh on yield, 
so also a hold. However, we reckon Wizz Air is well positioned to exploit the long-term prospects for central and 
eastern European air travel, keeping us bullish on that budget airline.

The airlines' boss is due to take up the role at ITV in early 2018.
Megan Boxall
Carolyn McCall s biography on the easyJet (EZJ) investor page proudly announces that under her tenure the airline 
has reached the landmark of carrying 70m passengers a year. ITV s (ITV) shareholders will no doubt hope she can 
obtain similar customer numbers in her new role. Britain s biggest commercial broadcaster has appointed Ms 
McCall as its new chief executive following Adam Crozier s departure in June.
The change at the top comes at a time of rising pressure in the media world. Demand for TV advertising space   at 
one time ITV s biggest revenue contributor   has plummeted in recent years as companies turn increasingly to 
online ad platforms such as Google and Facebook. Mr Crozier has done his bit to leave the company in good shape 
in this time of uncertainty. During the past few years he has dramatically reduced the company's reliance on TV 
advertising by bulking up its portfolio of production companies and investing in the online ITV Hub.
<div id="company-widget-itv-lse" class="company-widget company-widget--inline" data-ticker="ITV:LSE </div>
But still the future looks uncertain. In May ITV predicted that net advertising revenue in the first half   the financial 
results of which are due to be announced next week   could fall by 9 per cent. Broker Numis expects 2017 pre-tax 
profits to drop 5 per cent to £805m due to that decline and the investment demands of running multiple production 
companies.
But Ms McCall is no stranger to corporate challenges. Her first six months as the boss of easyJet saw airlines 
grounded due to a volcanic ash cloud, a massive spike in the oil price and an airline traffic controller strike. Today, 
with a market capitalisation of £5.7bn, easyJet is £4.1bn larger than when she joined in 2010.
Once disparagingly described as  a media luvvie  by Michael O Leary, the boss of budget airline rival RyanAir, Ms 
McColl s experience atop a major UK media company seems to have served her well in obtaining the ITV role. 
Before joining easyJet she was the chief executive at the Guardian Media Group and led the paper s major 
rebranding in 2005. Her experience within the FTSE 100 is also enviable, having held a position on the board of 
Lloyds (LLOY), New Look and Tesco (TSCO).
ITV investors hopeful as easyJet boss grabs top job
We have been impressed with Mr Crozier s diversification strategy and think Ms McCall is inheriting a strong 
company, well positioned to manage the future challenges of broadcasting. Although takeover speculation has been 
somewhat allayed following the appointment of such a high calibre chief executive, we still think ITV s shares look 
materially undervalued at 11 times forward earnings. At 175p, buy.

The airline chief executive has sold 4m shares just shy of an all-time share price high
Nothing presents a time to sell like a share price peak. Ryanair's (RYA) outspoken chief executive, Michael 
O'Leary, sold 4m shares in the budget airline worth a total of 72m (GBP63.5m) on 6 June. At 1,800A a share, the 
chief executive sold at just under Ryanair's all-time share price high of 1,826A reached on 31 May this year. Mr 
O'Leary is still the third-largest Ryanair shareholder, behind HSBC and Fidelity Investments, owning close to 4 per 
cent of shares after this disposal.
Last month, the airline announced a 600m share buyback programme, but warned that there could be "significant 
disruption" to flights between the UK and Europe after the UK leaves the European Union (EU). In light of this, 
Ryanair has started to shift its strategy away from UK-bound flights to focus on its routes in Europe, despite Mr 
O'Leary's shortlived claims that the airline would stop flying to the continent if the aviation industry was not given a 
special post-Brexit deal.

Lower average ticket prices were offset by growth in traffic and lower unit costs, but management continue to be 
wary of the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the EU
The Brexit fears voiced by Ryanair (RYA) management aren't reflected in the budget airline's full-year numbers - at 
least not yet. Although average fares were 13 per cent lower at 41 (GBP35.65) per flight, this was offset by 13 per 
cent growth in traffic to 120m passengers, giving an "industry leading" load factor of 94 per cent. Operating profits 
were 5 per cent up on the previous year-end at 1.53bn, helped along by an 11 per cent reduction in unit costs, 
although comparable earnings came up short due to a 318m gain in 2015-16 on the disposal of Ryanair's 29.8 per 
cent stake in Aer Lingus.
The airline has started to shift its strategy to focus on European routes after it reined in its expansion plans in the 
UK following the EU referendum. Over the year Ryanair launched 206 new routes and 10 new sites at primary 
airports on the continent, while its Polish chartered airline, Ryanair Sun, is set to start operating in summer 2018.
Liberum expects pre-tax profits of 1.66bn in the year to March 2018, giving an EPS of 119.5A, compared to 1.5bn 
and 106.8A in FY2017.

FTSE 100 takes a dip
The FTSE 100 hits a bit of turbulence as IAG shares are hit by the BA debacle. Read this morning's Trader column 
Read this morning's Trader column from Nicole Elliott.
KEY STORIES:
In an interesting turn of events, shares actually rose in stamp dealer Stanley GibbonsSGI) this morning after the 
group confirmed one of its subsidiaries, Mallet & Co had divested a 25 per cent stake in Masterpiece London, the 
operator of the annual Masterpiece London art and antiques fair for GBP1.4m. This cash windfall will go towards 
paying down group debt. On the 9 May 2017, the group had previously said it would retain its interest in 
Masterpiece despite wider disposals being made across the group.
Shares in petrol forecourt retailer ApplegreenAPGN) rose 4 per cent off the back of a positive trading statement this 
morning, where bosses confirmed the group was off to a good start for the 2017 financial year. Sales are growing 
strongly in Ireland and margins are holding up too, while food sales in the UK are also accelerating. New sites have 
opened in the Ireland, the UK and also the New England area in the US. The group sealed the statement by 
confirming plans to pay a maiden dividend worth 1.25p a share in June 2017.
More passengers and cheaper unit costs acted as tailwinds for RyanairRYA), pushing pre-tax profit up 5 per cent to 
1.53bn in its full year results. Although the average fare price fell by 13 per cent to 41, traffic grew 13 per cent to 
120m customers giving an "industry leading" load factor of 94 per cent. The budget airline also announced a 600m 
share buyback programme, which suggests that cash generation going forward it expected to continue in strength. 
Shares fell around 1 per cent in early trading.

Markets are becalmed as the UK pulls the Brexit trigger
Markets fell back marginally as investors took the official triggering of Brexit in their stride. Click here for The Trader 
Nicole Elliott's latest thoughts.
IC TIP UPDATES:
Just a days after news broke about it losing control of South West trains franchise to rival company 
FirstGroupFGP), StagecoachSGC) has revealed a 1.6 per cent improvement in UK rail like-for-like revenues over 
the 40 weeks ended 4 March 2017. Reported separately, revenues from Virgin Rail Group's West Coast franchise 
jumped 5.3 per cent, although the division was up against seriously weak comparative figures from last year. The 
bus divisions aren't faring as well, with revenues down 0.9 per cent in London and 1.7 per cent regionally. Sell.
Sticking to travel, CarnivalCCL) reported first quarter results yesterday, where EPS of 38 cents comfortably beat 
consensus forecasts of 32 cents. Management went on to say that cumulative advance bookings for the remainder 
of 2017 were "well ahead of the prior year at considerably higher prices", prompting analysts at Numis to raise EPS 
forecasts for the current year by 5.5 per cent. Buy.
KEY STORIES:
It's a momentous day as Prime Minister Theresa May signs on the Brexit dotted line. This has prompted bosses at 
budget airline - and European short-haul operator - RyanairRYA) to "call on the UK Government to put aviation at 
the forefront of its negotiations with the EU and provide a coherent post-Brexit plan, or risk leaving the UK without 
any flights to or from Europe for a period from March 2019, when it exits the EU." Whilst that might sound a tad 
dramatic, Ryanair points out that the UK is set to leave Europe's "Open Skies" system, meaning the government 
will have to either negotiate a bilateral agreement with the EU to allow flights across Europe to continue, or else 
revert to "historical WTO rules", which do not cover aviation, "thereby raising the distinct possibility of no flights 
between Europe and the UK for a period from March 2019".
OTHER COMPANY NEWS:
Stagecoach, Carnival, Ryanair & more
A pre-close update from TUI travelTUI) comes just one day after close rival Thomas CookTCG). The company 
appears to be in a "solid position" according to City analysts in reference to summer bookings, which are up 4 per 
cent on last year, with prices up 5 per cent. Hotels and resorts are trading well overall, while new ships have driven 
continued cruise growth. Management has also reiterated FY17 guidance for underlying cash profit growth of at 
least 10 per cent.
Shares in Sanne GroupSNN) were flat following release of its full year results. Pre-tax profit jumped to GBP15m 
from GBP2.4m in 2015 due to strong momentum from new business opportunities throughout the year. The group 
is continuing to invest in operations both inside and outside the EU to insulate it against the effect of Brexit.

Equities are up a little
Shares in London have started the week positively, but without any great conviction. Click here for The Trader 
Nicole Elliott's latest take on the global markets that matter.
IC TIP UPDATES:
Our November tip Ithaca EnergyIAE) is 10 per cent to the good this morning, after the North Sea producer's board 
agreed to an all-cash offer from shareholder Delek. Though at a fairly modest 11 per cent premium to Friday's 
closing price, the deal gives Ithaca an enterprise value of $1.24bn, and is towards the top-end of a scale drawn up 
by one of Ithaca's independent financial advisers. With the shares 48 per cent up on our most recent call, we think 
the offer is fair. Accept.
Shares in Gem DiamondsGEMD) are 7 per cent down after the LetAeng mine recovered fewer large special 
diamonds than expected. That was despite a surge in production in the quarter, and the recovery of 26,438 carats. 
As previously announced, the future of Ghagoo is currently being considered, given the weak prices achieved. Our 
recommendation is also under review.
Fourth quarter production at coloured gemstone peer Gemfields'GEM) Kagem operation was also weak. The 
Zambian emerald mine saw a large decline in both average grade and total carats in the period, owing to the varied 
nature of the mineralisation and a lower-grade zone, which also pushed up unit operating costs by 47 per cent 
against the 2015 comparative. The performance of Montepuez and Faberge were both stronger, however. Our buy 
call is also under review.
The European Commission won't be standing in the way of the all-cash offer for FyffesFFY) from Swordus Ireland. 
The company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation, made the 2.23 (GBP1.87 at the time) offer 
back in December, which represented a 49 per cent premium to the closing price on 8 December. The move came 
even as the fruit company had in recent months become acquisitive itself, snapping up Canadian mushroom 
business Highline Produce for 99m. The Swordus takeover is now expected to complete on 16 February.
KEY STORIES:
Ithaca Energy, Randgold, Ryanair & more
With the gold price opening above $1,220 an ounce this morning, Randgold ResourcesRRS) shares are trading 4 
per cent higher this morning. The positive market reaction also has something to do with full-year results, which 
promised a 52 per cent hike in the dividend to $1 a share. Though this falls short of the monster pay-out announced 
by Centamin last week, this leaves plenty of cash on the balance sheet, which should be further supported by 2017 
guidance for 1.25-1.30moz at $580-$630 per ounce.
The diverging fortunes of the share prices of RyanairRYA) and its main rival easyJetEZJ) in the past six months 
certainly illustrate the narrative of how the pair have fared of late. The Irish group's 20 per cent rise stands in stark 
contrast to its opponent's almost 10 per cent drop but Ryanair has stuttered slightly this morning. The stock is down 
nearly 2 per cent as pre-tax profit dropped 4 per cent to 106m. The battle for bums on seats explains it as while 
load factors - a measure of how full on average its planes were - rose 2 per cent to a record 95 per cent, average 
fares slumped 17 per cent to 33. Thankfully, the group's well-known cost-cutting abilities remained steadfast, with 
costs excluding fuel dropping 6 per cent. This will be a key factor in management holding its full-year guidance.
Buying growth seems to be the order of the day for consumer goods at the moment. Just days after Reckitt 
BenckiserRB.) announced a major deal, nutrition company GlanbiaGLB) has scoffed two acquisitions for 99m. The 
deals will be funded out of existing debt and will fit into the company's performance nutrition segment, which 
includes products such as whey protein. The businesses, US-based Amazing Grass, which has a portfolio of 
organic and non-GMO brands in the plant based nutrition categories, and Body & Fit, a Dutch online direct-to-
consumer business, will be marginally earnings accretive this year.

With fares under pressure and the price of oil slowly rising, picking an airline to back can be difficult
The government's decision to give the semaphore flags to Heathrow airport's expansion comes at a point when 
airlines are under intense pressure. The price war on the runway looks just as vicious as that which continues to 
unfold in the supermarket aisles and issues such as terrorist incidents have weighed on demand in the recent past, 
while fears about what Brexit might mean are creating jitters about the future.
Whether or not you think Heathrow is the right place to expand the country's airport capacity, one thing analysts 
strongly agree on is that expansion is needed.
Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy, said while there might be political and economic concerns about the runway, he 
said there was "no economic case for not having it". He pointed out that China was in the process of building 25 
new airports, so one runway in the UK was hardly moving the dial on a comparative basis. Putting the political 
hurdles aside, extra runway space in the UK sounds like a positive thing for airlines, but investors need to ensure 
they're backing the stocks that will still be flying when the tarmac in west London is actually laid.
A
Clipping their wings
The key obstacle for airlines at the moment appears to be managing their costs. Of course, this is always important, 
but with fares seemingly stuck in a downward spiral it's imperative airlines tighten their belts one way or another.
The drop in oil prices means fuel costs have fallen in the past 18 months and this benefit is largely locked in due to 
the airlines' hedging policies, which have secured the majority of their fuel costs at a set rate for the forthcoming 
year at least. Given the price of oil is out of airlines' control, investors need to watch which way ex-fuel costs are 
moving, as well as the revenue per available seat metric. Load factors are also important as, should airlines 
overexpand, they could be flying planes with too few passengers on them to make the trips cost-effective.
A
A
An eagle eye on costs will keep airlines on course
Davy's Mr Furlong reckons Ryanair (RYA) will be the winner when it comes to controlling costs among the discount 
brethren calling it the "cost leader in Europe and probably the world". With the legacy carriers, he views 
International Consolidated Airlines' (IAG) return on invested capital story as credible. He said the latter group was 
benefiting from its acquisition of Irish carrier Aer Lingus, which brought with it more primary airport slots and further 
transatlantic capacity.
Ryanair's unit costs fell 5 per cent excluding fuel in its latest results, better than easyJet (EZJ) which published 
results this week showing ex-fuel costs had fallen by 1.1 per cent on a constant currency basis.
A
Navigating Brexit
Another major factor for investors to consider is how airlines are using their capacity. Supply in the European short-
haul industry continues to outpace demand and yet broker Liberum expects capacity to grow by roughly 8 per cent 
this winter.
Regardless of whether Heathrow's expansion remains on track, the biggest near-term issue is balancing the supply 
of flights from the UK given the uncertainty the EU referendum vote has caused.
Moves have already been made by some of the low-cost players, with Ryanair reducing its planned second-half UK 
capacity growth from 12 per cent to 5 per cent while Wizz Air (WIZZ) said in July that it would halve its planned UK 
growth. Broker JPMorgan Cazenove said Ryanair was the best-positioned airline for the long term, with its UK 
exposure below all other European low-cost carriers, except for Wizz Air. IAG and easyJet, on the other hand, were 
described by the broker as "the most heavily geared airlines to the UK". Indeed, easyJet marginally revised up 
capacity growth to 9 per cent for the 2017 financial year and is expanding its UK footprint as well as launching a 
European operating company to protect itself from any negative fallout from the Brexit negotiations.
While Wizz is benefiting from increasing interest in flying to and from eastern Europe, there is a small but growing 
concern that it might not have it so easy if other airlines turn their attention to similar geographies. JPMorgan 
Cazenove said Wizz could face "potential rising interest in eastern European markets from Ryanair, depending on 
the impact of Brexit".
A
Cloudy outlook?
The steep fall in the pound in recent months has increased speculation that the UK could be a tougher market 
where outbound tourism is concerned. This is because sterling weakness has made it more expensive to holiday 
across both the Channel and the Atlantic.
But data from the Office for National Statistics suggests demand could well be stickier than people perceive. This is 
a sentiment often echoed by airline chief executives following terror attacks - effectively that demand might take a 
near-term hit but will recover as the desire to travel trumps any insecurities about flying.
The ONS said there had been an upward trend in the number of people visiting the UK since late 2012, but this 
"has not been driven by the value of the pound, which had also been on an upward trend until earlier this year".
A
A
Instead, the increase in visitors has been largely driven by a rise in the number of visitors from Europe, including 
countries that recently joined the EU. "There have also been large proportional increases in visitors from China and 
other emerging economies who now have the money to travel further afield," it added.
An eagle eye on costs will keep airlines on course
And encouragingly for the airlines, there is no data yet to suggest the popularity of 'staycations' - UK citizens having 
holidays in good old Blighty - has risen. The number of UK residents travelling abroad has "continued to rise in line 
with the trend seen since the economic downturn in 2008", the ONS said. This may be because there is no 
evidence (at this stage), to show a fall in the pound has had an effect on air fares or the prices of package holidays.
This comes back to the issue of cost. If an airline can reduce costs by a greater amount than it is reducing its fares, 
then it can likely continue to perform even as the outlook regarding Brexit looks more uncertain than usual.
A
Favourites
We recently upgraded our view on the eastern European-focused Wizz Air due to its low exposure to the UK and 
strong links to countries where air travel is becoming increasingly popular. Our take on Ryanair is more tempered, 
although this is largely a valuation-based decision seeing as we're confident about it operationally. We also 
continue to back easyJet which, in spite of a tough 2016, has a solid balance sheet and provides investors with a 
more certain income stream thanks to its dividend.
Outsiders
Exeter-based airline Flybe (FLYB) would have to be our big outsider. The group recently lost its chief executive and 
is intent on increasing capacity in spite of the supply landscape and its previous problems with overexpansion. It is 
also opening a new European base in DAsseldorf, which seems brave in the short term given strong industry 
capacity growth but may turn out to be a useful Brexit hedge.
Capacity growth across the European short haul industry continues to outstrip undisturbed demand growth (ie 
before price stimulation), most probably due to low fuel prices. We believe capacity is set to grow by around 8 per 
cent this winter, with easyJet indicating industry capacity growth on its routes is slightly faster at 9-10 per cent.

The discount airline hasn't had it easy in 2016, but management is taking bold steps to make sure things aren't as 
tough next year and beyond
It's been a year easyJet (EZJ) will largely want to forget. It suffered an almost GBP240m hit to pre-tax profit due to 
strikes and weather-induced cancellations, as well as the negative effects of sterling's drop against the dollar and 
euro. This also explained the steep drop in operating profits of more than a quarter. The 6.9 per cent fall in constant 
currency revenue per seat could also not be offset by the 1.1 per cent cost reduction per seat on the same basis. 
But chief executive Carolyn McCall said the larger 186-seat A320neos it has on order will have a 13-14 per cent 
cost per seat benefit compared with the existing 156-seat A319s.
While 2016 was tough, easyJet is looking to take control of 2017. Nearly half its growth will be in the UK this 
financial year, cementing its number one position here as rivals Ryanair (RYA) and Wizz Air (WIZZ) cool UK growth 
plans. And Ms McCall announced the group had nearly completed the process of launching a Europe-based 
operating company securing the 30 per cent of its network that operates wholly between or within continental 
countries. This should shield it from any negative Brexit implications.
Ms McCall said setting up the new base would not be expensive and said many airlines have several operating 
licences, citing Lufthansa which has 14. The EasyJet headquarters will remain in the UK though.
The group is targeting a flat cost per seat excluding fuel by 2019, something it has already made good strides 
towards. Around GBP95m worth of costs have been removed thanks to its 'easyJet Lean' initiative. Ms McCall said 
the group would be using its scale to get better deals at airports where it is either the dominant or a major player. 
There will also be an organisational review but this is doesn't mean job cuts, according to Ms McCall, who said up 
to 900 jobs could be added over coming years.
Analysts at Liberum expect pre-tax profit of GBP399m in the year to September 2017, leading to EPS of 82.5p, 
from GBP495m and 109p in FY2016.

Equities have enjoyed a solid start to the day in London
Despite signs that the Trump rally might be running out of steam over the pond as bonds sell off sharply, London 
equities are in favour again this morning. Click here for The Trader Nicole Elliott's latest thoughts.
IC TIP UPDATES:
VodafoneVOD) grew organic service revenues by 2.3 per cent in the six months to September, driving organic cash 
profits up 4.3 per cent to 7.91bn (GBP6.87bn). The telecoms giant also grew its broadband customer base by 
675,000. However, it tweaked its full-year guidance downward; it expects organic growth in cash profits of 3 to 6 per 
cent, to between 15.7bn and 16.1bn. Our recommendation is under review.
It's been an exceptional year for easyJetEZJ) for all the wrong reasons. Poor weather conditions has led to a 
bumper amount of cancellations and this, alongside strikes and terrorist incidents mean it's been a turbulent time. 
But the shares are up this morning, suggesting there is optimism surrounding its planned capacity expansion in the 
UK - at a time when rivals Ryanair and Wizz Air are curtailing their UK growth - and its decision to launch a 
European based operating company. Details on this are scant at present, but it will effectively enable easyJet to fly 
between mainland European countries and within them come what may in regards to Brexit negotiations. Revenue 
per seat decreased 6.4 per cent to GBP58.46, greater than the 4.6 per cent fall in cost per seat including fuel. Chief 
executive Carolyn McCall said the group's plan to upgrade its fleet would push cost per seat down as the planes it 
has on order are bigger than their existing jets. Buy.
Despite the forewarnings from a recent trading update, interim results from Hayward TylerHAYT) have not 
impressed investors who sent the share price down almost 10 per cent in early trading. Overall group revenues are 
up, but a higher cost base has taken a chunk out of the bottom line. Management do however expect a much 
stronger second half and have therefore left full year forecasts unchanged. Buy.
A trading statement from Card FactoryCARD) has sent shares there up 1 per cent this morning despite an 
"unspectacular" third quarter, to use brokerage Peel Hunt's words. Total sales growth of just 4.4 per cent doesn't 
give the market much confidence over like-for-like growth, but we like to see the group is still highly cash 
generative. That gives us some reassurance over future special returns. With Christmas just around the corner, we 
remain bullish for now. Buy.
Vodafone , easyJet , FirstGroup & more
The American parts of bus and rail company FirstGroup'sFGP) business did the heavy lifting this half-year. Its First 
Student business secured average price increases of 7.3 per cent for its school bus service contracts and its First 
Transit business secured some important contract wins. The latter division was held back slightly by reduced 
activity in the Canadian oil sands region but earnings from the US translated handsomely into the now weakened 
sterling. In the UK, demand for buses continues to fall and while passenger numbers on its rail business rose 
marginally, major infrastructure upgrade works hampered the performance slightly. Buy.
Shares in TalkTalk TelecomTALK) slid 9 per cent in morning trading after the cut-price telecoms provider indicated 
that full-year cash profits would be towards the lower end of its GBP320m to GBP360m guidance. Core sales slid 4 
per cent in the six months to 30 September, but headline cash profits jumped 44 per cent to GBP130m. We are 
reviewing our recommendation.
Audiences haven't been perturbed by the EU referendum fallout - or perhaps it has even encouraged attendance as 
people seek to escape reality. A trading update from CineworldCINE) shows revenue up nearly 11 per cent on a 
constant currency basis with box office and retail revenue - read sweets, drinks and now coffee thanks to its 
Starbucks tie-up for the latter - performing strongly. Family titles such as 'The Secret Life of Pets', 'Finding Dory' 
and 'The BFG' performed well and 'Bridget Jones's Baby' "exceeded expectations". The group opened seven 4DX 
screens and two IMAX screens, suggesting it continues to believe investing in bigger and better technology is worth 
it. Buy.
KEY STORIES:
The shareholders who keenly scanned BTG'sBTG) interim results for news of varicose veins treatment Varithena 
will have no doubt been disappointed. Granted, sales of the highly anticipated treatment are up, but only to 
GBP1.7m. That shouldn't take away from the progress the group has made in the first six months of the 2017 
financial year; in interventional medicine revenue is up 39 per cent, helping lift overall group sales by a tenth at 
constant currency.
A return to revenue growth in Enterprise Inns'ETI) northern pubs has helped the group record virtually flat revenue 
in what has been a busy year. Management has continued to dispose of unwanted pubs and this is likely to 
continue at a pace of roughly 200 per year for the next five. Adjusted pre-tax profit was also flat at GBP122m but on 
a reported basis, a reduction in one-off costs and lower debt costs thanks to a successful refinancing earlier this 
year, mean the reported figure swung to a GBP75m profit compared to a similar sized loss last year. The value of 
the group's estate has also been revised upwards for the first time in a few years. Cash generation remains decent 
and management will continue the share buyback scheme it recently started.
OTHER COMPANY NEWS:
Shares in discount chain B&M European Value RetailBME) have jumped 3 per cent off the back of interim results 
from the group this morning. Group revenues soared 18.9 per cent, buoyed by a slew of new store openings, while 
like-for-like growth nudged up 0.2 per cent given the planned impact of those new sites. Group adjusted profit 
before tax increased by 17.2 per cent to GBP77.9m, and the dividend rose proportionally by 18.8 per cent to 1.9p a 
share.
Premier FoodsPFD) shares are also up this morning on the back of interim numbers. That's interesting given that 
losses are widening and dairy, wheat and and sugar prices are bound to rise following the recent referendum. The 
group's main currency exposure is towards the Euro. However, management is confident it will make full-year profit 
forecasts, while it claims the integration of the Nissin Foods merger is well underway. All eyes are likely to be on 
Hong Kong based activist investor Oasis Management, which recently upped its stake in the food producer.
Revenues at RhythmOneRTHM) slid 12 per cent in the six months to 30 September, but the video-advertising 
specialist's adjusted cash loss narrowed by nearly two-thirds to $2.5m (GBP2.0m). Sales of core products grew 6 
per cent $67m, or four-fifths of total turnover, as the group shifted its focus to mobile, video and programmatic 
products.

The budget airline is focusing its growth on mainland Europe in what is another sign of companies protecting 
themselves against the potential for a messy EU exit
Investors hunting for tangible effects of the referendum result beyond Marmite should look at budget airline 
Ryanair's (RYA) results. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said its planned 12 per cent expansion in the UK would 
now fall to 5 per cent. The weak pound has also led the group to trim full-year profit expectations to 1.30bn-1.325bn 
(GBP1.17bn), a 75m cut. The UK represents 26 per cent of revenue, but that's likely to shrink as the group shifts its 
focus to Italy, where tourist taxes have been cut, and to Germany and Belgium, where competitors are feeling the 
pinch from deflationary fares.
The squeeze in air fares is a game Ryanair is only too happy to participate in. Average fares fell 10 per cent to 50 
but crucially management was able to cut costs by 10 per cent too - if fuel costs are included. This is where the Irish 
carrier seems to be beating peers, evident by the fact it now operates in more primary airports (105) than secondary 
ones (95). The group said primary sites are incentivising the airlines to use them as incumbents struggle.
Analysts at Davy expect pre-tax profit of 1.48bn for the year to March 2017 leading to EPS of 105A, compared with 
1.72bn and 116A in FY2016.

Ryanair pivots away from UK
GBP1=1.12
It should be noted that pre-tax profits rose during the half-year if a 317m exceptional gain from the Aer Lingus sale 
in 2015 is excluded, suggesting that Ryanair is fighting fit in these tough conditions. It's also well hedged in terms of 
fuel costs, but net cash is falling partly due to its thirst for buybacks. The shares' 13 times forward earnings rating 
looks fair value to us. Hold.

Investors should avoid companies that, like Donald Trump, refuse to adapt
Donald Trump recently hired Stephen Bannon, the chairman of Breitbart News, as his new campaign chief. 
Breitbart is notorious for propagating conspiracy theories, railing against the Republican establishment and political 
elite, and fervently supporting Mr Trump's controversial views. The appointment will disappoint many Republicans 
who were hoping their presidential nominee would temper his rhetoric and broaden his appeal ahead of the general 
election. "I don't want to pivot," said the real estate tycoon in a recent interview. "I don't want to change. If you start 
pivoting, you're not being honest with people...I am who I am."
Mr Trump's refusal to pivot is understandable: he fended off more than a dozen rivals for the Republican nomination 
by spouting contentious things and feeding people's fears of immigrants and Islamic terrorists. But his obstinance 
threatens to weaken his chances of securing the White House: his hateful speeches and outrageous proposals 
resonated with white, working-class male voters during the primaries, but they've alienated minorities, women and 
many prominent Republican donors and politicians. Although changing tack could make the billionaire seem 
dishonest and disingenuous, doubling down looks to be a sure-fire way to lose the election.
Corporate question
Company executives often face similar dilemmas: do they stand by an existing business model, which may be 
doomed to fail, or transform their operations and potentially estrange customers and employees and scrap years of 
hard work? Many simply lack the energy, flexibility and appetite for risk to even attempt a transition. But there are 
several recent examples of businesses changing course in response to new challenges or opportunities.
After announcing a 'pivot to Asia' last year, banking giant HSBC (HSBA) has invested heavily in China and other 
parts of the region to capitalise on mounting demand for finance. It earned about 84 per cent of its pre-tax profit 
there last year, up from 70 per cent in 2013. Similarly, low-fare airline Ryanair (RYA) reacted to the Brexit vote by 
announcing it would concentrate on EU rather than UK airports over the next two years. And US networking 
behemoth Cisco (US:CSCO), which made its fortune selling cables and routers, has reacted to flagging hardware 
sales by switching its focus to cyber security software, data storage and internet-connected devices.
Success stories
The power of the pivot
There are plenty of famous pivots throughout business history. More than a century ago, Warren Buffett's Berkshire 
Hathaway (BRK.A) manufactured textiles, mobile phone giant Nokia (Fi:NOK1V) was a paper mill and video-game 
titan Nintendo (Jp:7973) produced playing cards. Sony (Jp:6758) went from selling rice cookers to cameras and 
televisions, while WPP (WPP), the world's largest advertising company, began life as Wire and Plastic Products, a 
manufacturer of wire shopping baskets. More recent cases include Twitter (US:TWTR), created after the threat of 
iTunes forced podcast network Odeo to kitchen-sink its business, and photo-sharing platform Instagram - owned by 
Facebook (US:FB) - which began as a location check-in and gaming app called Burbn.
But perhaps the best examples of pivots come from beauty products group Avon (AVP) and chewing gum brand 
Wrigley, now owned by chocolate giant Mars. Their founders, travelling salesmen of books and baking powder 
respectively, realised the free perfume and packs of gum they handed out to customers were more popular than 
their main products.
Fictional echo
Pivoting has become such a popular concept in business circles that it's been the subject of satire. Silicon Valley, a 
TV comedy that follows the highs and lows of a software start-up called Pied Piper, devoted an entire plotline to one 
of its founders frantically attempting to pivot. When the company's data-compression technology seems destined to 
fail, he corners strangers to ask them if they'd use an app that can attract rats or buy a GPS device to track their 
kids. "I can follow your child anywhere and there is nothing you can do to stop me," he gleefully tells the perturbed 
parents of a newborn baby.
The term 'pivot' risks becoming yet another corporate buzzword, but it remains a crucial business tool. Executives in 
Mr Trump's situation - where a certain approach has paid dividends - must be willing to take a step back and 
consider if changes are needed, or they risk losing ground. Those that can recast their companies to meet their 
customers' needs and see off rival upstarts deserve significant credit. Investors should favour businesses that make 
careful, calculated shifts in strategy over those that can't or won't adapt to market forces. The fate of the free world 
may not be at stake, but a company's ability to pivot can determine its long-term survival and the scale of its 
shareholder returns.

Our take on some of the biggest stories of the week
Openreach ruling
BT spared split
UK telecoms regulator Ofcom has proposed that the Openreach division of BT be run as an independent, legally 
separate entity within the telecoms titan, complete with its own board, branding and control of its budget allocation. 
The shares responded positively, potentially because a forced split could have been suggested. BT had been 
accused of underinvesting in Openreach but just a day before the ruling, BT chairman Sir Mike Rake told BBC 
Radio 4 it was "absolutely willing to form an Openreach board that will have an independent chairman, a majority of 
independent directors".
Exotic yield
EM debt rush
A global hunt for yield coupled with a post-Brexit shift in economic sentiment in favour of emerging markets has 
helped drive record inflows and fuel bumper returns. Emerging markets sovereign bond yields plunged to a record 
low 4.47 per cent this week, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices. The asset class has returned 5.7 
per cent year to date. Emerging markets debt funds have seen a record $9.4bn of inflows in the past week, 
according to EPFR data. The attraction has been augmented by the fact yields on $13 trillion of developed market 
sovereign bonds yield less than zero.
Outflows continue
Aberdeen hit
A drop in assets under management of more than GBP1bn within its property division contributed to Aberdeen 
Asset Management's 13th consecutive quarter of outflows. Europe's third-largest listed fund manager saw net 
outflows of GBP8.9bn in the three months to 30 June with the Brexit vote unsettling those in bricks and mortar. The 
group suspended transactions in its UK property fund for a week which gave unitholders the opportunity to cancel 
their sell order if they wished or to sell at a price "more reflective of the short-term market conditions".

Brexit fallout
Ryanair UK chop
While millions of people around the globe have been ignoring the real world around them in a bid to catch Pokemon 
in a virtual version of it, a statement from Nintendo has snapped them out of their trance.
The company said the impact of the phenomenon that is the Pokemon Go game would have a "limited" impact on 
its earnings given the franchise is owned by an affiliated company in which it has a 32 per cent stake - - something 
Investors Chronicle highlighted in a piece last week warning investors about the likely limited impact on Nintendo's 
bottom line. The shares dropped nearly a fifth on the back of the announcement, as can be seen in the chart.

World markets trended upwards after a productive G20 gathering in Chengdu, China
UK investors awoke to early gains across most of the world's major markets, perhaps reflecting relief that the 
leaders of the world's 20 largest nations have committed to shoring up global economic growth in the face of 
significant uncertainty. Following a parliamentary inquiry, a report has been published today about Sir Philip Green 
and his role in the downfall of BHS. Read The Trader Nicole Elliott's morning update here here.
IC TIP UPDATES:
The newsflow is coming thick and fast with bookie William HillWMH), which just days after its chief executive James 
Henderson suddenly left the company, has been approached by rivals 888888) and Rank GroupRNK). The duo 
have not made a formal offer, so details are scant, but they believe there is "significant industrial logic in the 
combination, through consolidation of their complementary online and land-based operations". William Hill has said 
it will listen to any offer but that it is "not clear that a combination of William Hill with 888 and Rank will enhance 
William Hill's strategic positioning or deliver superior value to William Hill's strategy which is focused on increasing 
the group's diversification by growing its digital and international businesses". That said, shareholders in WMH will 
be aware that the company has been a wallflower at the gamblers' dance, which has seen many of its rivals tie the 
knot in major deals. The stock is up 9 per cent this morning, highlighting the market's preferred outcome. Buy.
Investors sent shares up 2 per cent in response to a second-quarter operational update from Atalaya MiningATYM), 
after the Spanish copper producer announced a 15 per cent increase in ore processed, at consistent grades. 
Atalaya added that it was continuing to evaluate funding options to support its short-term working capital needs, 
ahead of a production ramp-up. Buy.
Falcon Oil & GasFOG) stock rose 5 per cent this morning, following news that it had successfully re-entered and 
cased the Amungee NW-1H horizontal well and spudded the Beetaloo W-1 vertical well in the Beetaloo Basin in 
Northern Australia. The explorer's chief executive, Philip O'Quigley, said the ongoing drilling programme "could go a 
long way towards proving up the resource potential of the Beetaloo Basin". We remain optimistic about Falcon's 
carried, long-term potential. Buy.

A subsidiary of CohortCHRT) - Marlborough Communications Ltd - has been awarded an MoD Airborne Tactical 
Communications Support Contract valued at up to GBP7.7m. The contract is to provide support to certain specialist 
equipment and includes options covering additional development activities. Buy.
Speedy HireSDY) shares rose 2 per cent this morning following news that the hire company's largest shareholder 
Toscafund has requested a shareholder meeting to remove the company's Executive Chairman Jan Astrand and 
install turnaround specialist David Shearer. Hold.
AbcamABC) has continued to drive the top line upward in the second half of its financial year, reporting that 
revenues are likely to be up a fifth on last year. The growth has been particularly strong in the new RabMAB 
division - sales were up 29 per cent, far exceeding expectations. Non-catalogues products and Chinese operations 
have both been towards the upper end of forecasts. Buy.
KEY STORIES:
The cuts in airlines' UK growth plans keep coming after low-cost carrier RyanairRYA) said it would pivot its growth 
away from UK airports and "focus more on growing at our EU airports over the next two years". It added that in 
winter it would cut capacity and frequency on many London Stansted routes "where we are already significantly 
ahead of our multi-year traffic growth targets". No routes would close though, it added. Elsewhere, its first-quarter 
performance appeared robust, with passenger numbers up 11 per cent to 31.2m and pre-tax profits up 4 per cent to 
256m (GBP214m). Perhaps one of the key metrics was its costs, which even excluding fuel fell 4 per cent thanks to 
various factors including cheaper financing, discounted airport growth deals and a weaker sterling, which was partly 
offset by slightly higher staff costs as five-year pay deals kicked in across its 84 bases and headcount rose in line 
with fleet growth.
Pork and chicken producer CranswickCWK) has seen its revenues for the three months to 30 June rise 11 per cent 
compared to the same period last year. Volumes rose 12 per cent as lower input costs fed through to customers. 
Encouragingly, export volumes to Far Eastern markets were 60 per cent ahead of the same period last year, 
reflecting both ongoing demand from the region and increased output from the group's two primary processing 
facilities. Management said the integration of Crown Chicken, which it acquired in April for GBP39m, is progressing 
well. Elsewhere, the group has sold its small sandwich business for GBP15m to IC buy tip Greencore (GNC). At 
Cranswick's full-year results in May, the group pencilled in a GBP4.6m impairment in the sandwich division due to 
the loss of a sizeable contract although it had replaced this with a similar-sized one.
Image Scan (IGE), the AIM-listed specialist supplier of X-ray screening systems to the security and industrial 
inspection markets, has received another significant order for its ThreatScanA-LS1 portable X-ray system. The new 
contract, at just over GBP750k, is of a similar size to the order announced in June and comes from the same Asian 
territory.
Shares in CityFibreCITY) climbed 2 per cent after the UK fibre optic infrastructure specialist revealed brisk trading in 
the first half of 2016. It inked contracts with a total initial value of GBP53.8m - more than double the value of deals 
signed in 2015. It also ended the period with 49 relationships with service providers such as Level 3 and SSE 
Enterprise Telecoms, compared with 33 a year ago.
Gross written premiums climbed 18 per cent at specialist insurer HiscoxHSX) in the first half of 2016, propelling pre-
tax profits up 52 per cent to GBP206m. Hiscox Retail contributed the most to group profits, while Hiscox USA grew 
strongly and Hiscox London Market benefited from expertise in niche areas and new types of business.
OTHER COMPANY NEWS:
Perhaps wary of investors cashing out after the payment of a $22m (GBP16.7m) maiden dividend, Randgold 
ResourcesRRS) chief executive Mark Bristow this weekend remarked that the gold miner's geologists had "defined 
the potential for additional resources below the Tongon pit" in CAte d'Ivoire, in addition to some near-mine 
satellites, which could collectively extend the mine's life. The shares fell 2 per cent this morning, along with a slight 
decline in the gold price.

Rough diamond prices may have been down by an average of 6 per cent in the last year, but Petra DiamondsPDL) 
can't be faulted for trying to make up the difference in production. The precious gems miner produced 3.7 million 
carats in the 12 months to June, 16 per cent up on 2015 and above previously stated guidance. Despite a sharp 
increase in net debt and operational capital expenditure, investors were buoyed this morning by plans to increase 
this year's production by as much as 30 per cent.
Amur MineralsAMC), the nickel-copper sulphide explorer based in far-east Russia, has announced an update to its 
definitive feasibility study for the Kun-Manie project. The company now believes it can sustain 15 years of

Experts are hurredly trying to gauge the impact the UK's vote to leave the EU will have on consumer confidence
Consumer-focused stocks took a major hit as experts scrambled to try to understand how confidence will be 
impacted in the aftermath of the UK's decision to leave the EU.
Bicycle retailer Halfords (HFD) dropped 22 per cent in early trading whlie Restaurant Group (RTN), a stock which 
had already been under pressure, fell up to 30 per cent before regaining some ground.
In terms of the airlines, Easyjet (EZJ) is down 17 per cent and Ryanair (RYA) has dropped 10 per cent on fears the 
pound's large drop could put some holidaymakers off. British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines 
(IAG) has also said this morning the vote to leave means it expects the pace of profit growth to slow this year. The 
shares are down 20 per cent at the time of writing.
"Following the outcome of the referendum, and given current market volatility, while IAG continues to expect a 
significant increase in operating profit this year, it no longer expects to generate an absolute operating profit 
increase similar to 2015," the group said.
The British Retail Consortium's chief executive Helen Dickinson, said: "Keeping the cost of goods down for 
consumers and providing certainty for businesses must be at the heart of the Government's plans for life outside of 
the EU."
The body added that without clarity, "retailers, other businesses and hence the economy will suffer from a 
prolonged period of uncertainty".
Ms Dickinson added retailers should be "prepared for the possibility of significant swings, particularly in the 
exchange rate and consumer confidence".
Chris White, head of UK equities at Premier Asset Management, said it was likely defensive stocks and 
multinationals would come to the fore while "financials and both consumer and industrial cyclicals will come under 
pressure".
Consumer confidence could see 'significant swings'
And broker RBC said the impact of imported inflation as a result of the pound's fall could lead to price rises from 
spring 2017, which he said "may be difficult to pass on in what's been a promotional deflationary environment 
recently".
"We see a risk that like-for-like volumes will reduce more, given spend on clothing has been underperforming other 
bigger ticket and leisure related parts of consumer spending," the broker said.
"Assuming that retailers raise prices we see a risk of a more intense promotional environment, particularly as 
increased online competition, Black Friday week promotions and internet price transparency for consumers have all 
led to recent net price deflation in the sector."
But RBC said several consumer staples stocks it covers should be relatively unaffected given the low amount of 
revenues they derive from the UK.
One stock it follows, it added, could even be a beneficiary - Diageo (DGE).
"That's because 24 per cent of its sales are of Scotch, with production and storage costs incurred in the UK - - so 
these costs should come down," it said.
"But only 6 per cent of sales are in the UK. So Diageo, and to a lesser extent Pernod Ricard, should see a 
meaningful transactional benefit.
"At the other end of the scale is Britvic (BVIC), where we estimate about two-thirds of sales are in the UK - - so it 
will likely be significantly more affected than the rest of the staples sector."

Shares in the largest online travel agent for hostels have taken an oversized hit after marginally softer trading.
Almost half of the bookings made through leading online hostel-booking company Hostelworld (HSW) are for rooms 
in Europe, so the reverberations on the travel industry from the Paris terror attack have been bad for business and 
the company's share price. Sentiment took another knock this month on news that Ryanair plans to enter the 
accommodation booking market. But for now Hostelworld, which was founded in Dublin in 1999 and floated on the 
main list in November last year, is king in this niche growth market, offering over 200m beds a night in more than 
33,000 hostels in over 170 countries. And while an advertising drive is currently weighing on margins, the 
company's cash generation, healthy balance sheet and strong long-term growth prospects means the forecast 9 per 
cent dividend yield for next year may not prove as much of a long-shot as the rating would suggest. Indeed, chief 
executive Feargal Mooney and non-executive director Andy McCue were willing to take a near-GBP200,000 bet on 
the shares at the end of last month at 181p, and star UK income manager Neil Woodford has also been adding to 
his fund's stake, which now stands at over 22 per cent.
While Hostelworld cannot control travellers' reactions to terror attacks, the things it has power over are moving in 
the right direction. For example, higher-commission bookings through its Elevate pricing programme - which gives 
hostel owners better website positioning - rose to 21 per cent of the total last year, from 15 per cent. Furthermore, a 
ramp-up in ad spending seems to be paying off with Hostelworld bookings rising 21 per cent in the second half of 
2015. And the campaign has been successful enough for management to declare that investment as a percentage 
of net revenue will come in below the previous guidance of 45-50 per cent. The company is also benefiting from 
expansion in Asia and now counts South Korea as its seventh biggest market by nationality of traveller.
A

Nevertheless, last month Hostelworld revealed that weakness in Europe means bookings are expected to be 
marginally down this year. Looking to the long term, though, some major growth opportunities exist as booking 
moves online and the trend continues for more frequent travel by the younger demographic Hostelworld targets. 
The company should also benefit from broad-based improvements to the level of hostel accommodation worldwide. 
And the fragmented nature of hostel ownership puts it in a strong position to benefit from its scale.
Time to book Hostelworld's crazy yield
And news earlier this month of the potential entry of Ryanair into the accommodation space in October caused 
further share price weakness. However, we think the Ryanair threat has been overstated, not least because it is 
already a competitor through an existing partnership with Booking.com - the second largest online travel agent for 
hostels.

The market tends to harshly punish recent floats that disappoint. That certainly seems the case with Hostelworld 
trading at just nine times 2017 forecast earnings and offering a crazy yield backed by its policy of paying out 70 to 
80 per cent of post-tax profit. We think European travel weakness should prove temporary while the competitive 
threat from Ryanair could well be a red herring. Buy.

Stocks and sterling regain significant ground from their recent dips as the chances of the UK leaving the EU reduce
Equities and sterling appeared to be breathing a sigh of relief in the final hours before voting in the EU referendum 
began, even though some polls put the Leave camp marginally ahead.
At the time of going to press, the FTSE 100 stood at 6274, an impressive recovery from the sub-6000 level it hit on 
13 June, and the pound had risen against the US dollar to $1.47 from a low of $1.41 on 14 June.
This seemed at odds with some data, though, including results from the Financial Times' poll of polls, which gave 
Leave a 45/44 point lead, and some figures from the bookies. Data supplied to Investors Chronicle by 
Oddschecker, which aggregates 26 major bookmakers, showed the percentage of individual bets placed on leave 
had hit 66.4 per cent in the 24-hour period from 11.40am on 21 June against 33.6 per cent for Remain.
But the total amount of money backing the UK staying in the EU represented 81.2 per cent of all bets, meaning 
punters believing in the status quo are more confident or have greater amounts of disposable income. The largest 
single bet in the past week for Remain was GBP10,000 compared with Leave's GBP1,000. The bookmakers 
themselves are also more confident that Remain will win given the odds on a vote in favour of staying in the EU are 
shorter than those to leave, according to Oddschecker.
Elsewhere, some 80 per cent of the GBP1m-worth of bets placed through Betfair's gambling exchange immediately 
after the Wembley Arena debate on 21 June backed Remain. The odds of a Brexit shortened last week, but there is 
now only an implied 24 per cent chance of the Leave camp prevailing, Betfair said.
A major PR assault by the Remain camp, including Ryanair (RYA) chief executive Michael O'Leary offering 
GBP19.99 fares to Europe ahead of voting and citing membership as a reason air fares had fallen in recent years, 
may well have swung it.
Equity futures appeared to have spiked in recent days too, suggesting investors are predicting a relief rally. Such a 
move may well be replicated elsewhere, especially given Danske Bank this week predicted a vote to leave the EU 
would potentially tip countries such as Finland and Denmark back into recession.
Markets rally in final straight before EU referendum
UBS also said the FTSE 100 index could fall to its lowest point since 2011 - below 5000 - if the country voted to 
leave.
A host of financial advisers told Investors Chronicle sister title FTAdviser.com that they had refrained from trying to 
position portfolios in a way that predicted the outcome, suggesting it was better to remain invested than try to guess 
the result.

Capacity is growing more than in previous years among the airline's competitors as their fuel hedges unwind
Even excluding the near-400m (GBP310m) disposal of its Aer Lingus shareholding its Aer Lingus shareholding, pre-
tax profits rose more than two-thirds as Ryanair (RYA) became the first airline to clock 100m international 
passengers in a calendar year. The number of bums on seats rose by nearly a fifth to 106.4m, pushing load factors 
up to 93 per cent. Fares were on average 46.67, down 1 per cent, which along with the carrier's 'Always Getting 
Better' customer service programme seems to be enticing flyers.
But while the peak summer season has, on average, 2 per cent more bookings than this time last year, fares 
continue to fall. The company said pricing would likely be softer in its first and fourth quarter given neither have 
included the Easter break, and capacity additions in Europe are higher than in previous years "as hedged 
competitors enjoy falling oil bills". Bosses expect average fares to fall some 7 per cent this year. This should be 
mitigated by the fact that its fuel costs are 95 per cent hedged at $62 per barrel in the 2017 financial year - far better 
than the $90 per barrel hedge in FY2016. Flight cancellations hit 500 in the period thanks to terrorist events in 
Brussels and strikes on the continent thanks to terrorist events in Brussels and strikes on the continent.
Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald expect pre-tax profits of 1.7bn for the year to March 2017, leading to adjusted EPS of 
115.8A, compared with 1.72bn and 115.6A in FY2015.

The outlook of further deflation and flat load factors isn't particularly enticing, and it's our belief that the shares' 12

impressive income profile. Hold.

Equities have rebounded after an iffy start
Equities began the day uncertainly but have since rebounded into positive territory. Click here for The Trader Nicole 
Elliott's latest views on the markets.
IC TIP UPDATES:
Unlisted bookied Betfred has chosen online gambling business GVCGVC) to drive its presence on the internet. The 
10-year agreement will see Betfred's online business migrated onto GVC's platform on an exclusive basis. The deal 
shows management at GVC clearly have ambition given they are still integrating recent acquisition Bwin Party. It 
also shows the growing importance of having a strong internet presence - Betfred is largely known for its circa 
1,400-strong retail estate. Buy.
Mexico-based lithium miner Bacanora MineralsBCN) has raised GBP7.7m in a placing of shares and warrants, in a 
deal with asset management giant BlackRock. The financing, which can be extended to GBP10m if the placing 
warrants are exercised, has priced the new stock at 79p. But the announcement helped to push up Bacanora's 
share price by 5 per cent this morning. We remain long-term buyers.
KEY STORIES:
As part of its strategy of disposing non-core units, De La RueDLAR) said it has sold a business which provides cash 
sorting machines to major lenders for GBP3.6m. The Basingstoke-based firm said it had sold its Cash Processing 
Solutions unit to a company owned by the UK private equity firm Privet Capital.
RestoreRST) confirmed that trading is proceeding satisfactorily and that the integration of Wincanton Records 
Management, acquired in December 2015, is proceeding well. The document storage specialist also confirmed the 
expected improvement in margins in its core business, together with news that net debt has reduced significantly 
this year.
There's certainly some jet fuel behind the numbers at budget airline RyanairRYA) this morning with revenues up 16 
per cent to 6.5bn (GBP5bn) which has pushed adjusted pre-tax profits up more than two thirds to 1.4bn - which 
moves up to 1.7bn when the proceeds of its Aer Lingus sale to International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) is 
GVC, De La Rue, Ryanair & more
taken into account. Management said the airline was roughly 2 per cent better booked for the peak summer months 
compared to last year but at lower fares. It added pricing would likely be softer in Q1 and Q4 given the lack of 
Easter and the fact capacity additions in Europe are "higher than in previous years as hedged competitors enjoy 
falling oil bills". It expects average fares to fall roughly 7 per cent this financial year. It's likely this outlook which has 
kept the shares flat in early trading.
The chips have fallen the way of Stride GamingSTR) investors this morning as the company announced its maiden 
interim dividend. The stock has risen some 43 per cent in the past year on the back of strong performance for the 
London-based business. Net gaming revenue rose by a fifth to more than GBP21m which helped push adjusted 
cash profits up 30 per cent to GBP5.6m. The shares rose nearly 7 per cent in early trading.
OTHER COMPANY NEWS:

Airline stocks fall further than market with some dropping more steeply than in the wake of the November Paris 
attacks
Travel stocks were knocked by the terrorist blasts at a Belgian airport and metro station this week with some falling 
further than after the Paris attacks last year.
Airline stocks including Easyjet (EZJ), Ryanair (RYA) and British Airways and Iberia owner International 
Consolidated Airlines (IAG) took the brunt after falling more steeply than the broader market on the day, while rail-
related stocks including Go-Ahead (GOG) and National Express (NEX) were also dented.
The attacks, firstly at Brussels' Zaventem airport and then the city's Maelbeek station, killed dozens of people 
collectively and came just a day after Belgium's interior minister, Jan Jambon, warned that jihadis could be plotting 
a counter attack in response to the arrest last week of Salah Abdeslam, a suspected participant in November's 
Paris attacks.
On the day of the incident, Thomas Cook (TCG) had issued a trading statement which, alongside the news of the 
attacks, sent the stock down as much as 6 per cent. The group acknowledged it had only sold 90 per cent of its 
winter holidays and that its summer breaks were only 40 per cent sold, albeit at higher prices.
It's likely 2016 will be a tough year for the travel sector
Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said: "We know that customers want a summer holiday but we can see that 
some are leaving it later to book this year as they consider their options."
The company last year had to rebalance capacity due to higher demand for flights to Spain in the wake of bombings 
in the Turkish capital Ankara in October. There is now the possibility that it - and its rivals - might have to further 
adapt fleet locations and prices to encourage demand.
Belgium is an important market for other airline groups too, including Tui AG (TUI), which said last year it would aim 
to roll out its brand in the country as part of a multi-location plan in the coming years. It had also decided to follow 
government advice and halt flights to Tunisia from Belgium, following a terror attack in the African country last year.
Terror strike hits travel sector
The European nation is also firmly on the radar of budget carrier Ryanair, which in its last update said Belgium was 
one of the markets it was looking to "grow capacity quickly" in.
The latest attacks, alongside the ongoing debate about whether to leave the EU and a weak sterling making foreign 
trips for domestic travellers potentially more expensive, make it likely 2016 will be a tough year for the travel sector.
John Wyn-Evans, head of investment strategy at Investec Wealth & Investment, said those travel and leisure 
groups with a greater exposure to the UK might be the ones to benefit from a cheaper pound, with British travellers 
more likely to take holidays at home.

Why Buffett's scorn for airline investments looks short-sighted in the case of the UK low-cost carrier
Warren Buffett is famous for his dislike of airline investments. "If a capitalist had been present at Kittyhawk back in 
the early 1900s, he should have shot down Orville Wright," he is fond of saying. It may seem imprudent to disagree 
with the Sage of Omaha - particularly at a time when terrorist attacks risk curbing public appetite for travel. But I am 
increasingly convinced it is worth making an exception for easyJet(EZJ).
The key reason is that the low-cost airline industry in Europe still has scope to take market share from the old 
national monopolists. This trend is hardly new - which is why easyJet's shares have generated an almost fivefold 
return since flotation in 2000 - but nor is it mature. The Luton-based carrier controls about 20 per cent of the UK and 
23 per cent of the Swiss markets. But elsewhere in Europe the airline scene looks more like it used to in Britain, 
with incumbent flag-carriers still dominant.
Take Germany: a recent survey on behalf of Liberum, the stockbroker, found that consumers in Europe's largest 
economy rated local airlines - Lufthansa, its low-cost brand Germanwings and Air Berlin - well above easyJet and 
Ryanair for value for money. But as Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo points out, neither Air Berlin nor Germanwings 
are profitable operations, so their prominence may not be sustainable. The small corner of the market currently 
occupied by easyJet (with market share of 4 per cent) and Ryanair could therefore grow substantially. Having 
established a new base in Hamburg in 2014, easyJet increased its German capacity by 15 per cent during the year 
to September with the launch of 16 new routes.
The reason to buy shares in the orange-liveried airline founded in 1995 by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, rather than 
those of its Irish rival, boils down to valuation. Relative to expected profits, easyJet's shares trade at a discount both 
to their own trading history and to those of Ryanair - as the graph below shows. It is hard to come up with a 
convincing explanation for why this is the case.
So what could go wrong? In a 2002 interview with the Telegraph, Mr Buffett cited three problems with airline 
investments: high fixed costs, strong labour unions and "commodity pricing".
In the case of easyJet, it is easy to dismiss the point about labour unions, which have been an advantage to the 
low-cost carriers in their battle with legacy operators. On fixed costs Mr Buffett has a point. UK airlines have been 
able to increase their profits dramatically over the past three years by filling up their planes in an environment of 
Time to fly with easyJet
strengthening demand. But those gains would reverse just as dramatically if consumer and business sentiment took 
a turn for the worse.
However, my base assumption is that the low-cost carriers will be bigger in five years' time than they are now. 
Market share gains at the expense of the legacy European flag-carriers, and some structural growth in demand in 
line with past trends, should - on a five-year view - trump the vagaries of the business cycle. For the same reason I 
am not too worried about temporary disruptions as a result of the weather, traffic-control strikes or terrorist attacks 
such as we have seen this year. Volatility is par for the course for airline investing, but it is not incompatible with 
growth.
What Mr Buffett called commodity pricing is a more deep-seated problem. The low-cost carriers owe their success 
to the weakening of consumer ties to establishment brands like British Airways. But the same trend exposes them 
to vicious competition on price. This is particularly true when airline backers - such as the United Arab Emirates' 
Etihad Airways, a key shareholder in both Air Berlin and Italian flag-carrier Alitalia - have a high tolerance for losses. 
EasyJet expects revenues per seat to dip in its financial year to September 2016 as airlines compete to pass falling 
fuel costs on to their customers.
Yet capacity growth funded by strong operating cash flow will still drive bottom-line growth. The problems of a 
commoditised product will only really come to the fore when the market share gains that have fuelled the low-cost 
carriers for the past two decades peter out. That point still looks a long way off. Meanwhile, easyJet's shares look a 
steal on 11 times forward earnings.

Margaret Lawson of SVM UK Growth explains why she invests in the budget airline
Margaret Lawson, co-manager of SVM UK Growth Fund (GB0032084708), believes the market doesn't fully 
recognise the long-term strength of budget airline easyJet (EZJ).
The company is one of Europe's leading low-cost airlines, operating on more than 600 routes across more than 30 
countries with a fleet of over 200 Airbus aircraft. It employs more than 8,000 people and flew more than 60m 
passengers last year.
"EasyJet's summer trading update highlighted the resilience of the company's offering and offered a solid rebuttal to 
those who claimed the company would struggle to compete with an aggressively expanding Ryanair (RYA)," she 
says. "Despite increasing its capacity markedly, easyJet still managed to deliver better-than-expected revenues per 
seat.
"The dismal August UK weather will also have provided a welcome boost, as rain-soaked UK customers booked 
last-minute flights to warmer and drier climates. While the company has pulled back on some routes and bases, 
notably Rome Fiumicino, this makes sense when easyJet can successfully redeploy its aircraft into more profitable 
areas.
"The arrival of new chief financial officer Andrew Findlay, meanwhile, who was formerly at Halfords(HFD), means 
the company has a fresh pair of eyes looking at the cost base of the group. While recent results show that easyJet 
has costs under decent control, the cost per seat gap with Ryanair suggests there are still some benefits to be 
realised. While easyJet's greater exposure to prime airports means it is unlikely to ever fully close this gap, we 
would expect Mr Findlay to be looking for areas that can be optimised further.
"With the company trading on a price/earnings ratio (PE) of 11.92, we believe the market is still not fully recognising 
the long-term strength of easyJet."
The last IC recommendation on easyJet shares was 'Buy' at 1,743p on 18 Nov 2015. We said "the company's track 
record in taking market share is superb the company's track record in taking market share is superb", and its PE 
ratio is lower than Ryanair's. As at 25 November, the shares were trading at 1,605p.

The budget airline has put hedges in place that should keep fuel prices low through to 2017
A strong first-half showing from Ryanair (RYA) was a given after it hiked full-year profit expectations by a quarter in 
September to between 1.175bn and 1.225bn, citing higher fares, solid passenger growth and lower fuel costs. This 
last point certainly helped during the period. The cost of operating its planes was flat year on year without fuel, but 
dropped 6 per cent including fuel. And the benefits should continue now that management has hedged 95 per cent 
of its fuel for the year to March 2017 at $62 per barrel.
The removal of unpopular charges as part of its 'always getting better' strategy seems to be having the desired 
effect. Passenger traffic rose 13 per cent to reach 58m customers, which, coupled with lower costs, helped push 
operating profit up a whopping 35 per cent to 1.26bn.
Oddly, the shares fell 4 per cent in early trading, but more than recouped those losses to finish the day up 3 per 
cent. Perhaps the market does believe management's new target for full-year passenger numbers of 105m, up from 
previous guidance of 104m and 16 per cent higher than last year's 90.6m. Between now and 2024, the company 
plans to buy 380 new Boeing 737 aircraft, with the eventual aim of carrying 180m passengers a year.
Prior to these results, analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove expected pre-tax profit of 1.36bn for the full year, leading to 
EPS of 89A, compared with 982m and 62A in FY2015.

These were strong numbers, and the company's net cash mountain paves the way for more special dividends like 
that due in November from the proceeds of the Aer Lingus sale. But landing slots in more primary airports increased 
route charges by 11 per cent, and staff costs were up 15 per cent, too. Above all, airline stocks are infamously 
subject to unpredictable shocks - leaving a rating of 15 times forward earnings looking fair. Hold.

Summer saw most airlines fill more planes, but what does the more turbulent final quarter have in store?
The uncertain UK summer weather usually means an exodus of Brits jetting off to near- and far-flung beach 
destinations for that vitamin D top-up. This is, therefore, a key time of the year for airline stocks and 2015 so far has 
been particularly fruitful. Trade was so buoyant at the end of August that most airline stocks recorded a jump in their 
share prices and easyJet(EZJ) revised up its full-year profit forecast to GBP675m-GBP700m, from GBP620m-
GBP660m with Ryanair (RYA) following suit shortly after with a 25 per cent rise in its full year profit expectations to 
between 1.175bn to 1.225bn.
But what do the final few months of the year - a traditionally more fallow period for the sector - hold for the airlines? 
It seems there are reasons for optimism beyond the obvious macroeconomic factors, such as the low oil price.
The legacy airlines are more unionised, they have people on full-time staff and will tend to have most functions 
operated in-house, such as ground handling
One key contributor to the bottom line during the final quarter is business travel. With the summer months a quiet 
time for business, activity is subsequently kick-started back into full swing to meet project deadlines before 
Christmas arrives. Out of the UK-based listed airline stocks, British Airways, owned by International Consolidated 
Airlines(IAG), dominates the business travel arena.
"The legacy carriers have a little less seasonality to them because they have good business traffic," said Gerald 
Khoo, an analyst at Liberum. "September through to December is one of the strongest periods for business travel 
as activity picks up after the summer lull." Mr Khoo said business travel only accounted for a small proportion of 
flights for budget operators such as easyJet and "probably always will".
In spite of this, he said budget carriers have other ways to battle the winter blues, including cost control. "The 
legacy airlines are more unionised, they have people on full-time staff and will tend to have most functions operated 
in-house, such as ground handling," Mr Khoo said.
"But easyJet and Ryanair outsource many of these functions and Ryanair makes use of contract crew, meaning 
they can better manage staff costs," he added.
Summer days, drifting away
Cantor Fitzgerald's Rob Byde also leaned the same way. He said IAG had already built in a "fairly positive trading 
scenario" to its full-year numbers and remained dependent on North Transatlantic flow. Even the addition of Aer 
Lingus, which the group recently bought, meant access to Dublin Airport but this "also [brings] cost inflexibility".
The broker has IAG on a sell and is much more bullish on easyJet following the company's profit target upgrade.
"I think the budget carriers will have a very good autumn/winter season," Mr Byde said. "We are seeing a recovery 
in the European economy, which is a positive in terms of people's propensity to fly, and while about 80 per cent of 
its fuel costs are hedged, there will still be some marginal benefit from the low oil price."
Mr Byde added that recent investor concerns, such as rising landing fees and crew costs, had been "more benign 
than most forecast".
More broadly for the whole sector, while there has been growth in the number of seats, the amount has been less 
than anticipated, which is good for yields.
Anand Date, a Deutsche Bank analyst, elaborated on this point, saying some of the airlines he had spoken to 
suggested capacity growth was in line with passenger demand.
"They could be wrong, but that is what they are saying," he said. "From the data I can see on capacity it does not 
look unreasonably high and more importantly looks like, at the margin, airlines are looking to trim capacity rather 
than increase the number of planes."
Research from Barclays suggests low-cost carrier growth "looks to be at its highest level for at least five years" as 
the likes of Ryanair and easyJet seek to become less seasonal, while some legacy airlines are "returning to growth 
this winter".
"In aggregate, we do expect the short haul capacity environment to see its fastest growth this winter since 2008 - 
but at an earnings level, the acceleration is vastly outweighed by the fall in the fuel price, and the short haul 
demand environment appears very strong," the authors said.
They added that November data suggested broadly similar north Atlantic growth to the peak summer, which could 
be positive for IAG given roughly 70 per cent of British Airways' traffic is to and from the US.
Another positive sign Deutsche's Mr Date pointed to for airlines was data from Barclaycard. He said the average 
transaction value for airlines was down 7.1 per cent year on year in February but that this had recovered to being 
flat in June and down only marginally in July and August. Given that flights are usually booked in advance, this 
gives Mr Date some confidence about passenger numbers in the early part of Q4.

Weak industrial data in the UK has done little to dampen market spirits.
Markets are in buoyant mood this morning after a volatile few weeks. The FTSE 100 is up to 6,251 as it continues 
to claw back losses from the back end of August. This is in spite of industrial output declining and exports slumping, 
according to data out this morning from the Office for National Statistics.
KEY STORIES:
Low-cost carrier Ryanair(RYA) followed in the footsteps of rival Easyjet(EZJ) by upgrading its profits on the back of 
a stronger-than-expected summer. The Irish group said profits would now likely be between 1.175bn to 1.225bn 
instead of 940m to 970m - a 25 per cent rise.
The airline attributed a 13 per cent rise in traffic in the first half alongside a 2 per cent rise in fares as factors which 
prompted the upgrade. It added traffic growth in Q3 would now likely be 15 per cent instead of the 13 per cent 
previously guided
Online fund and share broker Hargreaves Lansdown(HL.) might have seen pre-tax profits fall by 5 per cent to 
GBP199m but given the reasons - which are not a surprise - the market has rewarded the Bristol-based company 
this morning by sending its shares up nearly 5 per cent.
The group said its move to reduce client charges, lower interest on client cash, falling markets and its GBP4.4m 
contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme - the government's investor safety net - pushed profits 
lower. But client numbers rose to 736,000 while assets under administration surpassed GBP52bn.
And also in broker land, independent retail stockbroker Share(SHRE), which operates The Share Centre has taken 
on GBP78m of investment trust Isa assets from fund manager Henderson Global Investors.
The group said this amounted to 3,000 accounts and the effective date of transfer would be 11 December. The 
accounts are invested predominantly in Henderson's Managed Investment Trusts.
Specialist wealth manager and employee benefits business Mattioli Woods (MTW), has snapped up Preston-based 
rival Taylor Patterson for GBP8.3m. The group said Taylor Patterson's experienced management team would be 
retained following the acquisition, which it said would be earnings enhancing in the first full year of ownership.
Hargreaves Lansdown, Ryanair , Barratt Developments and more
The announcement came as Mattioli posted full year results with revenues up nearly 18 per cent to GBP34.6m with 
pre-tax profits rising just more than 3 per cent to GBP5.3m.
It still looks safe as houses at Barratt Developments (BDEV) as the fuel driving housebuilders seems like it will 
never run out. The company reported a 19 per cent rise in revenues and with the average selling price increasing to 
GBP262,500 its pre-tax profits rose a staggering 45 per cent to GBP565.5m.
While the company noted more than 90 per cent of its material costs were now fixed until the end of FY16 it did 
acknowledge an industry shortage of skilled subcontractors was the "largest driver of overall build cost inflation". 
We recently moved the company to sell based on the modest yield.
Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has suffered a hit to hopes of reviving its respiratory drugs portfolio 
after a clinical trial for one of its medicines showed its effects were "not statistically significant".
The UK drugmaker ran a study including nearly 16,500 people around the world with the hope that if it could prove 
the drug would have significant benefits. Had it done so, it would have been able to sell more of the Breo treatment 
for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or smokers' cough. GSK shares are down nearly 1 per cent 
but US-listed Theravance, which it ran the trial with, has seen its shares drop 14 per cent.
OTHER COMPANY NEWS
An own goal seems to have been scored at Goals Soccer Centres (GOAL) after it posted flat revenues and guided 
pre-tax profits would now be in the range of GBP9.3m-GBP9.8m, sending the shares down by a fifth in early 
trading.
It was facing a tough opponent in strong comparables thanks to the World Cup last year stoking football fever and 
the weather in the UK this summer appears to have led to more cancellations than hoped. Bright spots are the use 
of its app continues to rise and it hopes to add three more sites in the US alongside its existing one.
Half-year revenues jumped more than 600 per cent to more than GBP16,000 at Aim-listed Futura Medical(FUM) but 
shares have dropped nearly 5 per cent in early trading.
The group said it had made progress across its portfolio of products, "particularly in advancing our clinical 
programmes and in preparing for the international roll-out of CSD500, our novel condom". Futura added work to 
extend the condom's shelf life had gone well and expected it to meet its commercial partners' requirements.
Surgical and advanced woundcare specialist company Advanced Medical Solutions Group (AMS) posted an 11 per 
cent rise in revenues to GBP32.7m thanks mainly to its branded distributed range of products, which includes 
hernia mesh fixation device LiquiBand.
The group said the product had been performing strongly and had seen a "strong uptake by surgeons 
internationally", which the company said showed the "potential of our innovation".
Shares at mobile transaction company Monitise(MONI) have dropped a staggering 30 per cent this morning after 
full year revenues declines 6 per cent to GBP89.7m. The group said it had worked hard to manage costs with a 32 
per cent half-on-half reduction in underlying costs but it stil registered a GBP55.3m loss after tax - up from 
GBP43.7m last year.

Former deputy chief executive has jumped on board despite shares rising strongly in recent months.
The effects of oil's price slump and Europe's weak currency as a pull for continental tourists has clearly helped 
Ryanair (RYA) of late. And in spite of the 90 per cent rise in its share price just since October, non-executive board 
member Michael Cawley still wants to board. The airline's former chief operating officer and deputy chief executive 
now owns 775,588 shares - or 0.057 per cent of the company.
The group posted a bumper 66 per cent leap in annual profits in recent months and with its 'Always Getting Better' 
customer experience programme still being heavily invested in, passenger numbers could continue to rise from the 
90.6m they hit in their results posted in May. The company also has more planes on order and is selling its stake in 
Aer Lingus(AERL) to British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines (IAG). The holding in its Irish rival 
had been bought to make sure the business had exposure to primary airports, but Ryanair has made good ground 
in gaining space at more major airports.

The owner of British Airways posted robust half-year numbers ahead of its imminent takeover of Aer Lingus
Cost cuts and plunging fuel charges put a rocket under first-half operating profits at International Consolidated 
Airlines (IAG). The strong performance came as the owner of British Airways and Iberia waited to finalise its 
planned Aer Lingus purchase, the deadline for which has been extended to 18 August to allow major shareholder 
Ryanair to sign off the deal.
Chief financial officer Enrique Dupuy says the company is "tackling every possible front in the battle of cost 
savings", although he acknowledged the pace of the reduction achieved in the second quarter - 7 per cent year on 
year at constant currencies - was unlikely to continue. The restructuring of Iberia is "still flowing through", he says, 
and a new salary agreement at low-cost carrier Vueling will work itself out of comparative numbers in the fourth 
quarter. The tailwind of lower fuel costs is also set to blow more strongly this year and in 2016, he adds.
Capacity rose by 5.3 per cent in the first six months thanks to growth in Vueling's fleet and restored Iberia routes. 
Passenger revenues increased by 11.5 per cent for the half, but that was largely driven by beneficial currency 
movements; IAG reports in euros, which have weakened. Air fares have been falling in constant-currency terms.
Analysts at Liberum expect adjusted pre-tax profits of 2.08bn (GBP1.46bn) this financial year, giving adjusted EPS 
of 75.6A, up from 1.11bn and 41.6A in 2014.

With the benefits of cost-cutting still to be fully realised, new routes planned and Aer Lingus to come on board, IAG 
is in a sweet spot. The shares are also trading on just 10 times Liberum's earnings forecast. Airline shares are 
notoriously volatile, but we're tempted to turn bullish. Buy.

Equities ending Budget week on a positive note.
Shares in leading house builders have moved up this morning after UK Chancellor George Osborne revealed plans 
to speed up house building by granting automatic planning permission to designated brownfield sites. The move 
could put some local authorities on the sidelines of the planning system. Further proposals would end the need for 
planning consent for upwards extensions to homes in London, up to the height of an adjoining building.

The Irish government has agreed to sell its stake in Aer Lingus as part of IAG's bid for the budget airline.
British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) has got its wish. The Irish government has given the 
legacy carrier's bid for Aer Lingus (AER) its blessing, in turn relinquishing its 25 per cent stake in the Irish budget 
airline.
The cabinet's decision comes after nearly six months of negotiations aimed at soothing concerns over the bid's 
knock-on effect on jobs and flights to and from Ireland. But to finally persuade ministers into backing the deal, IAG 
has given a seven-year guarantee on routes into London's Heathrow from Dublin, Cork and Shannon, but this 
promise is conditional on airport charges staying flat. Clearly, bosses at IAG had to meet the government half-way; 
IAG chief Willie Walsh previously said a five-year guarantee was all he could offer. On that note, Aer Lingus' Belfast 
routes are still only guaranteed for five years.
Aside from the government and Aer Lingus employees, the agreed deal is also good news for the Irish carrier's 
shareholders. IAG first approached Aer Lingus with a takeover offer at the end of last year, and followed up with an 
indicative offer in January an indicative offer in January that valued the airline at 1.36bn (GBP1bn). The financial 
terms accepted by the Irish government are as previously indicated: 2.50 per Aer Lingus share, plus the 0.05 per 
share dividend already declared but yet to be paid. The total consideration is still 1.4bn, to be funded by debt. That 
represents a premium of approximately 40 per cent to the closing price of 1.82 per Aer Lingus share on 17 
December 2014 - the last day of trading before the initial approach.
IAG has said the soon-to-be combined group could deliver up to 2.4 million more passengers by 2020, as well as 
adding four new destinations in North America and eight new aircraft to its fleet. The bid remains conditional on 
acceptance by fellow short-haul carrier Ryanair (RYA), which owns a 29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, and on EU 
approval.
Analysts at Liberum have said it is prudent to wait to update forecasts for IAG until the Aer Lingus bid formally 
completes. We'd expect the transaction to go through with the government's backing, and while we think Aer Lingus 
shareholders will be well-off, Ryanair shareholders could be due a cash windfall too.

One year on from a profit slump, it's a very different story for budget airline Ryanair
After a slew of profit upgrades and a bumper first half, a 66 per cent leap in annual profit at Ryanair (RYA) comes 
as no surprise. A number of factors have worked to the airline's advantage, including the slump in oil prices, which 
helped to drive down unit costs. Excluding fuel, costs stayed flat, but net margins still jumped from 10 per cent to 15 
per cent.
Ryanair has invested heavily in its 'Always Getting Better' customer experience programme. It appears to have paid 
off: customer numbers rose 11 per cent last year to 90.6m, as load factors - the capacity utilisation of public 
transport services - jumped from 83 per cent to 88 per cent. To keep up with rising passenger numbers, Ryanair 
has placed orders for another 183 B737-800 aircraft (which should all be delivered by 2018) and 200 B737 Max 
200s from 2019 onwards.
Forward bookings are running 4 per cent ahead of last year. But Ryanair bosses have warned there could be an 
"irrational pricing response" from competitors this year, as other budget airlines attempt to undercut low fares.
Analysts are reviewing forecasts in light of management's guidance for net income between 940m and 970m for the 
March 2016 year-end. This compares with a consensus estimate of 974m.

The US dollar has rallied, while Japan signals that it will pursue further stimulus initiatives. Meanwhile, shares in 
Hong Kong were buoyed overnight on news that China will soon launch a link allowing Hong Kong and mainland 
asset managers to sell funds to retail investors on either side.
Oil prices are in limbo ahead of next week's meeting of OPEC oil ministers in Vienna. Most analysts believe that the 
cartel will hold to the existing production quota at 30m barrels a day, although there will be increased pressure from 
high-cost OPEC producers, who will be pushing for higher oil prices.
IC TIP UPDATES:
International waste management business, Shanks Group (SKS) has launched its first Green Bond Issue to retail 
investors in Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to raise up to 150m. The Bonds are guaranteed by 29 
subsidiary guarantor.
Industrial chain manufacturer Renold (RNO) has reported underlying adjusted operating profits rose by almost a 
half in 2014/15, which is ahead of market expectations.
KEY STORIES:
Range Resources (RRL) revealed that it has signed a conditional new funding deal worth up to $35m. A 
memorandum of understanding with newly-established investment fund Beijing Sibo Investment Management sets 
out the terms of a conditional share subscription, although that it will not be completed until the latter part of this 
year.
Budget carrier Ryanair (RYA) has reported a 66 per cent hike in net profits in the last year. Profits rose to 867m 
(GBP613.6m) in the 12 months to March. The number of customers also rose by 11 per cent over the period from

Still no word on the Aer Lingus bid, but trading has picked up strongly
What's new:
a No word on Aer Lingus bid
a First-quarter operating profit
a Lower fuel and unit costs
There's no word as yet, but International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) boss Willie Walsh says the fate of Irish carrier 
Aer Lingus will be settled in the next couple of weeks. The British Airways owner made a 1.4bn (GBP1.03bn) bid for 
Aer Lingus at the start of the year, and has been in negotiations with the Irish government which owns more than a 
quarter of the airline. The bid is conditional on acceptance by the government and Aer Lingus's largest shareholder, 
Ryanair (RYA), which holds a 29.9 per cent stake.
In the meantime, thanks to lower unit and fuel costs, IAG managed to post an inaugural first-quarter operating profit 
of 25m, compared with losses of 150m this time last year. Non-fuel unit costs were down 2.7 per cent in the first 
three months of the year, and fuel costs fell 11 per cent.
IAG still expects to generate an operating profit in excess of 2.2bn this year. That said, the rate of profit 
improvement in the second quarter will be slower than the first, due to the timing of Easter, and adverse year-on-
year movements in fuel prices thanks to a strengthening dollar.
As the oil price climbed to a five-year high this week, shares in IAG dipped 2 per cent. But analysts said there may 
well have been some simultaneous profit-taking following a 35 per cent rise in the share price over the past 12 
months.
A
Liberum says...
First-quarter profit for IAG
Buy. A rare first-quarter operating profit was encouraging and a touch better than our forecast and consensus. 
Posting even a small operating profit in the seasonally weakest quarter is both encouraging and atypical, even if 
there may have been a little support from the timing of Easter. Trading on a 2015 PE ratio of 10, we continue to see 
IAG as undervalued. Its valuation is closer to those of its network carrier peers, despite a superior financial 
performance which resembles the higher-rated low cost carriers. We expect pre-tax profit of 2.1bn this year, giving 
EPS of 75.6E.
A
Cantor Fitzgerald says...
Sell. We recently downgraded our view on IAG. The group has strongly outperformed the sector and its close 
peers, and its valuation is now unattractive, trading on a 15 per cent net debt to cash profit premium to the sector. 
We are somewhat concerned about the group's reliance on profits at British Airways and, hence, North American 
traffic. These are solid first-quarter results but we think any good news is priced in, especially as management has 
been silent on progress with its 2.55 per share offer for Aer Lingus. Trading is also expected to slow in the second 
quarter.
City analysts are split on IAG. Depending on which ratio is used, the shares (at 557p) can look expensive or cheap. 
In our view, the stock has been buoyed by external factors such as the oil price. So until the Aer Lingus bid is 
settled, we're inclined to stay neutral.

Oil price fall boosts easyJet

Budget airline easyJet (EZJ) has upped its half-year guidance amid falling oil prices and a weak euro.
A weak euro and plunge in the oil price have left easyJet (EZJ) flying high in 2015. While airlines typically make a 
loss over the winter period, easyJet has tweaked its half-year guidance to allow for a potential half-year pre-tax 
profit. Having previously expected an interim loss of between GBP10m and GBP30m, chief executive Carolyn 
McCall said the group could now land somewhere between a loss of GBP5m and pre-tax profit of GBP10m. Last 
year, easyJet made a GBP53m loss.
The group's fuel bill should be GBP35m lower in the six months to the end of March 2015, compared with the same 
period last year. This shows how airlines are starting to benefit from the 50 per cent plunge in oil prices since last 
summer. Currency movements are also set to generate a GBP20m windfall by the time first-half results roll around 
in May. Analysts have pointed out that should the company report a pre-tax profit at the results, it would be the first 
time it has done so since 2002.
Meanwhile, full-year results from newly listed Wizz Air (WIZZ) are also due in May. After a strong fourth quarter, the 
board said expectations are "in line" despite an ongoing restructuring in Ukraine. The Hungary-based airline initially 
cancelled its IPO last summer, but as economic conditions for airlines have improved it finally came to market at the 
start of March at a price of 1,150p apiece. Since then, the share price has accelerated to 1,350p.
Wizz competes against a clutch of small budget carriers in Europe, including Vueling (ES:VLG) and Norwegian Air 
Shuttle (NO:NAS). It concentrates on connecting different parts of Europe, a market that is largely dominated by the 
duopoly of easyJet and Irish carrier Ryanair (RYA). It operates a fleet of 55 Airbus A320 aircraft and offers more 
than 360 routes from 20 bases across 37 countries. Last year, it claims to have carried more than 15m passengers 
between 100 destinations. Most recently the group added a new aircraft to its Bulgarian operation and started 
operating from its ninth airport in Romania.
EasyJet has yet to translate group savings into customer savings through lower fares, but it has certainly done well 
by its investors. We advised buying shares in easyJet again last July (1,371p, 3 Jul 2014) and, since then, the 
share price has risen 36 per cent. At the time of the full-year results last November, the group upped the group 
dividend by more than a third, too. Buy.

Having revised its bid for the Irish national carrier, IAG is in hot pursuit of Aer Lingus.
The board at Irish budget airline Aer Lingus (EIL) is considering a revised 2.55 a share offer from International 
Consolidated Airlines (IAG), the owner of British Airways. The new offer - which values Aer Lingus at roughly 
1.36bn - improves on two previous bids. But the deal is still dependent on the recommendation of Aer Lingus's 
board and both Ryanair (RYA) and the Irish government. Ryanair holds a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, while 
the Irish government owns just over 25 per cent of the company.
Aer Lingus is the fourth-largest operator at Heathrow after British Airways, German airline Lufthansa and Richard 
Branson's Virgin Atlantic. Analysts suspect that IAG's interest in Aer Lingus is focused on the airline's 23 pairs of 
take-off and landing slots at the airport. IAG was quick to reassure shareholders on both sides that, if acquired, Aer 
Lingus will still operate as a separate entity under its own branding. But a trade union representing Aer Lingus staff 
said a takeover could put 1,200 jobs in jeopardy - a quarter of the workforce.
Aer Lingus previously rejected offers worth 2.30 and 2.40 a share. But the latest bid represents a 47 per cent 
premium to the Aer Lingus share price on 16 December, which marked the initial approach by IAG.
There are political hurdles to overcome, but all stakeholders look set to benefit. Ryanair shareholders could receive 
a cash windfall, Aer Lingus could operate independently within the safety net of IAG, and more landing slots at 
Heathrow will boost growth for IAG.

Last week's Autumn Statement brought London's listed airline companies some good news.
Chancellor George Osborne gave the airline industry some good news last week when he announced plans to 
scrap air passenger duty (APD) for children under 12 from 1 May next year. The change came in Mr Osborne's 
Autumn Statement, and industry experts believe it paves the way for the complete abolition of air passenger duty 
for all customers in the future.
London-listed airlines welcomed the development with open arms. EasyJet (EZJ) shares rose 3 per cent following 
the news and Carolyn McCall - - EasyJet's chief executive and an anti-APD champion - - said she hoped to see 
total abolition of the tax. Her sentiments were echoed by International Consolidated Airlines' (IAG) boss Willie 
Walsh and Michael O'Leary of Ryanair (RYA). All three executives have long urged for the government to scrap air 
passenger duty to promote growth in the UK via cheap travel fares. But the government plans only to scrap the fee 
for children, equating to a saving of roughly GBP13.
It's not the first change made to air passenger duty this year. In March, when Mr Osborne revealed details of this 
year's Budget, he said he planned to simplify the tax system for long-haul flights - - particularly those long-haul 
flights to "fast-growth" destinations including China, Brazil and Australia.
But some companies in the airline sector are riding high for reasons other than the changes made to APD. EasyJet 
recently reported a solid set of results reported a solid set of results. Revenue per seat rose 1.2 per cent last year - 
and nearly 2 per cent at constant currencies - to GBP63.31, even though the total number of European short-haul 
seats flown rose by 4.3 per cent. That meant easyJet posted its fourth consecutive year of record pre-tax profits, up 
by more than fifth to GBP581m. Chief executive Carolyn McCall said the company's resilience can be attributed to 
"discipline", both on spending and capacity plans. But easyJet, like some of its competitors, has also benefitted 
from the recent drop-off in the oil price. As a budget carrier which consumes an enormous amount of fuel, a 
significant portion of easyJet's operating costs are tied to aviation fuel. Competitive advantages, such as lower staff 
costs, are progressively negated for easyJet as fuel prices increase. But this pattern reverses as prices contract.
Ryanair shares have leapt in value, too. This was primarily on the back of a profit upgrade. But the influence of the 
Autumn Statement is clear as well. On 2 December Ryanair shares were changing hands for 893E each. By the 5 
December - following Mr Osborne's speech - that had risen to 967E.
airlines take off
Last week's profit upgrade is the second time Ryanair has re-evaluated forecasts in the space of a month. Now, 
Ryanair expects post-tax profits to fall between 810m and 830m, up from the previously upgraded estimate of 
750m-770m. But rumours are swirling among City analysts that Ryanair is still erring on the side of caution with its 
latest forecasts in the hope of eventually beating them. In the first six months of the financial year, the budget airline 
reported a 9 per cent rise in revenues to 3.54bn, and pre-tax profits of 908m.
The Irish carrier said a 22 per cent rise in passenger numbers to 6.35m in November had motivated the change of 
heart, with earlier customer bookings and targeted sales drives encouraging last month's growth. Over the past 
year, Ryanair passenger numbers have risen 5 per cent to 85.4m and it expects more than 90m customers to have 
flown Ryanair by the year-end.
The recent results pay homage to Ryanair's 2013 strategy to improve its customer service and scrap a number of 
what it believed to be "unpopular" customer policies. It's allowed more carry-on baggage, allocated seating and cut 
certain charges. It's no wonder, then, that the market reacted well to news that Ryanair will lower its air fares to 
reflect the changes to APD.
Of the London-listed budget carriers, easyJet is our preferred pick. The shares trade on just 12 times forward 
earnings which, for a business with easyJet's growth track record and resilience, is good value. Ryanair's recent 
trajectory is encouraging, but the shares are more expensive. Given the sector's volatility, Ryanair will need more 
than a bumper month to sell investors a long-term growth story.

Unexpectedly buoyant results from Ryanair (RYA) have prompted a massive earnings upgrade for the full year
Shares in Ryanair (RYA) took off after the low-cost carrier reported that net profit in the first half rose by a third to 
795m (GBP620m). The favourable timing of Easter flattered the figures, but the company also attributed bumper 
trading to the success of its plan to improve its notorious customer experience and offer a wider range of options, 
such as Family Extra and Business Plus tickets and allocated seating.
Traffic rose 4 per cent, despite a 5 per cent increase in average fares, pushing capacity up 4 percentage points to 
89 per cent. Unit costs also dipped 2 per cent, thanks to a slump in oil prices; excluding fuel they rose 3 per cent. 
Costs are set to fall further following the order of 200 ultra fuel-efficient Boeing 737-MAX aircrafts, which offer eight 
extra seats and more leg room, although delivery will only start in 2019. The company's geographical expansion 
continued, too, with four new bases and 57 routes.
Forward bookings for the winter season are running 5 per cent ahead of last year, which prompted management to 
raise full-year net profit guidance from 650-750m to 770m. However, chief executive Michael O'Leary warned that 
"extreme caution" should underpin any medium-term forecasts, given the limited visibility for the fourth quarter.
Broker Investec Securities has placed its net profit forecasts under review, but says consensus for net income is 
likely to move up by 11 per cent to 760m, giving EPS of 55A.

When taking our pick of the notoriously volatile airline sector, it's budget behemoth easyJet (EZJ) which grabs our 
attention.
A slew of profit warnings flooded the airline sector last month, prompting many companies' share prices to plummet. 
While swimming against the tide is not for the faint of heart, we feel the recent share price ructions have created a 
buying opportunity in the shares of high-quality carrier easyJet (EZJ), which incidentally has not been among those 
companies to warn.
While the shares do not stand out as particularly cheap compared with those of peers, the stock's attraction is to be 
found in easyJet's robust business model and growth potential. This is reflected in the fact that the budget airline 
has not retracted its growth projections like many of its competitors did last month. This, coupled with the fact that 
easyJet shares are trading at a 12 per cent discount to their two-year average PE ratio and inside the lowest 
quartile of ratings recorded over that period, suggests the current share price offers an attractive entry point for new 
investors.
The airline sector is in a state of flux. Rival group Ryanair (RYA) has issued two profit warnings in the last year, 
while Irish competitor Aer Lingus (AERL) is suffering at the hands of poor industrial relations with staff. The latest 
casualty is travel firm Dart (DTG), owner of budget airline Jet2, which last month warned 2015 operating profits 
would not meet expectations: Dart's share price plummeted 26 per cent.
Meanwhile, several carriers are pushing back or cancelling future aircraft orders in a bid to pinch pennies. For 
example, Airbus (AIR) suffered a major setback earlier in June after Emirates Airlines, the fast-growing Gulf carrier, 
cancelled a $16bn order for 70 new A350 passenger jets.
But easyJet has arguably emerged the leader of budget airlines, despite being only the fifth largest carrier in Europe 
by passenger numbers. It made significant changes to its product offering in the last year or so, such as allocated 
seating and better focus on business travellers - strategies its competitors are now trying their best to replicate. But 
unlike its rivals, easyJet has not fallen foul of pricing pressure or insurmountable costs. It also seems unfazed by 
the recent hike in the oil price following the latest violence in Iraq and Ukraine.
Additional slots at London Gatwick airport were picked up from rival group Flybe (FLYB) last year, and will help 
easyJet capitalise on its aggressive capacity plans. A 7 per cent increase in European short-haul routes is pencilled 
Fly high with easyJet
in for the coming year. Interestingly, the airline is less concerned about the so-called weak demand in Europe, 
which its competitors are quick to blame for this year's profit squeeze.
Analysts think easyJet's strong cash flow will prompt payment of another special dividend early next year, which is 
reflected in the forecasts used in the accompanying table. The group already returned GBP308m to shareholders 
following a strong financial performance in 2013. This amounted to 77.6p a share when coupled with the ordinary 
dividend.
Admittedly, easyJet's days as the market dominator are not guaranteed. There's been a pick-up in competition from 
carriers such as Vueling and Norwegian Air Shuttle, and despite Ryanair's poor outlook, its shares are still a 
favourite among City analysts. But it is easyJet's controlled growth programme, and resilient performance in the 
past which prompt us to be bullish on the shares. It still holds a competitive cost advantage over legacy carriers and 
has maintained a lean cost base in recent years.

Fly high with easyJet
The shares have tumbled since March, but this is down to a lack of positive sentiment for the sector. It's our belief 
that momentum will return, especially if easyJet is able to hand back generous returns to shareholders in the 
coming year. At the moment, weakness in the share price, and a forward PE ratio of 14 dropping to 10 in 2015 
should be considered a buying opportunity. Sometimes, it's best to trust in quality.

Here is a selection of today's business press headlines.
Steer clear of McBride (MCB). The private label household products outfit yesterday announced the exit from 
unprofitable product lines in the contract space, where it makes products for the likes of Procter&Gamble and 
Unilever (ULVR). That will send contract revenues plummeting by 20 per cent in the year to the end of June. On a 
more positive note, its own-label products saw flat revenues in the first three months of the year, as encouraging 
growth in the likes of France, Germany and Poland offset weakness in the UK.
However, the fact remains that it has been taking a hit from the supermarket price wars. Hence, the contribution to 
revenues from that side of the business now stands at 11 per cent versus 18 per cent several years back and there 
are no signs of lessening margin pressures. At 5 per cent the yield on the stock is attractive but not enough so 
given that little improvement can be expected in the core UK market, writes The Times' Tempus.
Any high-performance undertaking requires the most precise instrumentation. Unfortunately, as financial markets 
careen higher central bankers have been systematically smashing all the dials. Hence the record low yields in high 
risk debt or depressed levels of volatility. The latter, when measured by the VIX, is at February 2007 lows, as 
central bankers flood the financial system with liquidity. In parallel, the Dow Jones Industrials continues to set fresh 
highs almost on a daily basis and the Footsie is nearing its all-time record.
Yet that is not due to growth in profits. Earnings forecasts in the UK and Europe for over the next twelve months 
have come down by 12.5 per cent, according to broker Charles Stanley. Companies meanwhile continue to splurge 
on share buybacks, increasingly financed by debt. Even when taking into account rising cash levels corporate net 
debt is above 2008 levels, research from Societe General shows. No, don't panic, but you may want to think about 
how to best safeguard your capital in the year ahead, says The Daily Telegraph's Questor column.
BUSINESS PRESS HEADLINES:
President Petro Poroshenko declared an end to a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine late Monday and the beginning of a 
new attack to "liberate our land" from pro-Russia rebels, ignoring pressure from Moscow to extend the 10-day-old 
truce and dealing a blow to hopes for talks. The decision to use the army represents a gamble by Mr. Poroshenko 
that Russia won't send in its troops, massed for months on the other side of the border, and that Kiev's ragtag

forces can oust the increasingly well-armed militants who have seized swaths of Ukraine's Russian-speaking east. - 
- The Wall Street Journal Europe
Marks & Spencer (MKS) has handed control of its high street stores to the director in charge of the company's 
online business in a landmark move that highlights the evolution in the retail industry. Laura Wade-Gery, who has 
overseen a GBP100m revamp of the M&S website, will assume responsibility for the company's 800 UK stores as 
part of a revamp of the board. She is the first woman to be at the helm of M&S's retail business. - - The Daily 
Telegraph
Britain and other countries risk being caught in a 'debt trap' if ultra-low interest rates carry on for too much longer, 
the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements has warned. It said nations that have tried to boost their 
economies by cutting base rates to rock bottom could find themselves in a downward spiral, as cheap interest costs 
encourage even more borrowing. The influential global banking watchdog does not single out individual countries 
for censure but its words clearly apply to Britain, which has seen the base rate pegged at 0.5 per cent since March 
2009. - - The Daily Mail
The government must carry out an independent assessment of the ability of consumers to pay an extra GBP250bn 
in household bills over the next 15 years to modernise Britain's ageing infrastructure, MPs have said. Warning that 
the poorest households would be hit hard by years of above-inflation increases, members of the influential public 
accounts committee (PAC) said consumers would be expected to meet two-thirds of the GBP375bn total cost of 
major upgrades to services including energy, water, communications and transport. - - The Guardian
Poundworld has secured GBP26m in new funding to open more stores in Britain and grow its overseas supply 
chain. The discount retailer, the third-largest single price point retailer in the UK, yesterday said it intends to expand 
its total UK stores - - currently standing at more than 240 - - by 40 to 50 each year for the next three years. It also 
aims to open more distribution depots, and already 30 per cent of its suppliers are based overseas. The new 
funding arrangement includes a GBP17.6m import loan facility on extended terms. - The Scotsman
Two of Michael O'Leary's most loyal lieutenants will be sitting on Ryanair's (RYA) board as non-executives within 
the year. Howard Millar, Finance Director of the budget airline for the past 20 years a and joint deputy Chief 
Executive for the past ten a is stepping down at the end of the year. News of his departure follows just three months 
after that of Michael Cawley who left after a decade of being deputy Chief Executive with Mr Millar. - - The Times

Airline stocks lose altitude, but for how long?

The airline industry has taken a beating in recent weeks, but does this mean investors should write the sector off?
The latest violence in Iraq is not helping the airline industry. Renewed volatility in oil prices has dampened 
prospects for carriers, many of whom have already warned on profits in recent months. Fuel accounts for a high 
proportion of their costs, and increases here will hurt despite aggressive hedging policies. Attacks by Isis militants in 
Iraq shot Brent crude to a nine-month high of $115 (GBP68) a barrel last week, ending a period of fairly stable 
prices. Strike action and cancelled jet orders - never good news for the sector - have upset share prices, too, and 
growth prospects remain a topic of lively debate.
While some carriers dismiss any long-term effect from rising oil prices, clearly the timing isn't good. Hungarian 
budget airline Wizz Air has just scrapped plans for an IPO in London worth 200m (GBP160m), citing poor industry 
sentiment and volatility in airline shares. Of course, appetite for stock market listings here has deteriorated rapidly 
across most sectors, but investors are obviously worried about growth within the airline industry.
3643726506001
1270513410001
Wizz Air's nerves might also indicate something more sinister; that the days of budget airlines Ryanair (RYA) and 
easyJet's (EZJ) domination of the skies could be numbered. Budapest-based Wizz Air only began flying paying 
passengers in 2004, and is one of several new low-cost carriers - among them Norwegian Air Shuttle and Vueling - 
that provides increased competition for longer established European rivals. The timing for these new entrants 
couldn't be better. Shares in Lufthansa (GER: LHA) fell 14 per cent earlier this month when the company cut 
operating profit forecasts for both 2014 and 2015 by 25 per cent to 1bn and 2bn, respectively. Excess capacity in 
European and US routes were blamed. But industrial action and weak pricing are bugging Lufthansa, too - both 
problems it cannot solve quickly simply by slashing more costs.
Cost-cutting has been a dominant theme for the airlines in recent years, although the pay-off has been better for 
some than others. Recovery play Flybe (FLYB) announced its first annual profit since listing three years ago. New 
chief executive Saad Hammad claimed his recovery plan, largely based around trimming away excess costs, 
delivered the right results and only a focus on "the four Ds: discipline, discipline, discipline, discipline" would keep 
Flybe in the black. While the company's enterprise value stands at eight times cash profits, making recovery 
Airline stocks lose altitude, but for how long?
prospects appear priced in, investors should not ignore the fact the shares soared 174 per cent over the past year, 
delivering significant growth in Flybe's market value.
But Flybe's story has been the exception rather than the rule. Recent research estimates that between 1993 and 
2012, return on invested capital (ROIC) in the airline industry never exceeded the cost of capital, leaving them with 
little to no economic profit. And share prices certainly appear shaky. Lufthansa rallied above 20 earlier this year 
from a rock-bottom 7.50 in mid-2012. Now they're back below 16. And bad news here is infectious. Both 
International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) - owner of flag carrier British Airways - and easyJet enthusiastically 
followed the German's lead lower.
And Lufthansa is not alone. Irish carrier Aer Lingus (AERL), which last September warned that aggressive rival 
Ryanair was pinching business, now admits that cabin crew strikes have hit customer bookings further. Operating 
profits for the 2014 financial year could be as much as 20 per cent lower than the 61m achieved last year, following 
staff strikes in May and the threat of further action this month. Any recovery, Aer Lingus says, will be down to how 
quickly it manages to regain customer confidence, and, like Lufthansa, it is also in the midst of heavy cost-cutting 
and big job losses.
Reining in profit expectations is not the only sign of trouble afoot. Multiple cancellations of orders are also an 
indication of squeezed finances. Airbus suffered a major setback earlier in June after Emirates Airline, the fast-
growing Gulf carrier, cancelled a $16bn order for 70 new A350 passenger jets. Dubai-based Emirates was to be a 
high-profile launch customer for the long-range A350, which is due to enter service at the end of 2014 to compete 
with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 777 aircraft. While Airbus's chief executive Fabrice Bregier claimed there'd be no 
negative impact from the cancellation, news that it would cut the A350 order book by 9 per cent has hurt the jet 
manufacturer's share price. Rolls-Royce (RR.), the sole engine supplier for the A350, fell, too.
The final cause for concern for airline investors is the stall in easyJet shares. The share price has enjoyed a 
meteoric rise over the last three years but has started to dip as industry sentiment suffers. Analysts at Davy are not 
concerned: they believe summer trading will be strong despite foreign currency headwinds and a capital markets 
day in September will help reignite the performance of the share price. We'll see.
A
IC VIEW:
There can be little doubt the airlines sector is in a state of flux. New entrants are skittish to make their presence felt 
in a volatile market while analysts are promoting mixed views on the impact of rising oil prices. As a result, some 
airline shares are trading at tempting discounts to their long-term averages, and so offer investors a cheaper entry 
point into the market. Others, however, are still trading at a premium and offer unclear growth prospects despite 
evident momentum in the share price. Overall, the weakness in the industry is ripe for stock picking but investors 
should still tread carefully.
A
FAVOURITES:
While we stop short of upgrading our neutral stance on the airline sector's dominant players, opportunities for 
investors keen to diversify their portfolios with an airline holding appear to be emerging. Recovery play Flybe 
(FLYB) offers the most attractive growth profile having declared maiden profits this year, although the shares have 
weakened recently and may have further to fall before support kicks in. EasyJet (EZJ) is tipped to grow at a decent 
pace, too. Trading these days at a more palatable 12 times EPS forecasts for 2015, a 10 per cent discount to its 
historic average, the shares look interesting again. Lastly, the likelihood of a special dividend from Ryanair (RYA) is 
far from certain, but the prospect of a generous yield should help reignite investor interest in the shares.
A
Airline stocks lose altitude, but for how long?
OUTSIDERS:
It's easy to be negative on the sector, and, clearly, some of the sharp falls in the share price of several airlines 
could be taken as a buying opportunity. Unfortunately, Aer Lingus (AERL) is not one of them. Trading at a five-year 
high prior to the latest profits warning, it must rank as the carrier with least potential. Strike action is notoriously 
difficult to price in as has been the case with companies such as Royal Mail (RMG), and recapturing customer 
confidence will be no mean feat. Good cost cutting efforts and a long-haul flight proposition will be fairly 
meaningless if tense industrial relations continue to blight progress.
A
THE BROKER'S VIEW:
"Ryanair is trading well and the outlook for the current financial year is positive," says Rob Byde, analyst at Cantor 
Fitzgerald. Summer bookings "are approximately 5 per cent ahead of last year" and 500m of excess cash will "very 
likely" be returned through a special dividend in early 2015. "The special dividend would have a yield of 5.1 per 
cent," he adds. Mr Byde also believes as Ryanair continues to improve its customer experience and introduces 
more services at airports, it will gain market share and margins will expand. He points out that the stock "is not 
expensive," pointing out that a forward PE ratio of 15 is a 6 per cent discount to its long-run average.
In fact, Mr Byde prefers Ryanair to easyJet as "near-term catalysts for the latter company are lacking." But he 
admits easyJet's fundamentals "remain strong and management is busy fine-tuning the network, trimming costs and 
making the service more attractive to business travellers." He estimates easyJet has "sufficient headroom to pay 
another special dividend in early 2015." But Mr Byde warns more short-haul capacity in Europe could "dampen 
fares."
Despite a profit warning, Mr Byde believes Lufthansa's fundamentals "are also sound." He cut forecasts in line with 
Lufthansa's new guidance, but claims excess capacity "is a problem for all carriers who will now have to trim their 
plans." He thinks renewed guidance from Lufthansa could prove to be overly conservative, too, particularly as 
demand continues to recover. "Cost-cutting should now accelerate," he says - management estimates a 4 per cent 
cut in unit costs this year. In the meantime, Lufthansa trades on a forward PE ratio of 7.7, representing a 15 per 
cent discount to its long-run average.

RESULTS: Budget airline Ryanair (RYA) has reported the first drop in annual profits for five years.
A 3 per cent increase in passenger numbers didn't stop Ryanair (RYA) reporting its first drop in annual profits for 
five years for the period to 31 March. An industry-wide price war, currency headwinds and higher fuel prices hit the 
budget airline's bottom line, yet chief executive Michael O'Leary is adamant that ongoing improvements to customer 
service will help profits recover.
Relaxed bag restrictions, allocated seating and easier booking conditions seem to have upped the appeal of the 
low-cost carrier. But prices nonetheless slipped 4 per cent over the year. Management expects passenger numbers 
to grow marginally faster this financial year, but warns that capacity growth next winter - it expects to ground only 50 
aircraft, down from 70 - could again weigh on ticket prices.
Mr O'Leary nonetheless believes post-tax profits will recover to between 580m and 620m, although he warned 
there was "zero visibility" over winter trading. Ryanair will still hand back more than 500m to shareholders in the 
form of a special dividend, bringing the total returned to shareholders since 2008 to 2.5bn. The carrier is also on 
track to deliver on a promise made last June to return 1bn to shareholders within two years.
Brokerage Panmure Gordon expects pre-tax profits of 773m for the coming year, giving EPS of 47.8E.

In the third 10-company segment of our analysis of Aim's top 100 companies, we give our verdict on Redcentric, 
M&C Saatchi, Tissue Regenix, Lekoil, Helphire, Velocys, Sirius Minerals, Gemfields, Impellam and Telford Homes
80. REDCENTRIC
Redcentric (RCN), spun off from IT specialist Redstone Group and listed on Aim just under a year ago, provides 
managed IT services to UK companies. Its past projects range from improving the stability of Ryanair's web booking 
system to rolling out wireless networks across Renault's UK dealerships.
It's already made some bold moves, purchasing rival inTechnology for GBP65m in cash last December. The deal 
makes it one of the market's largest players, broadens its product range and client base, and could drive savings. 
For example, Redcentric plans to close three less efficient data centres and two offices.
Its finances don't look shabby, either. In its maiden set of results for the six months ended 30 September, it earned 
adjusted cash profits of GBP3.6m on sales of just over GBP10m, and won or extended service contracts worth 
GBP12m over the next three years. But there were some issues. Net debt of about GBP12m is almost half of its 
equity, and administrative expenses amounted to a third of its revenues.
Redcentric's shares soared to a high of 122p in March, and currently trade at 15 times analysts' forecast earnings. 
That looks pricy at this early stage, so we reiterate our hold recommendation. Hold. TM
79. M&C SAATCHI
Multinational media agency M&C Saatchi (SAA) was created by brothers Maurice and Charles Saatchi after they 
were ousted in 1995 from the company they founded, Saatchi & Saatchi. It listed on Aim in 2004, and after an up-
and-down decade, looks to be on the right track.
Its sales rose 5 per cent last year, as it signed up high-profile clients including O2 and Land Rover and delivered a 
strong UK performance. That home-turf display was driven by Saatchi's customer relationship management (CRM) 
business, which analyses user data to allow personalised marketing, along with new mobile tools. Both are 
expected to roll-out worldwide this year.
Redcentric to Telford Homes
The business also sold its majority stake in Walker Media for GBP36m in November, as it lacked the scale to 
compete effectively in the media-buying business. Shareholders received a cut, in the shape of a GBP21m share 
buy-back. But there were some soft spots - - profits declined 18 per cent in Europe, and sales in Asia and Australia 
also slipped.
Saatchi offers an attractive, global growth profile. But its shares have doubled in the past two years, and trade at 19 
times broker Numis's forward earnings, a 35 per cent premium to the sector. That lofty rating, coupled with ongoing 
challenges, could keep its shares at bay for now. Hold. TM
78. TISSUE REGENIX
After nearly three and a half years as a public company, analysts are beginning to agree that York-based medtech 
group Tissue Regenix (TRX) is becoming an investable company. The US launch of DermaPure is still on track for 
the first half of 2014 and momentum in the share price has started to build as any potential risks start to be 
eliminated.
DermaPure works by taking human donor skin, removing the DNA and cells and using the company's patented 
dCELL technology to leave a natural 'scaffold' that can be placed in patients' wounds to aid natural healing by 
attracting the patient's own cells to the wound area. America is a crucial market for the company: chronic wounds 
affect around 6.5m patients in the US. Accordingly, TRX has signed seven independent sales distribution 
agreements in the US, which will mobilise 40 sales representatives to promote DermaPure into acute care 
hospitals, veteran hospitals and institutions as well as long-term acute care hospitals.
Tissue Regenix has flown under the radar for so long, the current share price doesn't present new investors with 
the cheapest buying opportunity. That said, analysts expect the shares to double in value once sales of DermaPure 
are generated. Buy. HR
77. LEKOIL
Aim newcomer Lekoil (LEK) experienced the perfect start to life as a listed company when its first ever exploration 
well discovered more than three-quarters of a billion barrels of oil-equivalent resources off the coast of Nigeria last 
summer. UBS analyst Daniel Ekstein described it as potentially "one of the biggest shallow water discoveries in 
West Africa of the past decade".
That should have sent the company's shares rocketing - - instead, they 'merely' doubled - - but equity markets are 
refusing to ascribe anything close to full value for Lekoil's 30 per cent economic interest in the licence until joint-
venture partner Afren (AFR) can prove the oil and gas can be commercially extracted.
Geological understanding of the field is still limited and an all-important flow test could not be completed last year 
"due to hydrocarbon kicks". An appraisal drilling programme scheduled for the second half of 2014 could 
nevertheless change all that. The partners have also started shooting 3D seismic over the rest of the licence, which 
should refine and de-risk other prospects in the block that were previously identified by 2D seismic.
UBS's Mr Ekstein conservatively estimates, assuming no value for the field's gas, that oil and condensates alone 
justify a risked net present value of $2.9bn (GBP1.7) for the entire field. Lekoil's current market capitalisation is just 
GBP185m, but we expect the market to reassess this following appraisal activity. Buy. MA
76. HELPHIRE
Helphire (HHR), which provides hire vehicles for drivers involved in accidents that aren't their fault, has something 
of a chequered past. By claiming from the insurance companies of drivers that are at fault, Helphire grew fast during 
the 1990s but, not long into the new century, its insurance company clients began to baulk at the prices they were 
being charged. They responded with delayed payments and litigation and, in no time, Helphire found itself mired in 
trouble. The two sides eventually agreed a fixed price-setting regime and, for a time, growth once again resumed.
Redcentric to Telford Homes
But growth soon evaporated once the recession hit and, after 2009, management responded with a big and 
successful restructuring exercise. A further move back to health came last year after Helphire eliminated its hefty 
debt burden through a debt-for-equity swap and a GBP60m placing. At the end of December's half-year stage, the 
company's pre-tax profit had recovered to GBP4.8m - - in 2011, in sharp contrast, it suffered a GBP34.1m loss.
Challenges remain, however. Last year's ban on the receipt and payment of referral fees in relation to personal 
injury cases, for example, meant an GBP11.4m fall in turnover at 2013's first-half stage. And the Competition 
Commission's probe into the motor insurance market also raises uncertainties. Broker Cenkos is forecasting flat 
earnings until at least the end of June 2016 (of 0.3p) and the shares already trade on a demanding 23 times 
forecast earnings. The 4.4 per cent prospective yield looks good for existing shareholders, but there's little to attract 
new investors just yet. Hold. JA
75. VELOCYS
A heavily-oversubscribed share placing at 125p late in 2012 marked a sea-change in attitudes to Velocys (VLS) - - 
formerly known as Oxford Catalysts. New and serious commercial backers emerged including Chelsea Football 
Club owner Roman Abramovich's Ervington Investments (it still owns 4m shares). Yet, despite further newsflow, the 
share price has traded sideways between 125p and 175p for over a year. However, a joint venture just signed in the 
US could, according to broker Charles Stanley, be "the breakthrough for Velocys that the market has been waiting 
for".
Chief executive Roy Lipski certainly thinks so. America's largest waste company, landfill operator Waste 
Management, and Houston-based electricity giant NRG, do, too. They want to use Velocys' gas-to-liquids (GTL) 
technology to generate renewable biogas, which when combined with cheap natural gas can be turned in valuable 
liquid fuel. "This is first time that big companies have come out and said we're doing small-scale GTL," Mr Lipski 
told us. "It's a milestone."
Of course, we have heard this before, and timing is always uncrtain. Nonetheless, if Charles Stanley's figures are 
right, Velocys, which lost GBP18m last year, could generate underlying pre-tax profit of GBP3.4m in 2015. That 
would be progress, and makes Velocys's shares a speculative buy. LW
74. SIRIUS MINERALS
Last year didn't exactly go according to plan for Sirius Minerals (SXX). First, the company had to withdraw its 
mining permit application for the York potash project - - located on the outskirts of a national park in Yorkshire - - 
after third-party consultants for the park authority said more environmental studies were required. Then global 
potash prices tanked after the surprise break-up of the world's largest producer cartel.
Sirius plans to resubmit its application in July but the year-long delay resulted in a cash crunch. A GBP43m placing 
completed in March will hopefully be enough for Sirius to see out the UK's lengthy permitting process; following the 
mining permit, the company will still need to obtain a "materials handling plant and storage" permit as well as a 
Teeside port permit. At the earliest, this will take until April 2016.
After that, Sirius would have to raise $2.2bn (GBP1.3bn) for phase one construction. That's a lot to ask for any 
junior miner but it could prove even more difficult since the specific type of potash mineralisation found at Sirius's 
York project is new to the market. The risks here are numerous to say the least, and we continue to recommend 
avoiding the shares. Sell. MA
73. GEMFIELDS
Gemfields (GEM) is an Aim constituent with a business model adapted to appeal to consumers of luxury goods with 
a conscience. The company markets ethically-sourced emeralds from the Kagem mining complex in Zambia, but it 
is moving into the commercial phase at the Montepuez ruby deposit in Mozambique. Eventually, Gemfields intends 
to add sapphires to its product offering. And Gemfields' ability to market its gemstones to well-heeled consumers 
Redcentric to Telford Homes
was enhanced substantially by the 2012 all-share deal that brought the luxury jewellery brand Faberge within its 
fold.
The gemstones have hitherto been sold through international wholesale auctions conducted in Jaipur (India), 
Singapore and Zambia's capital, Lusaka. However, Gemfields had to enter into protracted negotiations with 
Zambian authorities through much of last year. The dispute centred on the proposed locations of the company's 
emerald auctions after the Lusaka government insisted that all emeralds produced in Zambia should be sold 
domestically. Gemfields told us that it has come to an equitable solution with the government; a point borne out by a 
subsequent auction of high-quality emeralds in Lusaka that attracted record prices and volumes. Looking ahead, 
Gemfields has two more auctions scheduled before the close of its financial year in June, but the real shareholder 
focus is on the first auction from the highly promising Montepuez deposit. We think it could mark the start of a long-
term growth story. Buy. MR
72. IMPELLAM
Impellam (IPEL) was formed in 2008 through the merger of recruitment companies Carlisle and Corporate Services 
Group. Initially weighed down with debt and facing tough market conditions in the UK and US, prospects for the 
new business looked challenging. But several years of restructuring, management change and paying down debt 
have placed it on a firmer footing and Impellam began paying dividends in 2012.
Impellam focuses on specialist areas of the staffing market such as lawyers, teachers and accountants, and is the 
leading provider of locum doctors to the NHS. Recent full-year results showed the benefit of gradually improving 
end markets, with adjusted earnings per share up 5 per cent. But heavy provisioning for troublesome contracts left 
Impellam in the red on a statutory basis.
The City expects a slight dip in earnings per share this year, which looks rather dull compared with other small/mid-
cap recruiters that are broadly expected to grow earnings. This inferior growth explains the laggard performance of 
Impellam's shares versus peers and its lower rating. Impellam trades on only seven times forward earnings against 
peer Matchtech on around 15 times. Impellam still has some way to go to convince the market it can offer reliable 
earnings growth, but its lowly rating makes it a speculative buy. KG
71. TELFORD HOMES
Telford Homes (TEF) specialises in building residential apartments and some houses predominantly in the East 
End of London. And with demand from overseas and domestic buyers from landlords, owner occupiers to real 
estate investors, showing no signs of abating, Telford's progress has been little short of meteoric.
Profits last year rose nearly three-fold, and in normal trading conditions trading at nearly twice book value, the 
shares might look expensive. But conditions are far from normal, with strong demand from investors looking for a 
safe haven in an appreciating asset. Many sales are made before the foundations are in place, and the group has 
considerable earnings visibility. Targeted sales for the year to March 2015 are already more than 80 per cent 
secured, while over 60 per cent of sales for 2016 are in the bag. Investors in the shares are also starting to see the 
benefits of a progressive dividend policy. The half-year dividend was lifted by 85 per cent but is still three times 
covered by after-tax earnings. The shares are up nearly 250 per cent since our buy tip (101p, 22 April 2010), but 
with such vibrant growth and a fast increasing dividend, we remain buyers. JC

Here is a selection of today's business press headlines.
The fall in engineering company Babcock's (BAB) share price is overdone, Danny Fortson argued in his Inside the 
City column in the Sunday Times. The fall was partly because of the rights issue to pay for the takeover of 
helicopter operator Avincis but investors also think Peter Rogers, Babcock's Chief Executive, has overpaid. Fortson 
said that Avincis has struck deals in recent months that will make the price seem better value. Babcock can also 
refinance Avincis's debt more cheaply. There could also be an announcement on March 31st about deals to 
maintain the Magnox nuclear reactors and London's fire engines. Fortson gives Rogers the benefit of the doubt.
Buy shares of Electrocomponents (ECM) and hold on to them, the Mail on Sunday's Midas column advised. After 
suffering during the recession, the electrical parts supplier is back on track and is set to publish an upbeat trading 
statement on April 3rd. The company has invested in e-commerce to make it easier for customers to order 
products. Smaller rivals that cannot compete on product range or delivery speed and have depleted stocks after 
struggling in the recession. The group should benefit from economic recovery and the increasing importance of 
electronics in everyday life.
EasyJet (EZJ) has been upgraded to hold by Questor in the Sunday Telegraph. The budget airline guided profit 
forecasts up last week, saying cost control and more customers paying to choose their seats had made results 
better than expected. EasyJet has got ahead of its rival Ryanair by charging for seat allocation and allowing 
customers to switch flights. Questor had advised selling the shares on concerns about slowing growth and price 
competition, advice it said was "poorly timed". The company has proved its pricing power.
Investors are too negative about Caracal Energy's (CRCL) announced merger with Transglobe, Danny Fortson 
wrote in the Sunday Times. Caracal operates in Chad while Transglobe's is in Egypt. Investors should welcome the 
spreading of risk as well as the combined company's growth opportunities but the shares have fallen 15 per cent 
since the announcement. Sellers think Caracal boss Gary Guidry has diluted them when he should have increased 
production and waited for Caracal to be bought. But bank finance would have been costly for a company so 
exposed to the corrupt Chad regime. The Transglobe deal makes Caracal less risky.
Trifast (TRI) is going in the right direction and should continue to do well after its shares rose 4 per cent per cent 
since Questor tipped them in August, the Mail on Sunday columnist said. The widget company has invested in 
quality control that has won the approval of companies it supplies, 40 of which are big multinationals. Chief

Executive Malcolm Diamond thinks there is scope to sell more products to these companies and to expand through 
acquisition. The expected 75 per cent increase in the 2014 dividend shows how confident he is.
BUSINESS PRESS HEADLINES:
As the Yuan weakens and the US Federal Reserve raises rates sooner than expected the risk exists that the flood 
of 'hot money' going into China suddenly reverses, according to research from three of the largest global 
brokerages. Citigroup, for one, has told clients to brace for another round of 'taper tantrum' such as the one which 
rocked emerging markets in 2012. This time, however, it is China which will be in the eye of the storm, The Daily 
Telegraph writes.
Tory peer and business guru Lord Heseltine believes the Bank of England should weigh up measures such as 
imposing a cap on lending. Setting a limit on how big a mortgage homeowners can take out, as a percentage of 
their salaries, might help to prevent a housing bubble, he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. Thus, 
homeowners who take out loans equivalent to 5.5 times their salary could constitute a major risk when interest rates 
increase, the former Deputy Prime Minister added, The Daily Mail reports.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, won a majority of 
votes in local elections held nationally over the weekend, according to exit polls. Nevertheless, the margin of victory 
is as yet unclear as is his party's control of major cities, in what some see as a referendum on his rule in an 
increasingly divided country, The Wall Street Journal Europe says.
Energy bosses will admit that their customer service has been poor, their bills confusing and complaints about them 
being poorly handled. Those are the main conclusions of what amounts to an extraordinary indictment of industry 
practices as per a frank assessment of their failures seen by The Times.
Royal Mail (RMG) faces a daunting week. Just as the company prepares to raise its prices for stamps and parcels 
government auditors are set to issue their verdict on the recent privatisation of the firm. They are expected to say 
that taxpayers lost in excess of GBP1bn. As well, the aforementioned price increases will leave the company open 
to criticism that it is taking advantage of the market dominance afforded by its monopoly position, The Times says.
Ex-Tesco (TSCO) Chief Terry Leahy has signed up to the board of Blackcircles.com, a digital service which allows 
customers to choose a fitting centre and then order online. The company has 1,200 tyre fitting centres, including 
400 franchised sites. Revenues were up by 20 per cent last year and the outfit is gearing up for a possible initial 
public offering later this year, according to The Daily Mail.

The future for Britain's airlines is still risky. Holiday companies are the safer bet
Britain's airlines and tourism sector delivered a number of surprise recovery stories last year. Budget airline easyJet 
(EZJ) stunned the market by doubling in size, while package holiday outfit Thomas Cook (TCG) found its way back 
from the brink of collapse.
But controversial regulatory decisions have marred the start of 2014. The Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) decision 
to reserve the right to order improvements at Heathrow and increase landing charges caused uproar. The airport 
promised to appeal against the decision, labelling the measures "draconian". The decision to build a third runway at 
the airport could also cause the sector grief as it would, in time, intensify competition for passenger traffic among 
short-haul carriers.
The muddy regulatory future for Heathrow could impact International Consolidated Airlines (IAG), which owns 
British Airways. The shares rose sharply on recovery hopes last year, and the gains have continued, thanks in part 
to strong passenger numbers for December. Even though market conditions were largely flat in 2013, the airline 
mustered a 7.3 per cent increase in group premium traffic. Its troubled Spanish peer Iberia also completed its 
restructuring last year, leaving IAG looking a much lower-risk investment than a year ago.
The international airline market continues to struggle. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut the credit rating of 
Australian airline Qantas to 'junk' status in December, and Moody's did the same at the start of January. The 
Australian market has been dogged by increased competition and Qantas was forced to issue a profit warning at 
the end of 2013. Australia's travel companies have been accused of complacency, which doesn't bode well for long-
haul carriers operating in the country.
Back home, easyJet's aim is to capture more market share from its competitors. Following its largely unpredicted 
recovery last year, it hopes to distance itself from stricken Stanstead-based Ryanair (RYA) by improving customer 
service and introducing reserved seating. These measures will help the airline make good on some long-standing 
criticisms and satisfy consumer demand, helping it consolidate the short-haul market. The snag is that the 
company's shares have virtually doubled in the past year, leaving it vulnerable to any reversal in what remains an 
extremely volatile sector. Broker Liberum Capital reckons shares in the budget-airline sector more generally are due 
a correction.
Tourism sector still faces flight risk
Another risk is posed by the fall out from the torrential British weather during December and January. The power 
outage and ensuing chaos at Gatwick on Christmas Eve is predicted to swell the airlines' costs, if compensation 
has to be paid out. However, an ongoing investigation by the CAA could rule the airport was the one at fault for "not 
providing adequate customer service". In this case, the airlines would be reimbursed for any customer payouts.
The fortunes of British travel and holiday companies look better by comparison. Thomas Cook is still dedicated to 
cutting costs. It had cut its net debt in half by the end of last year and even managed a marginal increase in 
revenues for the year to September. The departure of non-executive director and ex-Co-op chief Peter Marks 
signalled further confidence: the recovery plan is well under way and he considers his job done. Meanwhile, leisure 
group Tui Travel's (TT.) outperformance of targets can be attributed to growth in margins. After suffering a 
substantial loss in France last year, when violence broke out in popular French holiday destinations Egypt and 
Tunisia, the group still managed to deliver cost savings more quickly than expected.
It's notable how few investors predicted last year's turnaround in airlines - and how many market commentators are 
sceptical now. We still think holiday companies are a better bet, as recovery plans will continue into 2015. But a 
watchful eye on budgets will still be a top priority for all involved.

FAVOURITES
While tour operators inevitably carry risks that are by nature unpredictable - natural disaster being the obvious 
example - we are still bullish about recent tip Tui TravelBuy, 340p, 12 Sep 2013 Buy, 340p, 12 Sep 2013) and its 
arch-rival Thomas Cook. With its shares up more than three-fold over the past 12 months, the latter has shown 
itself capable of achieving its recovery plan.
OUTSIDERS
Cruise operator Carnival is still our outsider this year. Its recovery from the Concordia and Triumph disasters aside, 
market guidance is still overzealous. Sluggish growth is forecast for the cruising sector as a whole, and the 
company's margins are uncertain.

RESULTS: Leisure airline group Dart is still growing fast, yet the shares trade at a discount to those of heavyweight 
rivals
Despite the hottest summer in years, Dart Group's (DTG) leisure airline Jet2.com still whisked 4.1 passengers away 
from its northern heartland during the six months to end-September; that's 13 per cent more than last year. Group 
profits surged over a third in the period and - while focusing on summer breaks means losses during the seasonally 
quieter second half are likely to swell - bosses are "cautiously optimistic" about the full-year outcome.
Canaccord Genuity is, too. The broker forecasts full-year adjusted pre-tax profit of GBP41.2m, giving adjusted EPS 
of 21.5p (from GBP37.6m and 19.8p in 2013).
As usual, much of the demand is being driven by Dart's package holiday business Jet2holidays. The number of 
passengers buying popular all-inclusive deals doubled again and revenue her soared by 110 per cent to over 
GBP380m. Given most of them use Dart's planes, then the 19 per cent surge in airline revenue to GBP463m is 
unsurprising.
Demand outstripped seat capacity growth and more travellers are heading for the Mediterranean and Canary 
Islands where ticket yields are better. Dart is selling more extras like travel insurance and car hire, too.
Business at the less glamorous distribution and logistics operation was, however, disappointing. Contract losses at 
the end of last year, volatile demand from supermarkets and increased investment, all helped to trim operating profit 
there.

Find out which shares today's quality papers are tipping
EasyJet (EZJ) on Tuesday took a page out of Ryanair's book by unveiling a special dividend which led to a more 
than doubling of its dividend yield to six per cent, thanks to its 50 per cent jump in pre-tax profits for the year ended 
September. Is that where the similarities end? After all, easyJet sees none of the demand weakness which its Irish 
rival has been reporting of late. That may be because a third of easyJet's capacity touches on France, Italy and 
Switzerland, where available seats overall are still expected to fall this winter (compared with the general intra-
European rise), allowing the UK carrier to up its capacity and grab shares. Ryanair, nevertheless, retains cost 
advantages, and will fight back. Thus, another third of easyJet's capacity competes with its Irish rival on a city-pair 
basis although under 5 per cent in terms of direct routes. EasyJet shares have also outflown its rival's and, on 13 
times 2013-14 earnings, are no longer cheaper. The gain is deserved. Still, going forward, Ryanair may yet have an 
edge left, says the Financial Times' Lex column (Last IC rating: Hold, 19 Nov Hold, 19 Nov).
Investors in Afren (AFR) are content following Tuesday's drilling report which suggested that the possible reserves 
within its Ogo resource could be four times larger than had been thought, at 774m barrels of oil equivalent. This 
would make it bigger than Afren's existing Ebok field off Nigeria and the biggest discovery Afren has made to date. 
A cautious note from RBCaCapital Markets, though, makes clear that more detail is needed on what exactly is 
there, in terms of the oil and gas mix. The main focus for Afren has been its assets in aKurdish Iraq. The completion 
of the pipeline into Turkey shortly would allow its Barda Rash field to be brought up to production of 35,000 barrels 
a day. The shares were about 120p in the summer. Although Ogo is a strong positive, until the outlook is clearer 
caution seems a wise approach, says The Times' Tempus (Last IC rating: Buy, 27 Aug Buy, 27 Aug).

Business press headlines:
Barack Obama made a personal appeal to leading senators on Tuesday to postpone new sanctions on Iran. The 
move came on the eve of crucial nuclear talks. However, the US president still faces fierce opposition from many 
Republicans in Congress. The US administration had initially appeared to win some political breathing space over 
its nuclear negotiations after a leading Republican senator left a meeting with Obama and said that no new 
sanctions were likely until at least next month, the Financial Times says.

A GBP480m contract to supply 12 British-built helicopters to India was on the brink of collapse last night after a 
bribery scandal prompted Delhi to abandon the deal. Executives from AgustaWestland, Britain's only helicopter 
manufacturer, were scheduled to meet India's Defence Ministry in Delhi today in a last-ditch effort to rescue the 
deal which, since February, has been overshadowed by corruption allegations, according to The Times.
The number of households that they are struggling to make ends meet each month has risen by more than 800,000 
compared to a year ago, research shows. The soaring cost of living has left an estimated 3.5m households without 
enough income to cover all their bills every month - a rise of 30 per cent from 2.7m last year, according to a report 
from Legal & General. The figure is now equivalent to almost a fifth (18 per cent) of all households compared to one 
in 8 just a year ago, adding weight to Labour leader Ed Miliband's claim that Britain is facing a cost of living crisis 
despite the recovery in economic growth, The Daily Mail says.
The US would impose a one-time 20 per cent tax on an estimated $2trn of cash held overseas by American 
multinationals under a proposal from Democrats on the Senate finance committee that would reshape international 
tax policy. The proposal by Max Baucus, the veteran Montana lawmaker who chairs the panel, was unveiled on 
Tuesday as a way to stoke momentum for a sweeping rewrite of the US tax code, which is facing uncertain political 
prospects, the Financial Times writes.
The Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank last night pledged that it would maintain its $85bn-a-month asset 
purchase scheme. Ben Bernanke, in one of his final speeches before handing over to Chairman-elect Janet Yellen, 
said that the Fed's Open Market Committee "remains committed to maintaining highly accommodative policies for 
as long as they are needed", The Times reports.
Investment banking giant JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM) last night signed a $13bn (GBP8bn) agreement with the 
US government to settle claims that it had overstated the quality of mortgages sold to investors in the run-up to the 
financial crash. The civil settlement - the largest ever reached between a government and a company - marks the 
end of weeks of tense negotiations between representatives of JP Morgan, the largest US bank, and government 
agencies under pressure to hold banks accountable for wrongdoing that led to America's housing crisis, The 
Scotsman explains.
The Co-op Bank's GBP1.5bn recapitalisation could be "at risk", the troubled lender was warned as it continued to 
face the fall-out from damaging revelations about the private life of its disgraced former chairman. Lord Myners, the 
former City minister, warned the growing scandal over the sex life and alleged drug use by Paul Flowers, the Co-op 
Bank's chairman until his resignation in June, risked scuppering a rescue deal for the bank and could lead the 
lender's backers to rethink the terms of recent recapitalisation plan, The Daily Telegraph says.

RESULTS: It's worth staying aboard easyJet following record profits and another special dividend
Concerns about slowing growth and profit warnings at Ryanair (RYA) have kept easyJet's (EZJ) shares in a holding 
pattern since August. But investors need not worry. Full-year pre-tax profit climbed to a record high and reached the 
top end of City estimates. Management will reward shareholders with a special dividend worth 44.1p per share, too, 
increasing the yield to almost 6 per cent.
With legacy airlines still deserting unprofitable short-haul operations, easyJet increased capacity by 3.3 per cent 
and flew nearly 61 million passengers over the 12 months. Revenue per seat rose by 7 per cent to GBP62.58 and 
an expensive advertising campaign, and the introduction of allocated seating, helped drive profit per seat up 46 per 
cent to GBP7.03. That easily offset a 3.9 per cent increase in unit costs, excluding fuel; mostly reflecting higher 
airport charges and de-icing costs. But there is turbulence to negotiate. Repeating last year's post-Olympics boom 
won't be easy - Easter falling in the group's second half will cut revenue per seat by 150 basis points (bps), and 
travel restrictions to Egypt will slice off another 70bps. First-half revenue will rise only "very slightly" and industry 
capacity, which fell 4 per cent last winter, is expected to grow by 2 per cent this year.
Investec Securities expects pre-tax profit of GBP529.6m in 2014, giving adjusted EPS of 103p (from 100p in 2013).

Find out which shares today's quality papers are tipping
News that Merlin Entertainments will accelerate the timetable for its initial public offering because of strong demand 
is unsurprising. There is pent up demand amongst both households and institutional investors for such household 
names with strongly growing business units. Nevertheless, there are sceptics given the firm's intention to deploy the 
funds - GBP200m in cash - raised to reduce debt. As well, at two per cent the dividend yield is nowhere near that of 
Royal Mail at the time of its IPO. Nor are its private equity backers likely to be as generous as the government on 
the valuation. Even so, even at the top end of the proposed IPO range the company's valuation in terms of 
enterprise value-to-ebitda (one measure of operating profits) would put it on a similar footing to Whitbread and 
InterContinental. Given its international potential and the strength of its brands and track record, retail investors 
should hurry to apply for shares, The Times' Tempus writes (Last IC rating: One to watch, 23 Oct One to watch, 23 
Oct).
After falling by almost 25 per cent from their recent highs in early August shares of Ryanair (RYA) may look cheap, 
but that may not be so. The company may only be experiencing the early stages of an earnings decline as it faces 
the insidious impact of operational leverage on profitability, in which case the shares could have much further to fall. 
Following the crisis the firm cut its fixed costs to the bone. Hence, when traffic recovered its profits promptly soared, 
to reach 651m for the full-year ended in March 2013. Over the last six month, however, average fare per passenger 
declined by 1.7 per cent. Furthermore, average fares could fall 9 per cent in the third quarter, and 11 per cent in the 
fourth quarter, as companies in its space seek to defend market share, in turn pricing aggressively, hurting margins.
Taking a simple three-year trailing earnings figure of 32 cents per share - which seems prudent given the sales 
slowdown - would put shares on 16.6 times forward earnings, and that begins to look expensive for a company 
which pays no dividend and whose earnings look under threat. Sell, says The Daily Telegraph's Questor column.
Just as the general economic climate is improving, Ryanair (RYA) on Monday reported tougher price competition 
and softer economic conditions, plus adverse exchange rates. Those first two factors cited are puzzling. Yes, 
industry seat capacity is rising, led by low-cost carriers while some flag carriers continue to cut back. Yet it is not 
soaring away. Hence, two possible explanations come to mind. The first is that fliers are either fed up with Ryanair's 
service. The second is that the carrier is deliberating taking a market share fight to its rivals. The company's Chief 
Executive, Mr O'Leary, though, points to customer growth to rebut the first theory and calls the latter "an outrageous 
slur".
Merlin Entertainments, Ryanair
Ryanair is responding to conditions, he says. In any case, should Ryanair compete fiercely on prices in the near-
term, this is likely to push down industry margins. That, in turn, may spur consolidation. The result will be the Irish 
carrier having to give up some short-term profit, but it may stand to benefit longer-term, with share gains in a 
rationalised European short-haul market. It is a strategy that Ryanair's low cost structure and solid balance sheet 
permits, says the Financial Times' Lex column (Last IC rating: Hold, 4 Nov Hold, 4 Nov).

Business press headlines:
Shares in UBS and Credit Suisse, Switzerland's two largest banks, fell sharply on Monday after the Swiss Finance 
Minister said that the country's leverage rules, already among the toughest in the world, should be tightened further. 
Under Switzerland's existing regulations, both banks need to push their leverage ratios - a measure of a bank's 
capital in relation to total assets - above four per cent by 2019. However, in an interview with Schweiz am Sonntag, 
the Swiss newspaper, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said that this level might be insufficient, the Financial Times 
reports.
The cost of borrowing will have to rise a year earlier than planned, a think-tank has forecast, dealing a blow to the 
Bank of England's (BoE) key economic policy. In its latest health check of the UK economy, the National Institute of 
Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said that interest rates would rise from their historic low of 0.5 per cent in 
the second half of 2015, The Times reports.
Greece is not at "war" with the European Union and International Monetary Fund, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras 
said on the eve of the latest review by the lenders to decide whether to pay the next tranche of bailout loans. 
Inspectors from the EU, IMF and the European Central Bank, known collectively as the "Troika", resume a visit to 
Athens on Tuesday to check how far the country has come in meeting its bailout commitments, including 
privatisations, The Daily Telegraph explains.
Millions of people must "drastically" cut the amount of water they use or their prices will rise, a water supplier has 
warned. MPs have condemned a plan by Thames Water to force Londoners to install smart meters in their homes 
to limit the amount of water they use and prevent the city running out of water. Thames Water said getting people to 
use smart meters would encourage them to cut down their use and limit their bills, The Daily Telegraph says.
The president of the UK's leading business group has attacked "factually incorrect, emotive debates around 
immigration", saying that the opposition to migrants entering the UK is affecting the economic recovery. Speaking at 
the CBI's annual conference on Monday morning, Sir Michael Rake said Britain must show it is open to immigration, 
and demanded the UK remain in the European Union, The Daily Telegraph.
Poundland's owner Warburg Pincus, the private equity firm that bought it for GBP200m three years ago, is 
understood to be considering an IPO of the business in the first half of 2014. Poundland declined to comment on 
speculation that Rothschild had been lined up to lead the retailer's growth plans, which include doubling the number 
of stores to 1,000. Other advisers are likely to be brought in to handle a share sale as the public listings market 
takes off, the Daily Express writes.

RESULTS: A price war in Europe will slash Ryanair's profits this year
Ryanair's (RYA) share price plunged as much as 13 per cent after the Irish budget airline issued its second profits 
warning in as many months. Having already lowered expectations in September, chief executive Michael O'Leary 
now expects full-year net profit of only 500m-520m (GBP423m-440m) compared with 570m-600m before. More 
worrying, perhaps, is speculation in the Square Mile that Ryanair's notoriously unpopular style rather than a wider 
industry decline is to blame.
If true, it probably explains why Ryanair has just upgraded its website, softened some of its draconian rules and cut 
charges. It has slashed fares, too, in an effort to pack its planes. Average fares, already down 2 per cent during the 
first half due to the summer heatwave, French strikes and weak pound, will slump by 9 per cent slump in the third 
quarter, warns Mr O'Leary and by up to 10 per cent in the last three months of the financial year. Yet Ryanair will 
continue to rely heavily on charging for reserved seating, priority boarding and higher credit card fees. So-called 
ancillary revenue generated 713m of revenue during the period, up 22 per cent, and a 5 charge for allocated 
seating from February will help full-year numbers. So, too, will further cost cuts during the second half.
Broker Deutsche Bank expects full-year pre-tax profit of 659m, giving EPS of 41A, up from 651m and 39A in 2013.

After exiting a purple patch, both the airline industry and investors should buckle up for bumpy ride
A double-whammy of events in recent weeks has brought the seemingly unstoppable airline sector back down to 
earth with a jolt. Pricing in western military strikes on Syria had already sent the price of jet fuel rocketing again, and 
now a profit warning from the usually dependable Ryanair has thrown the reliability of rivals' earnings estimates into 
doubt. Inevitably, there have been repercussions for share prices, but ambitious expansion plans mean there could 
be consequences in the long term, too.
Out of fuel
Clearly, the industry's rapid ascent had to end eventually. Between September last year and early August 2013, 
shares in Ryanair (RYA), easyJet (EZJ) and International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) had risen on average 127 per 
cent. Both low-cost carriers happily mopped up customers left behind by the numerous airlines that went bust 
during the recession, and an outbreak of capacity discipline elsewhere certainly justified a re-rating. Even British 
Airways-owner IAG defeated Spanish unions and is gradually repairing Iberia.
But all of a sudden, the future looks a little less rosy. The price of oil has topped $100 (GBP64) a barrel for the past 
two months and recently made a five-year high. Some analysts believe any direct western intervention in Syria 
could push the price through $120. That could be disastrous for the airline industry, particularly if the west gets 
bogged down in a lengthy conflict.
Refined from crude, the cost of jet fuel is pegged to oil prices and, after a period of relative stability, has risen back 
above $1,000 per metric tonne. That's significant because fuel accounts for about a third of an airline's operating 
costs, and the impact on margins can take time to offset. IAG spent over 6bn (GBP5bn) on it last year, and 45 per 
cent of Ryanair's budget will go on fuel in 2014, according to broker Investec Securities.
Capacity conundrum
Of course, volatility here is nothing new and carriers have already put in place plans to offset cost inflation. 
Hundreds of jets with more fuel-efficient engines are on order and airlines are flogging more lucrative extras - so-
called ancillary revenue, such as allocated seating and insurance. Legacy airlines, meanwhile, are busy trimming 
bloated wage bills. That said, unless these extra planes are packed, yields will suffer.
Airlines switch on the warning lights
While the era of extreme under-supply may be over, anticipated capacity growth, in the near term at least, appears 
relatively modest. Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Irish broker Davy, expects relatively low supply over the next year 
or two and a period of more managed growth thereafter. Air traffic experts at Eurocontrol believe supply will 
definitely pick up in 2014. They pencil in 2.8 per cent capacity growth next year, and an annual average of 2.3 per 
cent out to 2019.
Others, such as UBS, have recently raised concerns about large short-haul capacity additions in Germany and the 
UK, key markets for both Ryanair and easyJet. IAG faces possible headwinds, too. Global capacity growth will 
easily outstrip European performance, driven by rapid progress in emerging markets which might limit yield growth 
on long-haul routes.
Warning lights - on
Capacity issues will play out further down the road. Of more immediate concern, however, is Ryanair. Its boss 
Michael O'Leary, already spitting feathers after the UK Competition Commission essentially killed any hope he had 
of buying Aer Lingus (AERL), issued a shock profit warning. The usually ebullient Irishman guided down 
expectations for full-year net profit to the lower end of the forecast range of between 570m and 600m. If business 
doesn't improve, it could be worse.
Higher fuel costs, the timing of Easter and striking French air traffic controllers had already hit first-quarter profit. A 
summer heat wave and strong pound haven't helped since, although there will still be a small increase in first-half 
profit. Yet, it is the emerging trend that's disturbing here.
There's been a "perceptible dip in forward fares and yields into September, October and November", warns Mr 
O'Leary, blaming austerity, currencies, price competition and capacity increases in the UK, Scandinavia, Spain and 
Ireland. In response, Ryanair is selectively cutting winter capacity which will trim 500,000 off the annual traffic 
target. It is slashing fares in these markets, too. And that is, perhaps, the nub of it.
Canary in the mine?
"O'Leary is preparing the market for a price war in Europe, so is reining in yield expectations," reckons Rob Byde, 
transport analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "He's clearly concerned about analysts overcooking their numbers." If right, 
that's sensible, and perhaps justifies taking some money off the table. After all, Ryanair's share price has surged 83 
per cent over the past year, and a correction at some point was inevitable.
But the City senses this could be just a pause. "Don't overplay the profit warning," urges Mr Furlong. "It's a 
readjustment of expectations, but we're not bearish. There isn't suddenly a wall of supply about to hit the market." 
Ryanair has, however, called things early in the past, which raises concerns that its problems are not isolated, but 
industry-wide.
Clearly, there are one-off factors such as austerity which impact all, but that is nothing new. And sterling strength 
hits Ryanair harder given it has to convert a lot of revenue back into euros, its reported currency. True, Aer Lingus 
also blamed good weather for a drop in short-haul traffic last month, but monthly statistics from easyJet reveal it 
basked in the glorious sunshine - both passenger numbers and load factor improved. Expect confirmation in next 
month's trading update, with more useful data on trends in November's full-year results.

IC VIEW:
Conditions within the European airline sector are difficult to judge. Much depends on whether carriers, both no-frills 
and network, maintain discipline around supply. But even analysts admit getting a clean number on capacity in the 
region is difficult given the aggressive restructuring of short-haul operations under way at legacy carriers. 
Admittedly, the magnitude of the sector re-rating took us by surprise, and we still have trouble reconciling current 
multiples with near-term headwinds of fuel and capacity. A pause for breath seems highly likely, at least until we 
have greater clarity on earnings over the next month or two.
A
FAVOURITES:
Thomson-owner TUI Travel (TT.) is our top pick right now. Its share price has fallen sharply since early August 
despite a good third quarter, and a forward PE ratio of 11 fails to reflect above-target profit growth. Technical 
indicators are favourable, too, and earnings upgrades could accompany a pre-close update in a few weeks time. 
With the shares trading at a discount to those of its Irish rival, easyJet looks the more assured of the two budget 
carriers right now - although the period of rapid growth looks to have run its course. And don't write off Ryanair. 
Even if the worst happens, Mr O'Leary has promised to complete the 1bn (GBP840m) programme of share buy-
backs and special dividends by March 2015, as planned. That should underpin the share price, which could 
rebound if the recent slip-up is proved to be a blip. Lufthansa (LHA) has fallen since our buy tip16.71, 30 May 2013 
16.71, 30 May 2013), but a huge cost-cutting exercise is paying off and the shares trade at an unfair discount to 
those of other flag carriers.
A
OUTSIDERS:
IAGHold, 320p, 8 Aug 2013 Hold, 320p, 8 Aug 2013) is finally getting a grip on Iberia, the troublesome Spanish 
carrier that gave chief executive Willie Walsh nightmares, and there's clear evidence of a turnaround. Yet the 
shares have more than doubled inside a year, even after the correction, and Iberia still carries plenty of execution 
risk, especially among the unions, and at newly acquired budget carrier Vueling. Significant growth in premium yield 
may be harder to come by, too, and an objection from the US Department of Justice to US Airways' merger with 
American Airlines could remove a potentially rich source of additional income. IAG already has a lucrative joint 
venture with American, and any tie-up with US Air would likely drive extra volume through it.
A
THE BROKER'S VIEW:
Airlines switch on the warning lights
European airline stocks are up 70 per cent in the past year, but we think that there is still selected good value in the 
sector. Demand for leisure and business travel continues to recover with the slow turnaround in the European 
economy. Capacity growth is muted with most airlines still only cautiously adding more seats to their networks. Jet 
fuel prices are high and clearly there is a potential risk of a spike in the oil price if the situation in Syria deteriorates.
However, most airlines have hedged their planned usage to the middle of next year, and fares are rising which is 
helping to compensate. Lufthansa (Buy, target price 21) is our preferred flag carrier. The stock has underperformed 
the sector, yet its revenues are diverse with its large and market-leading cargo, aircraft maintenance and flight 
catering divisions operating successfully alongside its passenger airlines. It also has the strongest balance sheet of 
its close peers, a well-funded aircraft fleet replacement plan and, in most years, it pays an attractive dividend. IAG's 
(Buy, target price 360p) turnaround is gathering pace, supported by strong transatlantic demand at BA and job cuts 
at Iberia, but we see more upside at this time with Lufthansa.
Our preferred low-cost carrier is Ryanair (Buy, target price 9). We believe that its recent profit warning, citing 
weaker fare yields, was interpreted too negatively by the market. Its unit cost advantage is sector leading and we 
think that the airline is well-placed to take further market share as flag carriers continue to restructure and scale-
back European short-haul operations. Management has also committed to return 1bn of capital to shareholders in 
the next 18 months through share buy-backs and special dividends. Trading at easyJet (Hold, target price 1,500p) 
has been very strong in the past two years, but its stock has outperformed and, in our view, is now up with events.

Business press headlines courtesy of Weekend City Press Review:
Fed puzzle after mixed jobs data
US jobs data for August were weaker than expected: the US added only 169,000 jobs, while the percentage of the 
population in the labour force fell to 63.2 per cent, the lowest since August 1978. Fewer Americans were seeking 
work drove the jobless rate down to 7.3 per cent: unemployment figures are closer to the Fed's goal, but only 
because fewer are seeking jobs. The Fed will need to decide when and whether at all it begins its 'tapering' of asset 
purchases. [Financial Times, pp.1, 5]
Zoopla fuels City's GBP40bn float frenzy
Six-year old property website Zoopla is considering a float that could see it valued at over GBP1bn, in the vanguard 
of a wave of flotations that could be worth as much GBP40bn: estate agent Foxtons is set for a debut shortly, and 
Merlin Entertainments are due to confirm a GBP4bn float in the next few weeks. Sunday Times sources suggest 
that a dozen more will follow next year, including House of Fraser, Card Factory and Appliances Online, to be 
possibly followed by Urenco, EE, Saga and TSB. Daily Mail & General Trust owns 50.1 per cent of Zoopla. [Sunday 
Times, p.3.1]
Royal Mail sale delivers GBP2,000 to every postie
SThree, Vodafone , Barratt Developments, Ryanair
Final approval of the Royal Mail's GBP3bn market listing could come this week, as could the GBP5bn Lloyds 
Banking Group government shares sale. Chief executive Moya Greene is to set aside 10 per cent of the business to 
distribute among 150,000 staff, equal to GBP2,000 each at a valuation of GBP3bn. Analysts expect a regular 50 per 
cent annual profits dividend payment to investors, after a special payout at the end of the financial year in March. In 
an attempt to curtail planned strikes by the CWU, Royal Mail has offered a pay deal higher than the current 8.6 per 
cent over three years, but reliant on a cap on pensionable pay at 5 per cent. [Sunday Times, p.3.1]
Serco risks bar from MoD contract
Currently under investigation for overcharging the Ministry of Justice and falsifying transfer documentation, 
outsourcer Serco (SRP) is in danger of being excluded from a defence outsourcing deal. Serco is part of a 
consortium led by CH2M Hill which is bidding against Bechtel, PricewaterhouseCoopers and PA Consulting for the 
running of Defence, Equipment & Support, the MoD's jets, tanks and warships procurer, with a GBP15bn budget. 
[Sunday Times, p.3.3]
Bank slams bubble 'hype'
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Bank of England MPC member Paul Fisher dismissed fears of a housing 
bubble caused by the Help to Buy scheme. He said that there was an increase in housing supply as the market 
picks up, and the scheme will translate into a supply-side response and not into price increases; talk of London 
hotspots was 'hype'. He said that forward guidance was intended to boost business and household confidence. 
[Sunday Times, p.3.1]
Davey woos China over nuclear plants
Energy secretary Ed Davey is traveling to Beijing this month seeking Chinese backing for the troubled GBP200m 
low-carbon overhaul of the energy industry. EDF is in negotiations with the UK government over guaranteed 35-
year prices for power from, and with China General Power Group for investment in, two nuclear reactors it plans at 
Hinckley Point. CGPG will take a 50 per cent stake, but only if it is granted operational control. The government 
wants up to 12 new reactors, but the leading utilities need external funding. [Sunday Times, p.3.2]
Gas 'fudge' could cost UK GBP1bn
Analysis commissioned by the government from Redpoint indicates that the decision by the government not to 
invest GBP750m over ten years in subsidizing new gas storage facilities could cost consumers up to GBP1bn in 
import costs should gas demand be high, as it was in the last harsh winter - the UK has 15 days' worth of storage. 
Plans including Centrica's (CNA) GBP1.4bn Baird store in a North Sea gas field and Stag Energy's Gateway store 
under the Irish Sea are expected to be shelved. [Sunday Telegraph, p.B1]
Disney rival Merlin aims to conjure IPO for small investors
Merlin Entertainments, owner of Legoland, Madame Tussauds, Sea Life Centres, the London Dungeon and the 
London Eye, and the world's second biggest attractions owner behind Disney, is to offer a GBP3bn market listing 
before Christmas, and intends to offer more than 10 per cent of its shares to small investors, taking advantage of its 
brands' profiles. Merlin originally shelved a flotation in 2010, and sold a 28 per cent stake to CVC Capital Partners 
to buy out Dubai International Capital and Blackstone, and have expanded into Asia: 14 per cent of revenues now 
come from Asia-Pacific. [Sunday Telegraph, p.B1]
Returning TSB vows to be local bank benefiting local businesses
The TSB brand is set to return to the high street on Monday, after an 18-year absence, formed from the 631 Lloyds 
Banking Group branches obliged to be sold by EU competition ruling. Chief executive Paul Pester insists the bank 
will bring back traditional banking, and vows not to use customers' money for investment banking. Lloyds CEO 
Antonio Horta-Osorio says the brand has "all the conditions to be a very strong challenger on the high street".

CBI calls time on 'wear and tear' UK
John Cridland, director-general of the CBI, warned that the UK has underinvested in infrastructure for a prolonged 
period and is seeing 'wear and tear', and falling behind- the UK is now 28th worldwide in terms of infrastructure 
quality - behind Saudi Arabia and Barbados. The CBI proposes the establishment of a new National Infrastructure 
Commission to identify needs up to 30 years ahead, moving away from short-term political expediency. The 
government says it will be investing GBP300bn over the course of the next parliament in long-term infrastructure 
developments. [Sunday Telegraph, p.B3]

PRESS TIPS:
Despite having fallen by almost 17 per cent since their May highs shares of British Land (BLND) are not cheap nor 
is this the time to buy them, rather the opposite. That is, above all, because of the significant shift witnessed in 
some of the main pillars underpinning the British property market as credit markets tighten, in part as a result of 
tapering by the US Fed. Martin Allen, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: "We expect tapering of US quantitative 
easing over the next 12 months to reduce the liquidity in the global financial system on which property shares 
thrive." Then there is the over-heating of property prices in London's West End and the fact that the company is one 
of the most indebted within its sector. 
On Deutsche Bank analysis, the British Land net debt to net assets is 83 per cent, compared with the UK average 
of 61 per cent. Furthermore, the shares currently trade at about an 8 per cent discount to the 2013 forecast net 
asset value (NAV), compared to a long-term average discount at about 11 per cent. Finally, the shares have fallen 
through the technical support level of their 200-day moving average. It is time to take profits and the shares are 
downgraded to a sell, The Daily Telegraph's Questor team says (Last IC rating: Hold, 14 May Hold, 14 May).
EasyJet (EZJ), the airline group, yesterday reported strong growth in passenger numbers, about 230,000 more 
passengers flew on its planes in August when compared with the same month last year. Of particular interest, that 
stands in sharp contrast to some of its rivals, one of which -RyanAir, launched a profit warning just the day before. 
However, Questor thinks the rapid growth and more is already priced into the sky-high share rating, so it may be 
about time for a pullback. Thus, any slip up in traffic numbers may provoke an outsized reaction in the stock. 
Following a parabolic year to date rise of 61 per cent the shares now trade on a 2013 earnings multiple of 13.4 
times, well above the 12-month average earnings multiple of about 10.8 times. Investors are now paying more than 
2.4 times the net asset value for the shares, when the 12-month average is about 1.3 times. Yet the only gains that 
The Telegraph's Questor likes are those safely in the bank, so after an incredibly strong run easyJet is downgraded 
to a sell, from a buy (Last IC rating: Hold, 15 May Hold, 15 May).
AG Barr (BAG) is not sitting around moping after the failure of its planned "nil premium" soft drinks merger with 
Britvic this summer. Proof of that is its recent invitation to analysts for a visit of its new production and warehouse 
facility at Milton Keynes. The analysts were generally impressed, given that the project came in on budget and 
British Land, easyJet , AG Barr
slightly ahead of schedule despite other distractions. The plant takes some of the pressure off Barr's Cumbernauld 
facility, where production has been constrained by a shortage of capacity. It also helps the Scottish company's drive 
southwards with brands that sell well there, such as KA, Rubicon and Rockstar. That comes ahead of the 
company's interim figures, which are due out in a couple of weeks. Barr shares have traditionally traded on a high 
multiple - about 21 times' earnings - because of the company's perceived strengths. Expensive, but not in the 
longer term, writes The Times' Tempus (Last IC rating: Hold, 22 Mar Hold, 22 Mar).

Business press headlines:
Government borrowing costs in the US and Europe surged as investors became more optimistic that the developed 
world has embarked on a period of sustained and rapid growth and anticipated that central banks will increase 
interest rates earlier than previously thought. Yields on sovereign debt, which move inversely to prices, broke above 
key levels in Europe and the US, even after Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, warned about the 
fragility of the Eurozone's nascent economic recovery, the Financial Times writes.
An extensive programme of repairs could be needed across North Sea oil and gas operations in light of emerging 
evidence of causes of last year's Elgin gas leak, experts have warned. A corrosive drilling fluid may have been to 
blame for the leak at the Total-operated platform, which went on for a month and a half before being stopped and 
contributed to a slump in North Sea production last year, according to The Daily Telegraph.
Rolls-Royce will help Russia's state-controlled nuclear energy group build its reactors in Britain as the Government 
casts its net ever wider to gets its stalled nuclear programme off the ground. Rosatom, which was formed out of the 
Soviet ministry responsible for the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, has hired the engineer to advise on getting its 
technology licensed by British regulators, The Times reports.
Speaking at the CBI Scotland annual dinner in Glasgow, the BT chairman said he remains unconvinced that 
independence would be a good economic move for the Scottish. "The CBI is not convinced of the economic case 
for independence and has asked some important questions of the Scottish Government," Sir Mike Rake said, The 
Daily Telegraph reports.
The Suntory group, best known for its range of Japanese whisky, is close to agreeing a purchase of the iconic 
Ribena and Lucozade brands from British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline, according to industry sources. An 
announcement is expected within days, though a Suntory spokesman stressed that "nothing has been decided" at 
this stage. Analysts value the brands at around GBP1bn, though it is believed the final sum could exceed this, with 
some reports suggesting a price tag as high as GBP1.5bn, The Daily Telegraph says.
One million hard-pressed borrowers prepared to pay interest at up to 5,853 per cent have propelled Wonga.com 
into the league of Britain's biggest lenders after the controversial payday loan company lent as much money last 
year as Britain's biggest building society advanced in personal loans, The Guardian reports.

6 per cent in the UK and Ireland in the three months to the end of July. Northern Europe saw sales rise by 5 per

Transport operator Go-Ahead GroupGOG) has posted results 'slightly ahead' of management expectations after 
reporting record passenger levels in both rail and bus divisions. The bus division posted profits of GBP78.2m as it 
aims for GBP100m of operating profits by 2016 but the rail division is finding life tougher.
Budget airline easyJetEZJ) has been under pressure after rival Ryanair issued a profit warning yesterday but 
performance appears to have been solid enough in August when passenger numbers rose by 3.9 per cent and load 
factor by 1.1 per cent.
BetfairBET) saw revenues dip by 13 per cent in the three months to July although this was expected due to a lack 
of a major sporting tournament and also management's decision to concentrate on sustainable markets.
CommunisisCMS) is using a mixture of cash and paper to fund the GBP7.1m acquisition of Editions Publishing, a 
financial services focused marketing agency.
OTHER COMPANY NEWS:

which wants to raise GBP200m.

Recent buy recommendationMicroFocus InternationalMCRO) has announced the details of its return of cash to

Galiford TryGFRD) has secured construction contracts in the Midlands worth GBP48m in aggregate to build a 
dental hospital in Birmingham and an extension and refurbishment to a science library at the University of 
Nottingham. Buy.
KEY STORIES:
Budget carrier RyanairRYA) has lost altitude this morning after warning that soft trading in recent weeks there will 
be no upgrade to forecasts and indeed profits could come in at the lower end of the indicated 570m-600m range or 
even below that range if weakness persists. Ryanair's shares slumped more than 13 per cent on the news.
Financial services specialist Hargreaves LansdownHL.) continues to trade strongly. Full year results today showed

Equities are off colour again
Equities are off again as geopolitical concerns and the fear of QE tapering in the US continue to spook investors. 
The Trader Dominic Picarda is respecting the short term down trend but thinks another good buying opportunity will 
present itself before too long.
IC TIP UPDATES:
Industrial property specialist Hansteen HoldingsHSTN) is planning to acquire a 26 per cent stake in the Ashtenne 
Industrial Fund and also become its asset manager. Owner Warner EstatesWNER) announced it was appointing 
administrators after Aviva Investors changed the terms of its payment of the asset management fee for the 
Ashtenne fund, putting Warner into serious financial difficulty. The move by Hansteen represents a full circle for its 
main directors who made their names running the Ashtenne Industrial fund before selling it. We keep our buy on 
Hansteen.
Sell recommendation Paddy PowerPAP) has reported revenue growth across all its divisions in the first half, with 
particular strength in online and mobile channels. Revenues rose by 22 per cent and profits by 12 per cent although 
Irish retail sales suffered from adverse results, particularly at the Cheltenham Festival.
Northcote EnergyNCT) is acquiring a 25 per cent working interest in producing leases in Texas from AminexAEX) 
for around $450,000 in cash and shares. Buy.
Insurance investment specialist Randall & QuilterRQIH) has posted solid interim results showing a growth in 
revenues from GBP25.3m to GBP26.2m although profits dipped by a third due to prior year adjustments. During the 
first half the company completed an equity fundraising worth GBP24m to fund its participation in Lloyd's Syndicate 
1991. We keep our buy recommendation.
KEY STORIES:
Airline RynairRYA) has been told by the UK Competition Commission to reduce its stake in Irish rival Aer 
LingusAERL) from 29.8 per cent to 5 per cent, a process that the Competition Commission is proposing is 
undertaken by an independent third party. Ryanair has vowed to appeal against the decision.
Hansteen, Paddy Power, Ryanair, Ophir Energy & more
Recent trading at military countermeasures business ChemringCHG) has been tough, as expected, with revenue 
down from GBP165.1m to GBP142.8m in the past three months. The order book has risen by 6.7 per cent since 
April but, at GBP747.8m, is well down on the GBP909.9m level of the previous year.
APR EnergyAPR) has announced another 147MW of contract wins in Mozambique, Senegal and Indonesia 
alongside its interim results. Performance dipped in the first half as the company repositioned its assets in 
preparation for a ramp up in second half performance, which growing orders suggest is possible.
East African oil and gas play Ophir EnergyOPHR) has announced a further discovery of gas at Pweza-2 offshore 
Tanzania which confirms the extension of the field.
Half year results from 888 Holdings888) showed a 7 per cent improvement in revenues and a similar rise in 
adjusted earnings to $38.6m. It is experiencing rapid growth in mobile, which now represents 17 per cent of total 
revenues.

A summary of key company announcements expected in the coming week
Welcome to the week ahead, our summary of the forthcoming key company announcements. Companies are no 
longer obliged to notify the London Stock Exchange (LSE) of results and trading updates, so this list does not claim 
to be comprehensive. You can read company announcements at http://announce.ft.com and our daily online news 
summaries record all key company announcements and business press headlines.

Economics: Hometrack housing survey, net consumer credit data, data for net lending secured on dwellings, 
mortgage approvals data, M4 money supply figures, Confederation of British Industry reported sales data, 
Nationwide house prices data
Hammerson (HMSO) will have some reassuring to do when it posts half-year results on Monday. At 543p, its 
shares trade in line with last December's adjusted book value of 542p, even though the sale of its London office 
portfolio last year has left it a pure play on the underperforming retail sector.
Like the other big landlords, Hammerson owns major shopping centres and retail parks, which are proving more 
resilient than high-street shops as e-commerce grows. But the company's first-quarter figures were not encouraging 
- - occupancy fell from 97.1 per cent in March 2012 to 96.6 per cent a year later, largely due to its French operation. 
UK retail sales have shown signs of picking up lately, but it will be some time before that translates into higher rents 
- Land Securities noted last week that "the retail market remains challenging". Yet there is little danger that book 
value will fall - rents should at least be maintained, and the investment market for institutional-grade assets is 
strong. Brokerage Investec expects adjusted book value to creep up to 552p by the year end.

Barclays (BARC) will release half-year figures on Tuesday against a backdrop of yet more reputational misery. 
Earlier this month, the bank was fined $453m (GBP298m) after US authorities accused the lender of having 
manipulated the electricity markets in California and other US states from November 2006 to December 2008. That, 
of course, follows last year's GBP290m fine for Libor-rigging. Moreover, last month UK bank regulators named 
Barclays as one of the lenders facing a capital shortfall under the tougher Basel III rules - some GBP3bn, based on 
end-2012's figures. Still, the half-year numbers are likely to reveal progress. At the first-quarter stage, for example, 
there were no further charges for payment protection insurance mis-selling and bad debts have also continued to 
fall - the first-quarter's impairment charge fell 10 per cent year on year. Still, the lender is heavily exposed to volatile 
investment banking conditions and a weak UK retail banking market. So, with the shares at 319p - not that far 
below Investec Securities' full-year net tangible assets estimate of 354.2p - catalysts for significant further upside 
are hard to spot. The broker also expects full-year EPS of 24.1p. Hold.

British American Tobacco (BATS) is likely to report steady performance at the half-year stage, given that trading 
conditions haven't changed materially since a decent first quarter trading update in April. In fact, analysts at 
J.P.Morgan Cazenove believe the most important difference since the first quarter is in foreign exchange 
movements in emerging markets, and it is for this reason alone that they have cut full-year EPS estimates. For the 
half-year, JP Morgan expects group operating profit of GBP2.9bn, a 4 per cent rise in constant currency, and 
adjusted EPS of 108p, a 7 per cent rise, aided by the share buyback programme.
British American is good at using pricing power and cost savings to offset volume declines and keep profits and 
dividends growing at steady rate. A forward PE ratio of 15 isn't cheap, but there's a 4.4 per cent forecast dividend 
yield for 2013. Hold.

Equities are up, just
Shares are just clinging on to a positive start in London and The Trader Dominic Picarda remains optimistic, 
although rather than equities, gold has attracted his attention now.
IC TIP UPDATES:
Sell recommendation CarpetrightCPR) continues to battle against tough end market conditions, posting a 1.9 per 
cent drop in UK like for like sales in the 12 weeks to 20 July and total sales decline of 3.3 per cent in the UK market. 
Europe was even worse, posting a 10.6 per cent drop in like for like sales, although this was exacerbated by 
currency movements.
The sustained improvement in equity market conditions has benefited IG GroupIGG) which today reported 
'satisfactory' full year results in which a much stronger second half made up for weak first half trading. Trading 
revenues for the year dipped by just 1.4 per cent and pre-tax profit rose by 3.5 per cent to GBP192.2m. Buy.
Mobile payments specialist MonitiseMONI) reports that demand for its services is running at all time highs and this 
has translated to full year revenues of at least GBP70m, up from GBP36m last year. The Monitise platform has 23m 
users and handles $40bn worth of payments and transactions a year. We keep our buy recommendation.
Vets surgeries group CVS GroupCVSG) has posted positive like for like growth of 3.4 per cent for the year to June 
and is also benefiting on a group level from increased numbers taking up its loyalty scheme membership and 
improving e-commerce sales. We maintain our buy rating.
Simon Thompson recommendationInlandINL) announces its year end trading update which shows profitability 
running ahead of expectations. The company has made GBP11.4m from the sale of 55 homes, compared with 
GBP1.7m last year, and also sold 355 plots for GBP15.35m. Its 74 per cent owned subsidiary DGVL sold 76 plots

Find out which shares today's quality papers are tipping
Ryanair (RYA) has bold plans to increase its European market share to 20 per cent from 15 per cent and transport 
100m passengers a year by the end of the decade, The Telegraph's Questor points out. In order to meet its 
objective, the low-cost airline will buy more planes. In May it announced it was buying 175 aircraft from Boeing, 
amid claims it had managed to get such a large discount it was paying 2005 prices. The group expects the 
acquisition to increase its passenger numbers by about 7 per cent each year over the medium term. Shares in 
Ryanair are trading on a March 2014 earnings multiple of 16.1, which is line with rival easyJet, but this falls to just 
13.7 in 2014. Questor said it thinks shares in Ryanair are a 'buy' based on management's revised and ambitious 
growth targets (Last IC rating: Hold, 20 May http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/2013/05/20/shares/news-and-

Schneider Electric, of France, was revealed last week to have made an indicative bid for Invensys (ISYS) because 
of pressure from the City Takeover Panel. However, no offer is guaranteed, The Times' Tempus column said. It has 
yet to complete due diligence on Invensys and has until August 8th to make its move, which could prompt a 
response from other suitors. "Those who have been holding Invensys shares since the start of last year, when I 
recommended them, might ponder the share price graph and think that the present price offers a decent enough 
profit. Certainly, if it were my money, I would be tempted to take about half off the table and keep the rest in as a 
gamble that a counter-bidder will emerge," Tempus added. The indicative offer from Schneider assigns a sky-high

Fund manager M&G is unhappy that Gulf Keystone Petroleum (GKP) has nominated four directors for next week's 
annual meeting, fiercely opposed by the company. "Gulf Keystone could probably do with a better board," according 
to the Financial Times' Lex column, which believes there is a lot to be said for independent directors to keep 
executives in line. "Its bigger problem, though, is not too few independent directors but too many soldiers," it added. 
Gulf has proposed two non-execs of its choice, arguing that M&G's nominees lack the right experience and 
knowledge of the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, where Gulf Keystone owns a little over half of the giant Shaikan 
oil discovery. The company's other problem is the outcome of the court case taken by Excalibur Ventures, its one-
time partner in Kurdistan, which claims to have been unfairly shunted aside by Gulf Keystone. Lex believes at only

Top cycles expert Kerry Balenthiran won't be getting onboard easyJet any time soon
While the US stock market has rampaged back to its highs, the FTSE is lagging somewhat. I remain of the view that 
a key turning-point was reached in May and that the correction has further to go. I admit that I cannot see a ready 
trigger for the next burst of selling. However, I am keeping a close eye both upon bond yields and oil prices. Both 
these markets are anticipating that the US Federal Reserve will not cut back on its money-printing spree too hard. 
The Fed - like central banks elsewhere - wants to keep rates lower than inflation. This may be tricky to maintain.
This brings me to easyJet (EZJ) and to how I use my views on market cycles when making individual share 
purchase decisions. EZJ is one of Europe's largest airlines and its website proclaims that its "combination of 
convenient airports and wide range of destinations means [it] has broad appeal across different geographies and 
customer types". In my opinion, it has set itself apart well by being a low-cost airline as opposed to a no-frills airline. 
Whereas I wouldn't dream of flying with Ryanair, I have flown with EZJ and found that it gave me the perfect 
combination of price, convenience and comfort. I won't pay extra to fly with BA within Europe, just to get a free drink 
and a "meal." (Last time, I got a packet of crisps last time - what happened to sandwiches?!).
I'm not the only one who feels this way judging by the impressive revenue growth and earnings per share (EPS) 
growth over the last five years. Its revenue in 2012 was up 11.6 per cent up on 2011 and EPS growth was 19 per 
cent for the same period. Trading on a forward price earnings ratio of 15.8 times, the shares are not cheap, but EPS 
is forecast to grow 37 per cent in 2013 and the forecast dividend yield is 2.1 per cent. The business model is 
working well, as easyJet is taking market share from national carriers, while it is aiming to grow its position in key 
business routes.
What troubles me, however, is the single biggest cost to any airline - fuel. Fuel makes up 32.5 per cent of EZJ's 
2012 costs and eats up 29.9 per cent of revenue. Net profit margin is pretty slim at 8.2 per cent of sales. In addition, 
foreign exchange movements are another risk, 47 per cent of revenue is in sterling, and 43 per cent in Euros, 
whereas 35 per cent of costs are in US Dollars.
To manage these risks, management state that EZJ hedges forward between 65 and 85 per cent of the next 12 
months' anticipated fuel and currency requirements and between 45 and 65 per cent of the following 12 months' 
anticipated requirements.
Buy easyJet flights, not its shares
So any volatility in the price of fuels, either driven by or combined with adverse exchange rate movements, could 
seriously impact analysts' earnings forecasts. Whilst I believe that easyJet has a great product and is well run, there 
are two big cost-drivers that are inherently volatile that investors appear to have become complacent about whilst 
driving the share price up to new highs. As I believe the commodity bull market cycle won't peak until 2015, I think 
the share price is very vulnerable to any unexpected events that cause the oil price to spike higher.
Of course, the opposite could happen, but investing is all about making decisions based on things you know and 
your beliefs about future prospects, in order to get the balance between risk and reward. Therefore whilst I am 
happy to fly EZJ, I won't be buying them for the ValuableGrowth portfolio.

Equities are sickly after Ben Bernanke indicated the end of the Fed's medicine
Equities have fallen sharply in early trading after the confirmation from the Federal Reserve last night that it expects 
to begin tapering its QE3 bond buying programme later this year. The Trader Dominic Picarda stayed on the 
sidelines in recent days and is going to continue to do so while this correction plays out.
IC TIP UPDATES:
Gulf Keystone Petroleum'sGKP) full year results contain little new detail with the company posting a loss of $81.8m 
as it continues with exploration and development of its assets in Kurdistan. Field development at Shaikan is 
expected to ramp up in the second half of this year. Shares in the company are currently treading water ahead of an 
expected decision on Excalibur Ventures' claims against Gulf Keystone. Meanwhile the M&G Recovery fund has 
put forward the names of four directors it wishes to see considered for election to the board including former 
director and significant shareholder Jeremy Asher. We keep our buy recommendation.
Indian film company Eros InternationalEROS) has posted a 4.3 per cent rise in revenues in the year to March and a 
6.1 per cent rise in earnings. The company has recently sealed a deal with HBO for two new channels in India 
which management describe as a 'game changer'. We keep our buy rating.

worth GBP12.2m in total. Buy.
New Britain Palm OilNBPO) has attracted an offer for 20 per cent of its shares at 550p a share from Malaysian palm

Housebuilder Crest Nicholson (CRST) has been reaping strong benefits from the government's 'Help to buy' 
scheme programme. In fact, analyst Robin Hardy at broker Peel Hunt believes around 30 per cent of sales are now 
being generated through that channel. This segment enjoys a "strong pricing advantage over more traditional 
sales". So, following a relatively cautious market outlook in the pre-close trading statement, expect to see quite a 
sizeable step up in the confidence of the message regarding the state of the market when the company releases 
half-year results this week.
Peel Hunt is forecasting Crest to report pre-tax profits of GBP28m, up from GBP16m in 2012, for the six months to 
the end of April and operating profit margins around 1.5 percentage points higher than a year ago. For the 12 
months to the end of October 2013, the broker expects pre-tax profits to rise from GBP62.3m to GBP80.4m to 
produce underlying EPS of 24.7p. Having risen by over 50 per cent from the IPO price of 220p in mid-February this 
year, the shares now trade on 13.5 times forward earnings, in line with the rest of the sector.

As anyone trying to buy a home in London will be aware, the capital's housing market remains buoyant with strong 
price inflation seen across all market segments. The company most exposed to this benign trading environment is 
FTSE 250-listed Berkeley Group (BKG), which has more than 40 active sites in London. Profits are lumpy and 
Berkeley now only guides to profit levels across a three-year period from 2013-15. This guidance has been rising 
from initially GBP750m, then to GBP900m, and this could easily rise above GBP1bn when the company reports full-
year results for the 12 months to the end of April 2013.
The shares have done very well since we advised buying in mid-December, posting a 29 per cent gain in the six-
month period. This is partly down to the fact that the board has promised to pay out a 1,300p a share dividend by 
September 2021 (most of it from 2015 onwards). Analysts calculate that assuming 2015 EPS of around 225-250p, 
up from around 144p expected in the 12 months to the end of April 2013, and adjust for a 500p a share of dividends 
embedded in the share price, the prospective 2015 PE ratio is only six. This rating compares favourably with rivals.

Budget airlines such as Ryanair can offer sustainable earnings growth and an attractive dividend despite low 
economic growth and scarcity of yield
Barry Norris, manager of the IM Argonaut European Alpha Fund (GB00B4ZRCD05), believes that budget airline 
Ryanair is one of the best investment opportunities around. In its recent annual results, the airline reported a 13 per 
cent rise in both profits and revenues, while earnings per share increased 16 per cent to 0.39.
"People have a jaundiced view of investing in airlines," said Mr Norris. "Yet Ryanair has again shown the strength of 
its operating model and that accelerated growth prospects need not necessarily come at the expense of future 
dividends. The shares offer sustainable earnings growth and attractive dividend income in an environment of low 
economic growth and scarcity of investment yield. Ryanair's combination of growth and yield is the new holy grail in 
stock market investment, and shares like Ryanair are uncommonly attractive. Low-cost airlines currently represent 
one of the best investment opportunities around.
"It is often assumed that companies face a two-way choice between investing in their business for growth by 
increasing capital expenditure, or paying out profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. But this is not the case 
for companies with a high return on equity, or is more specifically a false choice for companies that have a return on 
equity in excess of their growth rate.
"Ryanair is a great example of the way in which a company with a superior business model can generate consistent 
compound earnings growth for investors in a difficult industry environment, with its superior unleveraged return on 
equity of 17 per cent being crucial to the success of its model."
Mr Norris has held Ryanair since 2010 and it accounts for around 5.5 per cent of IM Argonaut European Alpha 
Fund's assets. Ryanair is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and currently trades at around 6.75 a share.

RESULTS: Ryanair's share price gains altitude as predictions for a solid summer season are borne out
Shares in Irish budget airline Ryanair (RYA) cruised up to an all-time high on full-year figures that revealed a solid 
underlying increase in passenger traffic and an upward trend for average fare prices. The carrier's predilection for 
charging for anything either not nailed down, or larger than a small attache case, helped boost operating profits by 
16 per cent to 718m (GBP606m), despite higher fuel and staff costs.
Ryanair's fuel bill rose by 18 per cent during the year to 1.88bn, partly because of firmer oil prices, but also because 
of higher levels of activity. Indeed, having been seriously caught out by rising prices in the past, management has 
taken few chances with its fuel hedging policy. Ryanair now has 90 per cent of its fuel needs hedged out through 
2014 at $980 a tonne (or $98 a barrel), while 25 per cent of 2015's requirement is already hedged at $93 a barrel.
The 11 per cent increase in passenger revenues to 3.82bn comprised a 6 per cent fare rise and a 5 per cent 
increase in passenger numbers, with an average load factor per plane of 82 per cent. Management forecasts that 
passenger numbers will rise by 3 per cent in the current financial year to 81.5m.
Investec estimates are under review pending possible upgrades but, prior to these results, the broker forecasts 
adjusted EPS of 42.4A, up from 39.5A in 2013.

BG GroupBG.) has warned that its production is likely to dip this year due to shutdowns of existing fields, ongoing 
maintenance and slower than expected ramp up from new fields. Total production in 2012 was 658,000 barrels of

Like any integrated major, Royal Dutch Shell(RDSB) has many moving parts; a point that will be aptly demonstrated 
within its 2012 full-year results. No single operational issue will dominate, but it will be interesting to note whether 
the welcome improvement in third quarter refining margins has been maintained. Indeed, refining margins in the US 
have improved partly as a result of the reversal of the historic WTI premium over Brent crude, but this dynamic has 
also been weighing on margins for Shell's upstream business in North America.
Shell's net capital investment for the year should amount to approximately $30bn (GBP18.5bn), but the 2012 results 
won't include substantive benefits of the group's huge aggregate capital outlay of recent years. Indeed, Shell 
reported that its third-quarter production had increased by just one per cent, even after discounting the effects of 
last year's production shut-ins at its Nigerian facilities, so shareholders won't be expecting an upsurge in output just 
yet. More attention will centre on the monetisation timetable for a number of the group's big-ticket capital projects, 
such as the $40bn Browse LNG project in Western Australia.

RESULTS: Ryanair is flying record numbers and successfully raising fares, so should have enough spare cash for 
more dividends
Ryanair had such a strong summer it has revised up forecasts for full-year profit by 20 per cent. It flew a record 48m 
passengers during the first half, an increase of 7 per cent, raised the average fare by 6 per cent and spent less than 
expected on fuel, too. Investors took that as a sign to jump aboard.
Profit after tax grew 10 per cent to 596m (GBP477m) despite the recession, fierce competition, higher airport 
charges and fuel bill of over 1.1bn. The introduction of reserved seating helped - sales of ancillary products leapt by 
a fifth to 583.8m. True, the traditionally quiet winter months limit visibility, but traffic is expected to increase by 4 per 
cent this year to over 79m passengers and net income to somewhere between 490m and 520m. That gives Ryanair 
about 12 per cent of Europe's short-haul market, but chief executive Michael O'Leary wants 18 per cent, or 120m 
passengers, within 10 years.
The target may look ambitious, but its costs per passenger are much lower than others, while rivals are going bust 
and legacy carriers such as IAG are cutting short-haul operations. A 'radical' package of remedies should increase 
Ryanair's chances of getting EU competition approval for its Aer Lingus bid, too, and record cash reserves of 3.9bn 
make more special dividends likely - a 0.34 a share one-off will be paid at the end of this month.
Broker Investec Securities expects adjusted pre-tax profit of 563.4m for the full year, giving adjusted EPS of 34.7A 
(from 557.3m and 33.4A in 2012).

Week Ahead 5-9 November
Investors could be underwhelmed by half-year figures from high street retail bellwether Marks & Spencer (MKS), 
due on 6 November. After all, first-quarter like-for-like sales fell 2.8 per cent on the same period a year earlier, with 
underlying general merchandising sales having tumbled by a painful 6.8 per cent. Management blamed tough 
market conditions and unseasonably wet weather, as well as ongoing stock shortages in key womenswear items. 
With the Olympics having helped keep shoppers away from the high street since that dreary update appeared, don't 
hold your breath for a dramatic improvement in the second quarter, either. Indeed, analysts at JP Morgan 
Cazenove admit that Marks' second quarter trading is "unlikely to be brilliant" - with better trading more likely to 
make an appearance during 2013. Yet the shares have climbed 25 per cent since those grim first-quarter numbers 
and, at 391p, now trade on 12 times the broker's 32.7p earnings estimate for end-March 2013 (2012: 33.76p). 
Amidst ongoing consumer gloom, further upside looks unlikely.
In contrast, investors can expect rather better news from Associated British Foods (ABF) when it reports full-year 
figures - also on 6 November. Management said in a trading update in September that underlying sales at discount 
clothing retailer Primark are set to rise 15 per cent year-on-year, while profits from the sugar business should be 
"considerably higher". And while restructuring costs will hit the grocery operation's earnings, revenues there should 
be well up on last year. The agriculture business has been benefiting from higher volumes of sugar beet feed as 
well, although the group's ingredients unit will see profits well down - reflecting restructuring charges. Overall, 
management say that adjusted operating profit should be "substantially ahead of last year" and JP Morgan 
Cazenove expects pre-tax profit of GBP971m with EPS 86.1p (2011: GBP835m/74p). The shares have jumped 18 
per cent since early June and, at 1,375p, now trade on 16 times expected earnings - possibly leaving its progress 
looking priced-in.

Luxury goods group Burberry (BRBY) will report half-year figures on 7 November - that announcement should hold 
few surprises after having already revealed rapidly slowing growth with its half-year trading update in October. 
Specifically, retail revenues grew 10 per cent in the first half - well down from the 45 per cent growth seen a year 
earlier. While licensing revenue actually fell 5 per cent, compared with 4 per cent growth a year ago. That's 
consistent with the slide in growth recently reported by rival luxury goods player, Mulberry. Worryingly, a key reason 
for its weaker performance was "a more challenging environment in Asia" - previously a growth engine for all luxury 
goods players. JP Morgan Cazenove expects EPS of 66.26p from Burberry for the year to end-March - up just 7 per 
cent on 2012's figure and a far cry from the 26 per cent earnings growth seem in the year to end-March 2011. True, 
the shares have fallen off a cliff since fears about growth emerged in early September, but at 1,135p, they still trade 
on a hardly cheap 17 times expected earnings.

Body
Over the last year airlines have produced the best-performing stock in the FTSE 350 Travel & Leisure sector - a 
sector which itself has substantially outperformed the main index, rising 25 per cent compared with 12 per cent.
Airlines have a reputation for losing investors cash, yet the returns can be handsome for shrewd stock-pickers. 
Indeed, easyJet's shares are up 80 per cent over the last year, making them the best-performer from the FTSE 350 
Travel & Leisure sector, while Ryanair's shares have gained almost a third over the same period. However, risks 
are high, so we're aiming to sort the shares that are going to soar from those heading for a crash landing.
It's easy to understand why sentiment towards airlines is often so poor. Planes cost millions, fuel is extortionate, 
competition is fierce and the industry is vulnerable to macro events, too. And there's little happening now to 
discourage the notion that airlines are money pits. High fuel prices, hefty airport taxes and low growth are taking 
their toll and carriers are stuck in a fight for survival. More will inevitably go bust and others face being shackled by 
painful restructuring efforts.
Growth in passenger demand fell to just 3.4 per cent in July from 6.3 per cent the previous month, according to 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the industry body's director general and chief executive Tony 
Tyler warns airlines to expect a "tough" second half.
But it's not all bad news. Demand for international flights to more prosperous far-flung destinations meant European 
carriers still grew a respectable 4.8 per cent. Numbers from UK budget carriers have been impressive, too. Indeed, 
easyJet flew 6 per cent more passengers last month than at the same time last year, and Ryanair had a record 
month following a 9 per cent increase in August. Even BA and Iberia owner International Consolidated Airlines 
(IAG) managed 5 per cent.
Given that more passengers are flying, you may ask why sentiment towards the sector is not more positive? Well, 
costs for one thing. A fall in the price of jet fuel during the spring was short-lived and carriers are paying nearly 
$1,100 per metric tonne again, about 25 per cent more than they were paying in June. IATA had already predicted 
the global airline industry's fuel bill would increase by $31bn (GBP19.4bn) this year to an eye-watering $207bn. 
That's nearly five times as much as in 2003 and means around one-third of an airline's operating expenses are fuel 
compared with 14 per cent nine years ago. And with passenger growth unable to compensate, industry net profits 
are tipped to plunge from $7.9bn to just $3bn in 2012.
High-flying investments
"The eurozone crisis is standing in the way of improved profitability and we continue to face the prospect of a net 
profit margin of just 0.5 per cent," said Mr Tyler. It's worth bearing in mind that this forecast was made before the 
latest spike in fuel. The outlook is grim.
A
Efficiency is key
But as share price performances tell, nimble low-cost carriers, such as easyJet and Ryanair, have been far more 
successful than network airlines, such as Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and IAG's Iberia. That's largely down to these 
companies restructuring early and getting a grip on capacity by grounding planes in quiet winter months and 
diverting others to more profitable routes. Margins are improving and they don't have the structural issues that 
hamper rivals.
Indeed, easyJet is so efficient it has been able to increase forecasts twice this year. Costs have risen less than 
feared and a wet start to the summer meant business was brisk during the third quarter. Still, life is hard - the weak 
euro is unhelpful, easyJet will spend over GBP1bn on fuel this year, and it's unclear whether it has the leg-room to 
increase fares much more.
Ryanair certainly doubts whether higher fares can cover extra costs this year. It understands why consolidation is 
important and inevitable too. Fewer competing carriers mean less seats, higher fares and bigger profits for the 
survivors - owner Michael O'Leary reckons only Air France, British Airways (BA), easyJet, Lufthansa and Ryanair 
will be left standing.
Mr O'Leary was quick to exploit the demise of Hungary's Malev and Spanair, and it's the same thinking that's 
behind his latest attempt to buy Irish rival Aer Lingus, which Ryanair already owns a 30 per stake stake in. The deal 
is currently with the European Commission and Ryanair reckons a dramatic package of concessions could get it 
past the regulator. It may be third time lucky for the loudmouth Irishman. If not, Gulf carrier Etihad, keen to drive 
traffic through its Abu Dhabi hub, looks a likely buyer.
A
Cashing in on consolidation
Now, more than ever, it's critical that airlines establish alliances and code sharing agreements over flight schedules 
and other services. Indeed, Etihad has already struck 36 code-shares and taken a 29 per cent stake in Air Berlin, 
providing the German carrier with much-needed financing in the process. Other struggling carriers are looking 
towards the Middle East, with Quantus ditching a 17-year tie-up with IAG and agreeing a new 10-year alliance with 
Emirates, the Gulf's largest operator, which provides much better connections to the rest of Europe And there's far 
more logic to having a hub in the middle, rather than at the end of a long-haul route.
The huge restrictions on ownership of foreign airlines have made alliances more popular than mergers and 
acquisitions in the sector. Indeed, BA's tie-up with American Airlines on transatlantic routes is about as close to a 
merger as you can get without running into regulatory problems. Given the importance of US connections to BA, it's 
easy to see why IAG, its owner, is also mulling taking a stake in the bankrupt US operator, although it may not have 
to if a merger goes ahead between American and US Airways which would be supportive of the BA/American 
relationship.
That's the best possible outcome for IAG, which recently bought BMI for its Heathrow slots. Its balance sheet 
strength looks limited, especially as the carrier will be cash flow negative for the next few years. And there's a 
pressing need for it to address issues at Iberia. "Up to now it's been a disaster," said one analyst, slamming the 
acquisition of the Spanish airline as "structurally flawed" and citing the threat of low-cost carriers, an imploding 
Spanish economy and possible rivalry from Latin America.
High-flying investments
It's the same for European peers. True, reining in capacity provides some downside protection but, like Iberia, that 
alone is not enough for Lufthansa, Air France-KLM. "While clearly there is potential for operating leverage, fuel is a 
headwind and the restructuring programmes are still in their early stages with labour posing obstacles to reforms," 
reckons Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Irish broker Davy.
IC VIEW
We've suspected for some time that increasingly price conscious consumers would favour low-cost carriers over the 
network airlines, and they have. That said, we didn't expect easyJet's share price to leap 80 per cent in a year. In 
the short term, there looks to be little opportunity for the pre-occupied legacy carriers. With easyJet trading on 
multiples in line with its three-year average, it's hard to see much upside there, either. Yes, airlines are highly 
geared to economic recovery, and rapid growth will come, just not yet.
<xmltable>
| |FAVOURITES:
|We're excited about FastJet, set up by easyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou and run by former Go chief Ed Winter. 
Establishing sub-Saharan Africa's first low-cost airline is high risk, but the potential is massive. There's already a 
legacy operation and the first of a liveried fleet of Airbus's will hit the skies above East Africa in November. 
Forecasts for cash profits of $125m in three years make this $100m company worth watching. Shifting down the 
glamour stakes slightly, Dart Group runs a fleet of Jet2.com planes out of Yorkshire and has a profitable package 
holiday business, too. It's "cautious about profit growth", but will hit full-year targets and, trading on less than six 
times forecast earnings, the shares are cheap.|
</xmltable>
<xmltable>
| |OUTSIDERS:
|We advised selling IAG late last year and, with the shares at 146p, we see no reason to change our view. In time, 
the acquisition of Iberia will pay off, but Mr Walsh has just warned that IAG will make a "small operating loss" this 
year, and it's doubtful the Spanish operation will break even before 2014. Indeed, Iberia's short-haul business could 
lose over 400m this year and that group target of 1.6bn profit in 2015 looks increasingly ambitious. Splashing out on 
new long-haul jets will increase debt, too. A weak euro and fuel is making life tough for UK-based carriers, although 
managing capacity and ancillary revenues like easyJet's allocated seating should help offset some of the extra 
headwinds. Still, we think that's priced in. |

Our roundup of the big stories of the last week
Big Apple
Apple hits valuation milestone
Technology giant Apple became the most valuable company of all time, as its market capitalisation topped the 
$620.6bn valuation Microsoft achieved at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. The milestone came despite 
poor second-quarter sales figures last month, with investors apparently betting that the imminent launch of new 
versions of its iconic gadgets next month could bring another sales bonanza. The shares have climbed nearly 75 
per cent since we suggested buying them at $376 last October and, on a forecast PE ratio of 15, they still don't look 
particularly expensive.
Nadir nabbed
Polly Peck boss guilty
Shareholders who lost money with the collapse of Polly Peck will finally see justice, after its former boss Asil Nadir 
was found guilty on 10 counts of theft from the conglomerate. Mr Nadir is being charged with theft totalling 
GBP34m, but is said to have stolen as much as GBP146m from Polly Peck, which at its peak was a member of the 
FTSE 100 worth over GBP2bn, with interests in textiles, electronics and fruit. It collapsed under a GBP1.3bn debt 
mountain in 1990.
Deficit dilemma
Borrowing figures worse than expected
The UK's public finances took another unexpected turn for the worse last month, with the government borrowing 
GBP0.6bn in July against forecasts of a GBP2.2bn surplus. The shortfall was the result of plunging corporation tax 
receipts, which were GBP1.7bn lower than last year and included a GBP1bn drop in receipts from the oil and gas 
industry. The poor figures prompted further calls from business leaders for chancellor George Osborne to introduce 
measures to boost economic growth alongside deficit reduction.
24 August
Up in the air
Stansted Airport up for sale
Another chapter closed on the long-running saga surrounding the future of Britain's airports, as the owners of BAA 
caved into the competition regulator's demands that it must dispose of Stansted Airport, which analysts expect will 
fetch in excess of GBP1bn. Bidders are likely to include established airport groups, but airline Ryanair also 
reaffirmed its interest in taking a stake, arguing that it's the only London airport with room for expansion. If it's 
successful, it would mark the airline's first foray into airport infrastructure.
Losing Facebook
Director defriends social media giant
Shares in social media giant Facebook took another tumble after the expiry of lock-ups saw a key board member 
dump stock. Director Peter Thiel sold another $396m-worth of shares, taking the veteran tech investor's disposals 
to $1bn since its controversial flotation. Facebook's shares have halved since coming to market in May, prompting 
hedge fund manager George Soros to take an $11m punt. Mr Soros also snapped up a $40m stake in Manchester 
United, which like Facebook has seen its shares come under pressure since it floated in New York last month.
Mining misery
Tough week for mining industry
Miners dominated the financial headlines this week, in particular the mounting problems at Lonmin. As well as the 
tragic human consequences, the hit to production means debt covenants are likely to be breached, which could see 
the beleaguered platinum miner seek new funding. Elsewhere, the proposed merger between Glencore and Xstrata 
faces collapse due to continued opposition from Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, which owns 12 per cent of Xstrata, 
while BHP Billiton shelved a $20m expansion plan for its Australian Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine, 
blaming the slowdown in China.

puts-olympic-dam-on-ice-URueyMocFn6dxm0A7nEc uO/article.html BHP puts Olympic Dam on ice
Banking bust-up
Now RBS faces sanctions probe
RBS became the latest bank to face scrutiny from US authorities over claims that it had violated sanctions with Iran, 
and could face a hefty fine after Standard Chartered agreed a $340m settlement for similar infringements last week. 
The investigation by the Federal Reserve and US Justice Department was initiated after RBS volunteered 
information following an 18-month internal review. RBS was also fined $500m in 2010 after subsidiary ABN Amro 
was found to have violated US sanctions, and remains under investigation in the ongoing Libor probe.

easyJet's shares have been climbing sharply and third-quarter results reveal why
What's new:
- Profit forecast upgraded
- Third-quarter revenue up 10.5 per cent
- Lower-than-expected costs
Budget airline easyJet keeps surprising itself. In March, investors were told to expect smaller half-year losses, and 
now a decent third quarter and a drop in the price of jet fuel means the full-year results should be better than 
expected, too.
Assuming there's no significant disruption, easyJet now expects pre-tax profit of GBP280m-GBP300m in the 12 
months to September, compared with the previous consensus of GBP272m. The airline flew 16m passengers 
during the three months to end June, up almost 11 per cent on the previous year, generating over GBP1bn of 
revenue - almost GBP100m more than last year. Flying rain-soaked Brits to the sun and running extra flights on 
more profitable routes in France, Switzerland and Italy also helped, nudging underlying revenue per seat up 5 per 
cent to GBP57.58. However, the weak euro cut reported growth to just 2.8 per cent and non-seat revenue fell, 
meaning easyJet actually made slightly less per passenger and expects about the same in the fourth quarter.
Still, costs rose only 1 per cent at constant currency - less than feared - and renegotiating more than a third of its 
ground handling contracts should help save GBP90m this financial year, so, after adding in exchange rate moves 
and stripping out fuel, costs were actually lower.
A
Liberum Capital says -
Hold. Volumes remain strong, but underlying fares appear to be struggling - we estimate that on a constant 
currency basis average fares fell 0.3 per cent. Demand seems very price sensitive and winter 2012 is uncertain. We 
have increased our full-year pre-tax profit estimate by GBP20m to GBP300m, reflecting better-than-expected cost 
easyJet up in the clouds
control and a reduced tax charge raises our EPS forecast 13 per cent to 57.2p. However, the valuation is quite full - 
easyJet shares trade on 9.6 times forward earnings and a much smaller discount to fair value than Ryanair - and, 
with limited upside to our 562p target price, we move from buy to hold.
A
Espirito Santo says -
Buy. We have increased our EPS forecasts by 11 per cent for the current financial year, 10 per cent for 2013 and 
13 per cent the year after following an encouraging update. We view easyJet as a long-term winner in the European 
airline industry. In the short term, we see the shares supported by clear positive earnings momentum, with good 
visibility on forward bookings for the rest of the financial year. In the longer term, there is scope for structural unit 
revenue improvements from attracting more business travellers. easyJet's valuation is attractive in absolute terms 
and relative to European peers, so fair value for the shares is now 10 per cent higher at 660p.
easyJet looks to have a grip on costs it can control, and raising profit guidance is becoming a habit. Still, the shares 
have soared this past year and reflect a lot of good news. True, they trade on less than 10 times forecast earnings, 
but that's in line with its three-year average, and the fuel bill will still top GBP1bn this year. The airline also has to 
contend with high airport costs, taxes and weak economic growth, too. At 546p, they rate a hold.

Business press headlines:
Ryanair has launched its third bid for rival airline Aer Lingus in six years, despite previous attempts having been 
blocked on competition grounds. The low-cost carrier made a shock announcement after the stock markets closed 
that it is offering 1.30 per Aer Lingus share in an all cash bid, which values the Irish flag carrier at about 694m 
(GBP560m). The offer represents a 38.3 per cent premium to Aer Lingus's closing price on Tuesday of 94 cents. 
Burberry , Hammerson , Imagination Technologies
Ryanair already owns a 29.82 per cent stake in Aer Lingus which was built up during two previous unsuccessful 
attempts to buy the carrier in 2006 and 2008. That holding is currently the subject of an investigation by the UK's 
Competition Commission, The Telegraph reports.
Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan, defended the bank's decision to locate in Britain large parts of the 
business that made a shock $2bn (GBP1.3bn) as US politicians attacked its exploitation of the "London loophole". 
Giving evidence to US lawmakers yesterday [Tuesday], Mr Dimon said JP Morgan's CIO [Chief Investment Office] 
operation "could have been in London or somewhere else" as he defended the bank's British operations. "I don't 
think this activity was in London because the regulatory regime was less," said Mr Dimon. New York congressman 
Gregory Meeks, said he "kept hearing about a London loophole" and said many bankers he had spoken to had 
threatened to move business from the US to Britain because the regulatory regime was seen as more favourable, 
according to The Telegraph.
Greece's pro-European parties were in the "final stretch" of forming a coalition on Tuesday night, as EU and IMF 
officials were poised to visit Athens for talks on resuming payment of the country's bail-out funding. With world 
leaders urging action to calm nerves about Greece's continuation in the euro, the conservative New Democracy, 
which narrowly won Sunday's re-run election, is seeking an alliance with the socialists of Pasok and with 
Democratic Left. A Democratic Left's source said the party had sought unspecified guarantees about public sector 
salaries and pensions, which have been cut in under the terms of Greece's second bail-out of 130bn, The 
Telegraph says.
It is one of the most perplexing features of Britain's recent economic performance: why is productivity so weak? 
Bank of England research to be published today sheds fresh light on the topic - and the conclusions are less than 
encouraging. Since the banking crash, the UK has underperformed not only its big trading partners but also when 
compared with 13 previous historical episodes, according to an article in the Quarterly Bulletin. Only Norway has 
suffered weaker productivity growth since the crisis. Spanish productivity, on the other hand, has taken off - albeit 
because its companies have been so aggressive in shedding workers. A country's ability to lift standards of living 
relies heavily on its capacity to generate more output per worker. Britain's weak performance, therefore, has been a 
cause for alarm since the banking crash of 2007-08, The Times reports.
There were potentially suspicious share price movements before one in five takeover deals or big company 
announcements last year, the Financial Services Authority said yesterday in its annual report. The regulator 
detected abnormal price movements during the two days before 19.8 per cent of formal company statements to the 
stock market, a figure that suggests insider dealing could remain rife in the City. The FSA is pursuing a concerted 
crackdown on market abuse - when directors, brokers or other share traders benefit from the receipt of inside 
information in advance. Although the level of potentially questionable trades is down on last year's 21.2 per cent 
and is the lowest since 2003, it still attracted criticism for being unacceptably high, according to The Times.
The landmark sale of a 318-branch business carved out from Royal Bank of Scotland's existing network to Grupo 
Santander of Spain has been hit by fresh delays, The Times has learnt. The latest problems mean that the 
GBP1.65bn deal, announced in August 2010 and at first intended to be completed at the end of 2011 and then by 
the end of this year, will not be cemented much before June 2013. RBS is struggling to prepare the business into an 
"oven-ready" form acceptable to Santander and to the Financial Services Authority, which is anxious that there 
should be no disruption to customers. One person familiar with negotiations said that it was proving incredibly 
complex "to unpick an organisation hardwired into the larger RBS-NatWest group".
David Cameron was embroiled in a diplomatic bust-up with the President of Argentina about the Falklands 
yesterday as he refused to accept an envelope thrust at him by Cristina FernAndez de Kirchner. Prime Minister 
believed that Mrs Kirchner was pulling a stunt and walked away from their confrontation after stressing repeatedly 
that the Falkland islanders had a right to self-determination. The details of their diplomatic spat emerged from 
British officials who said the envelope wielded by Mrs Kirchner was A4 size and "stuffed full" of documents. It bore 
the word "Malvinas" on the outside, The Times reports.

The private equity arm of French insurance group Axa has raised $8bn (GBP5.1bn) from investors - - more than 
double the amount it was originally seeking - as it looks to buy assets from banks that are shoring up their capital 
reserves. New rules, known as Basel III, make it more expensive for banks to hold risky assets, and they need to 
free up capital to support their core lending and investment banking businesses. Axa Private Equity had initially 
been looking to raise $3.5bn for its secondary fund of funds, but ended up raising $7.1bn. An additional $900m will 
go towards its primary fund of funds, the group said. Demand came from investors in Asia, the Middle East and 
North America, it said, The Scotsman says.

Markets appear to be holding their breath until Ben Bernanke speaks
Equities are steady after yesterday's surge on the hope for further monetary stimulus, with eyes now focused on the 
US Federal Reserve, whose latest meeting closes this evening. The Trader Dominic Picarda doesn't expect 
fireworks from the Fed tonight but is still looking to go long on the FTSE100.
IC TIP UPDATES:
Cluff Gold (CLF) is popular with investors this morning after announcing positive drilling results from its Yaoure gold 
project in Core d'Ivoire which has prompted it to ramp up assay drilling. We remain buyers.
Braemar Shipping (BMS) shares have dipped today after the company announced the departure of its chief 
executive Alan Marsh, who is being replaced by finance director James Kidwell. A trading update also indicates 
continued mixed fortunes in the shipping world, we retain our sell recommendation.
Sub-saharan agricultural play Zambeef's (ZAM) interim results show good progress with revenues up 32 per cent 
and pre-tax profits 53 per cent better. But the company continues to be overshadowed by a tax dispute with the 
Zambian authorities, who want $10.7m for back taxes. This is being appealed and, when resolved, should lift a 
cloud, which is why we are keeping the shares on a buy.
Indian renewables specialist and long term buy recommendation Greenko (GKO) is close to completing its first wind 
project, which will take its portfolio capacity to 260MW from July. It has another 500MW of wind and hydro assets 
under construction.
KEY STORIES:
Aer Lingus (AERL) shares are flying this morning after rival Ryanair (RYA) made its third takeover attempt in six 
years late last night. The 1.30 a share offer values Aer Lingus at just shy of 700m.
Sirius Minerals (SXX) has made a significant managerial appointment as it looks to push forward development of its 
potentially huge potash project in North Yorkshire. The new managing director of York Potash, Alan Watling, has 30 
Cluff Gold, Braemar Shipping, Sirius Minerals, Aer Lingus , Healthcare Locums & more
years experience in the mining industry, latterly as chief executive of African Minerals (AMI) where he oversaw 
development of the Tonkolili iron ore mine in just 16 months.
Kesa Electricals (KESA) has issued predictably dire full year results in the face of a tough consumer spending 
environment in both the UK and Europe. Revenues dipped by 2 per cent and retail profits fell from 117m to 70m. 
Investors were also disappointed to hear that the dividend is being 'rebased', or halved in plain speaking.
OTHER STORIES:
Healthcare Locums (HLO) investors have been through the mill in recent years so it is little surprise that today's 
chink of light, in the form of news that US investors are dropping lawsuits against the company and its previous 
management, sent its shares almost 20 per cent higher.

RESULTS: These were Ryanair's best ever numbers, but don't expect a repeat this year.
Jet fuel cost a king's ransom and Europe spent much of last year struggling to avoid recession. Yet Ryanair still 
made more money than ever through a combination of higher fares and extra charges. Unfortunately, the budget 
airline will not repeat the trick and warns net profit could be down as much as 20 per cent this year, suggesting a 
bumpy ride ahead.
Almost 76m passengers paid an average 16 per cent extra for their seat in the financial year to March, generating 
19 per cent more underlying revenue and boosting net profit by a quarter at 503m (GBP406.06m). However, 
Ryanair spent almost 1.6bn on fuel and another 320m will be needed this year. Given that fare increases won't 
cover the shortfall, the airline expects profits will drop to between 400m and 440m. Management's caution is 
understandable. Traffic may be tipped to grow again, but the carrier has "zero yield visibility" for next winter and 
fares remain low at its new base in Budapest and on extra routes from East Midlands and Barcelona. That said, 
rivals are failing at a rapid rate and help will come from slower capacity growth and further fare increases too. 
What's more, enviable cash generation means shareholders are in line for a 34A a share special dividend in 
November.
Broker Liberum Capital expects a drop in adjusted EPS from 34.1A to 33.4A in 2013.

21 May: markets are calmer, but it probably won't last. Plus key company announcements and tip updates
Markets have started the week in rather a calm mood after the frantic sell off of last week. But will it last? See what 
The Trader Dominic Picarda thinks.
IC TIP UPDATES:
Bwin.Party Digital (BPTY) may have a silly name, but its managers are probably wise to pay two years of back-
taxes and penalties at a cost of 33m. The reason? Spain is about to issue e-gaming licences. We agree this is a 
sensible trade-off - regulated businesses being much easier to value - and think the shares remain a buy too.
Outsourcing specialist Mitie (MTO) has announced solid annual results which illustrate the ongoing resilience of the 
sector. Indeed Mitie has already booked 83 per cent of its 2012/13 budgeted revenues, which gives us confidence 
in our buy recommendation.
Property specialist Segro (SGRO) has been busy reshaping its portfolio and the sale of a further four industrial 
properties announced this morning continues this progress. The GBP205m sale takes total sales to GBP377m this 
year and sees Segro exit its offices in Birmingham and Manchester as focus returns to London and its environs. 
Segro's shares are flat on our tip but yield a healthy 6.5 per cent.
KEY STORIES:
Pursuit Dynamics (PDX) shares have crashed 77 per cent after the company said Proctor & Gamble is not taking 
up its technology. PDX has long been a marmite stock and this latest setback could be the last investors are willing 
to bear.
Sportingbet (SBT) has been caught up in the same Spanish tax situation that Bwin. But in Sportingbet's case it has 
not yet confirmed the possible hit, and that uncertainty has sent its shares 7 per cent lower.
Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair (RYA) has this morning announced record full year results with profits 25 per cent 
higher at 502.6m.
Bwin.Party, Mitie, Segro, Pursuit Dynamics, Sportingbet and more
Man Group's (EMG) has acquired fund of hedge funds business FRM, bringing in another $8bn in funds under 
management. The deal has given Man's shares - one of the FTSE's worst performers - a 7 per cent lift.
Food supplier Cranswick (CWK) appears to be back on track after a tough first half. Pre-tax profits were up by 3 per 
cent over the full year, although this was boosted by a one-off cash gain.
OTHER COMPANY NEWS:
AG Barr (BAG) has battled through the terrible wet weather of late to record an impressively resilient trading 
performance. Total revenues in the 14 weeks to 5 May were 4.3 per cent ahead of last year.

Tempus's advice on biotech firm Vernalis is more cautious. The firm takes generic compounds which it does not

The Times's Tempus column weighs up recruitment firm SThree, which has had a pretty rough time as of late, 
falling 35 per cent in the last 12 months.
The case for a buy is based on geographic spread, with nearly 80 per cent of profits generated outside of the 
traditional British IT market. The Middle East, India and Brazil are much happier hunting grounds now.
While banking recruitment is obviously not going well, oil and gas is booming and SThree often returns cash to

FTSE 350: Shares in low-cost airlines should outperform their full-service rivals in 2012
True to form, the airlines occupied their fair share of column inches in 2011 and it's a fair bet that they'll do the 
same this year, too. British Airways and Iberia began trading under their new banner - the irritatingly long-winded 
International Consolidated Airlines Group. The merged business may have settled its spat with the unions, but that 
didn't stop its value from almost halving. EasyJet gave investors a slightly smoother ride - and a second recession 
in three years could play into the budget carrier's hands.
Airline profitability is highly correlated to GDP - they always lose money when global growth falls below 2 per cent - 
so any weakness in western economies will likely impact operators reliant on expensive long-haul routes for 
income. Traffic growth has slowed at IAG, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), warns those 
industry trends will persist: "Continuing economic uncertainty will likely mean market shortcomings deepening as 
we enter 2012," said its director general and CEO, Tony Tyler. "The industry is brittle. Any shock has the potential 
to put us in the red." Failure to solve the eurozone debt crisis would be one such shock.
Still, low-cost airlines like easyJet and Ryanair (not in the FTSE350, owing to its Irish domicile and primary listing) 
should pick up business as travellers favour cheap short haul flights over more expensive routes to far-flung places. 
Shareholders in the company are unlikely to be complaining as they are set to receive a bumper dividend pay-out of 
45p a share in March. This has helped put a tail wind behind the share price of the orange-liveried airline, which has 
risen by over a quarter since September.
Shares in IAG, however, have gone nowhere. Boss Willie Walsh said his "main challenge for 2012" is to offset a 
fuel bill - likely to have been 5bn (GBP4.13bn) last year - in a climate of potentially weaker demand. That was 
before he bought loss-making BMI for GBP172m. Mr Walsh will have his work cut out getting the deal past 
regulators with the 56 valuable Heathrow landing slots intact, and, with a third runway at Heathrow ruled out, Virgin 
boss Sir Richard Branson is already spitting feathers and has promised to fight IAG "every step of the way". The 
Labour Party, too, has called for a full investigation by the competition authorities. This could drag on.
And, while integrating Iberia is going well and benefits should continue to flow, many analysts dismissed IAG's 
ambitious internal forecasts for operating profit of 1.5bn (GBP1.25bn) in 2015. Progress there will be watched 
closely.
Flying on a budget
Carriers have other problems, too. They're all grumbling about a new EU green tax and an increase in UK Air 
Passenger Duty planned for April. David Cameron's European veto could threaten UK business, we're warned, and 
a ban on excessive credit card booking charges by the end of 2012 could hit the budget end hard.

EasyJet faces headwinds like the rest, but enjoys a more defensive position than expensive flag carriers. The board 
may also get a break as major shareholder Sir Stelios busies himself with a new venture in Africa. IAG will flourish 
when the economy improves, but that's unlikely to happen soon and passenger revenue probably won't offset its 
fuel bill this year. BMI, too, could prove a distraction.

A second revenue warning from regional airline Flybe means it's time to sell the shares
Flybe might be Europe's largest regional airline, but size offers little protection when people stop flying and when 
you rely too heavily on one market. A second warning in three months has carved a quarter off the share price and 
Flybe is now the clear sell in a difficult sector.
Flybe's entry into continental Europe helped boost third-quarter revenue by 20 per cent, but the UK is still 
responsible for 70 per cent of its business and conditions in the domestic market have continued to deteriorate. An 
8 per cent drop in underlying sales over the three months represents a "significant shortfall" in expectations, and 
there's no way the carrier will make that up with just a few months of the financial year left, given it admits the latest 
sales trends are bleak. December was particularly bad.
Andrew Fitchie at Investec has torn up his forecast for a GBP6.4m profit in the year to 31 March 2012 in favour of 
an GBP8.5m loss, and he thinks the carrier will leak another GBP1.3m in 2013 (GBP17.1m before).
"Given the likely disappointment over a further downgrade and the remaining uncertain trading outlook, it is difficult 
to see the share performing in the short term," says Mr Fitchie.
Like easyJet and Ryanair, Flybe has cut capacity over the winter in response to weak demand and high fuel prices, 
but, unlike its much larger peers, the carrier has been less successful at passing on price increases to offset rising 
costs. Nor does it have their popular routes, higher operating margins and history of special dividends.
Flybe has had a terrible time since it floated 13 months ago - the shares are down more than 80 per cent from the 
295p float price. Chairman and chief executive Jim French believes the overall strategy is "intact" and that Flybe 
has a "strong future in the medium and long term." That may be true - but right now, business is challenging and 
there are few obvious catalysts for recovery. It's the weakling in the sector and things could still get worse. Sell.

O'Leary pockets millions just as passenger numbers fall, but director buys still outnumber sells
There were some hefty selling going on this week. One that caught the eye was Ryanair, whose ebullient founder 
Michael O'Leary shed four million shares just as the airline announced its first drop in monthly passenger numbers. 
The fall was mainly down to aircraft being grounded over the winter season; Ryanair expects numbers to pick up 
again in the spring, and had originally guided for a bigger fall in November. Furthermore, Mr O'Leary still owns 
another 50m shares.
Steeves cashes in
Some sectors of the market are just more defensive than others and anyone involved in offering services to the 
healthcare industry is not going to be overly concerned by chaos in the markets. So it has proved with chief 
executive and founder of Synergy Health Richard Steeves, who has just sold 1.25m shares for a combined total of 
more than GBP10.7m, one of the heftiest share sales recorded recently. The share price has been reasonably 
stable on the back of a solid trading statement in November, so Dr Steeves seems to have the opportunity to cash 
in on an open trading window to mitigate an impending tax charge relating to his offshore holdings, just as investors 
are desperately searching for a safe haven.

Evans secures extra shares
Digital Barriers managing director Colin Evans scooped up 60,000 ordinary shares at 155p each in the company on 
29 November as a sign of his long term commitment to the company. The purchase raised his holding in the buy 
and build business to 505,625 ordinary shares, representing 1.2 per cent of the group. Indeed, his purchase also 
managed to shore up some interest in the shares which have advanced to currently trade at 165p each. Without 
any City forecasts on the group - - as a result of its highly acquisitive strategy to consolidate the homeland security 
sector - - shares in the company had started to lose appeal among nervous investors. But we remain believers in 
the strategy and the management team which includes much of Detica's key players, including Tom Black. Still a 
buy.

Ryaniar has boosted its passengers numbers, but the airline expects to ground up to 80 aircraft in the face of higher 
fuel costs
Ryanair delivered a polished first-half performance which saw net profits rise 20 per cent in the period to 544m 
(477m) and passenger numbers grow 12 per cent at 44.7m.
That performance was even more impressive given that fuel costs, which account for 44 per cent of total operating 
costs, rose 37 per cent. Without these, rigorous cost controls left adjusted unit costs flat, despite such factors as a 2 
per cent pay increase and higher charges at Dublin airport. Against that, the airline pushed through a 13 per cent 
increase in average fares, while ancillary sales rose 15 per cent to 487m.
Ryanair is also opening more operating bases, most recently in Manchester. Operations from Wroclaw in Poland 
and Baden Baden in Germany are expected to open in March next year, too, and negotiations continue with a view 
to opening a base in Warsaw. However, management remains cautious, pointing out that second half traffic 
numbers are expected to fall 4 per cent as the company grounds up to 80 aircraft as a result of higher fuel costs.
But, based on third-quarter bookings and limited visibility for the fourth quarter, Ryanair is raising full-year net profit 
estimates by 10 per cent to 440m, against 400.7m for 2011, which broker Davy estimates would imply EPS of 
around 30A per share.

The Treasury and Financial Services Authority are heading for a clash over a proposal to allow bidders for Northern 
Rock's "good" bank to take about GBP500 million out of the lender. The Treasury is keen to achieve a price of 
GBP1 billion and is exploring the idea of allowing the successful bidder to liberate about half of it after the deal, 
sources said, according to the Times.
Europe's banking woes have begun to set off a funding crunch in the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, and 
Eastern Europe, leaving them nakedly exposed as the rich world slides into a double-dip downturn. Corporate bond 
issuance has collapsed by three-quarters over the past three months in these regions, touching the lowest level 
since depths of the Great Recession in early 2009, according to Bloomberg data, the Telegraph reports.

Global banking regulators have brushed off criticism from bank chief executives, saying that they will press ahead 
with plans for capital surcharges on the largest and most interconnected global banks starting in 2016. The Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision said that it plans to make some technical adjustments to the way global 
systemically important financial institutions, known as G-Sifis, are classified, But people close to the process said 
that they are unlikely to change the rankings, the Financial Times.
Stagecoach has hit back at Labour after it was singled out as the sort of "predator" business that Ed Miliband 
attacked in his party conference speech on Tuesday. Maria Eagle, the Shadow Transport Secretary, is understood 
to have claimed the bus company was a "bad business", taking unjustified rewards of the kind Mr Miliband had 
criticised, according to the Times.
Lloyds Banking Group's attempt to drum up a competitive auction for its 632 branches has been dealt a blow by a 
sharp increase in the cost of the credit line it has pledged to provide bidders. As the September 28 deadline for 
offers passed on Wednesday, only NBNK tabled an indicative bid - of around GBP1.5bn, reports the Telegraph.
British banks have been advised to cut their dividends and bonuses in order to strengthen their balance sheets by 
the financial sector's new super-regulator. The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC), which is due 
to take over the powers of the Financial Services Authority, released a statement yesterday warning about rising 
risks of disruption to financial stability in the UK as a result of the eurozone crisis, the Independent reports.
The Financial Services Authority is sitting in on board meetings of the some of the biggest firms in the City as it 
steps up its surveillance of those institutions it believes could pose a major risk to the financial system. In an 
attempt to rectify some of the criticism it faced in the wake of the collapse of Northern Rock, the FSA is now 
demanding access to the inner workings of big banks and other high-risk groups as part of what Hector Sants, the 
chief executive of the City regulator, regards as an "eyeball-to- eyeball" approach to regulation, says the Guardian.
From next week Ryanair's new prepaid MasterCard will become the only free payment method when booking flights 
with the airline - and the Daily Mail can reveal the terms and conditions of the card. Currently, passengers can 
dodge the GBP6 Ryanair each way administration fee by using any prepaid MasterCard. However, the airline will 
change the rules so that only bookings made with its own brand MasterCard prepaid card will enable passengers to 
dodge the fees. For every transaction and withdrawal abroad, card holders will be charged a whopping 5.75 per 
cent foreign transaction fee, the paper reports.
Retailers have been warned they face a "Christmas Day bloodbath" of closures and insolvencies as they get set to 
meet crunch quarter-day rental payments to their landlords today. The British Retail Consortium played down fears 
that today's payment round would repeat the carnage of June when big retail names like Habitat were forced into 
administration because they could not pay their rent. But it warned it was only delaying the inevitable, the Daily 
Express reports.

Irish carriers Ryanair and Aer Lingus are fighting amongst themselves again, although an end to this unholy affair 
may be near
Children as young as five are cage fighting in front of paying adults, according to the front cover of a recent edition 
of the Metro. And to prove that adults are just big kids, Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington and Ryanair 
motormouth Michael O'Leary are slugging it out in their own ring at Dublin Airport.
Of course, like any of the greatest boxing bouts, there's plenty of history here. Ryanair has twice tried to buy its 
rival, first for 1.5bn (GBP1.3bn) in 2006 and then 748m a couple of years ago - it's worth less than half of that now. 
Both were firmly rejected, but Ryanair had already bought 30 per cent of the business, and has been niggling the 
Irish flag-carrier ever since - possibly with some justification. It bought a 16 per cent stake at 2.42 in 2006 and 
another 9 per cent somewhere around the 2.80 level. The shares now change hands for a miserly 64 cents.
In and out of the ring on a number of occasions since, Ryanair has been mixing it up with Aer Lingus - and the 
authorities - again.
Ding-Ding -
Round One: Mr O'Leary took one on the chin earlier this month when goaded by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), 
which says it's still deciding whether to refer Ryanair's acquisition of its Aer Lingus stake five years ago to the 
Competition Commission.
Round Two: Stephen McNamara, Ryanair's head of communications, lands the airline's first punch. "This OFT 
investigation sets a damaging precedent for future UK mergers, as it appears that the OFT now intends to second 
guess and become involved in mergers up to nine years after the transaction, only once all EU appeals have been 
completed." Fair point.
Colm Barrington
Round Three: Irish transport minister Leo Varadkar says the government might sell its 25 per cent stake in Aer

happy. Ryanair says it won't bid for the shares and may even sell its own stake to the eventual buyer. Honours 
even.
Round Four: "The board of Aer Lingus can no longer ignore its own appalling performance, which has destroyed 
more than 1.3bn of shareholder value over the past five years as a public company," fires back Mr O'Leary a week 
later. Ouch! A flurry of punches follow. He calls for Aer Lingus to publish the report into the 30m tax bill sparked by 
its leave and return redundancy scheme "debacle", pay a 0.2 special dividend, and ask shareholders before paying 
any more money into the defined benefits pension scheme. The Aer Lingus board must "begin to restore 
shareholder value which they have so spectacularly destroyed over the past five years". Round to Mr O'Leary.
Michael O'Leary
Round Five: And it's all Ryanair. Aer Lingus is winded when Mr O'Leary releases a letter from the Aer Lingus 
pension scheme confirming the deficit in March was $400m-500m and that it's "significantly larger" now. The 
trustees also want 34m paid to the Irish government pension levy over the next four years. "The company's cash 
pile has been treated as a piggy bank for the benefit of the Aer Lingus unions and staff," cries Mr O'Leary. Bang! 
Aer Lingus is beginning to wobble.
Round Six: Finally - Colm Barrington fights back. In a three-page letter addressed to his nemesis, he corrects 
"several significant misrepresentations about Aer Lingus", among them the dividend. It will be paid "when there is a 
more durable recovery and consequent earnings visibility," he says. The Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) 
is "no longer a relevant issue," he adds, before finishing with a quick combination. Ryanair is "a shareholder (and 
our largest competitor) whose record includes a series of attempts to devalue Aer Lingus for its own 
ends...Ryanair's second frivolous and unsuccessful bid for Aer Lingus in late 2008 and early 2009 had a much 
greater cost to Aer Lingus and its shareholders than the Revenue settlement - excluding your own acceptances, 
only 0.1 per cent of Aer Lingus shareholders accepted your offer made in December 2008." Bang, bang, bang -
That final flurry claws it back for Mr Barrington and, for now, we're calling it a draw.
Still, next Wednesday's investor day should prove interesting. Ryanair has been invited. Will it attend? We hope so.
Meanwhile, over at easyJet , chief executive Carolyn McCall has shown what it takes to silence a noisy 
shareholder. Dividends worth GBP190m, including a GBP150m special payout, announced yesterday, will hand 
increasingly disruptive founder and 38 per cent shareholder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou GBP72m.
And surprise, surprise, this morning Stelios has withdrawn his request for an EGM to sanction the sacking of 
director Rigas Doganis. Mr Doganis became a target when he backed plans to buy new planes rather than pay a 
dividend!
Everyone has their price, it seems, and that includes Michael O'Leary.

TUI revenues rise; easyJet raises guidance but warns on fuel; Zoo Digital encouraged by progress. Plus a summary 
of business press headlines
a While its perennial rival Thomas Cook has been beset with difficulties in recent months, shedding senior 
executives like sunburnt skin, TUI Travel has sailed serenely on, albeit in relatively choppy seas.
a No-frills airline easyJet has raised full-year profits guidance, paving the way for a bumper special dividend, but it 
warned its 2012 fuel bill will increase by around GBP220m compared to the prior year.
a Film software firm Zoo Digital said whilst it is still early in the current financial year, it believes that it is on track to 
meet market expectations.
a Tim Breedon, chief executive of the insurance group Legal & General, is to retire from the company at the end of 
next year.
a Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington has denied claims by fellow airline Ryanair's chief executive Michael 
O'Leary that Aer Lingus's board has "continually ignored" Ryanair, which has a 30 per cent stake in its rival.
a Songbird Estates said adjusted NAV per share increased by 7p or 3.7 per cent to 194p in the six months ended 
30 June 2011 as property values continue to pick up.
a Accountancy software titan Sage is to get shot of its Sage Software Healthcare subsidiary for $320m (GBP205m), 
and use the money to finance a share buyback.
a The annual general meeting on Thursday of online betting marketplace Betfair could be a lively affair after a year 
in which the company has seen a number of senior managers quit the company.
Business press headlines:
Vodafone has been accused by India's tax authorities of creating an "artificial tax avoidance scheme" for its 
$11.2bn takeover of Hutchison-Essar in 2007. Speaking at the start of a hearing in India's Supreme Court over 
$2.5bn in taxes being disputed by the British company, the Solicitor-General claimed that the telecoms giant had 
"concealed the facts" in the case, the Times reports.
22 September
Britain lost GBP35bn in uncollected taxes last year - the equivalent of 7.9 per cent of the annual revenue, the 
Treasury has admitted. The so-called 'tax gap', which is the difference between the amount of tax due and the total 
collected, was reduced from 8.1 per cent of revenues from the year before but critics argue that the figure is still too 
high, the Telegraph says.
Tar balls that turned up on the US Gulf coast this month are linked to BP's oil spill last year, signalling that the area 
is still not fully cleaned up, a study has found. Researchers from Auburn University found the environmental impact 
of the spill is continuing 17 months since oil leaked into the ocean, after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon, 
according to the Telegraph.
Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google, denied that the search company "cooked" its search results to gain an 
advantage over rivals, as he fended off persistent questioning during a Senate hearing into how the search giant 
wields its online power. In the most public airing yet of the growing questions in Washington about Google's 
influence, Mr Schmidt on Tuesday calmly rebuffed suggestions that Google unfairly favoured its own services at the 
expense of companies that rely on attracting visitors from its search engine, says the Financial Times.
The Halifax (owned by Lloyds Banking Group) is to offer savers the chance to win monthly cash prizes of up to 
GBP100,000 in a direct attack on Premium Bonds. Halifax will give away half a million each month from December 
with the promotion lasting for at least 12 months. Simon Kenyon, director of savings at the bank, denied the move is 
a gimmick. "We're trying to challenge the savings market," he said. While the promotion is new to the UK, it is 
common practice in the US and Australia, the Independent writes.
The famous Scottish sweetmaker behind childhood favourites Highland Toffee and Wham bars has collapsed into 
administration, putting more than 100 jobs at risk. Although children have been ploughing their pocket money into 
Millar McCowan's famous sticks of toffee for generations, the company has a history of financial problems and 
confirmed on Wednesday that Grant Thornton had been appointed as administrators of the parent company, New 
McCowans, at the end of last week, the Guardian reports.
Liberal Democrat David Laws warned that businesses and entrepreneurs may be put off locating in the UK if the 
50p rate of income tax is permanent. The former Treasury minister also cautioned his senior Lib Dem colleagues 
against attacking their Conservative coalition partners, claiming they risked making policy concessions more 
difficult, the Daily Mail reports.

ANALYSIS: Business is booming at the Paris Airshow and UK companies are stealing the headlines
A wet start to the 49th Paris International Airshow failed to stem the flow of multi-billion dollar deals and Rolls-
Royce, flying the flag for Britain, picked up its usual haul of big orders, worth $2.9bn (GBP1.8bn) over the first two 
days.
Now under the stewardship of John Rishton, Rolls clinched a $2.2bn contract with Brazil's TAM Airlines for Trent 
XWB engines to power their fleet of Airbus A350s. There's also $360m of business from Abu Dhabi-based airline 
Etihad, more than $250m of orders from China Southern Airlines, $60m from Bahrain's Gulf Air, and a contract with 
Saudi Arabia to fix engines on its C130 military transport aircraft. Away from the whir of engines at Le Bourget 
airport, the company has finally put its dispute with Qantas to bed. An out-of-court settlement over the exploding 
engine on a plane owned by the Australian carrier last November is worth A$95m (GBP62m) to Qantas in 2011.
Significantly, Ryanair made headlines after agreeing to help Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) develop a 
200-seat version of the Chinese plane builder's C919 jet. The Irish budget carrier is unhappy that Boeing, supplier 
of its 737 fleet, is yet to react to upgraded engines on Airbus's more fuel efficient A320. Ryanair chief Michael 
O'Leary is still talking with both companies about a replacement order for at least 200 planes. Boeing still has a 
chance if it can compete on cost.
Paris has provided tens of billions of dollars worth of evidence that high oil prices and a predicted plunge in airline 
industry profits have had little effect on plane manufacturers. Broker Investec believes oil would have to stick above 
$125 a barrel before they did. But Boeing and Airbus are both feeling the heat from competitors and admit their 
duopoly in the commercial aircraft market is effectively over. Efficient 100-200-seater planes from Comac, Brazil's 
Embraer, Bombardier of Canada and Russia's Irkut will guarantee that.
Rolls is our main play in the civil aerospace market, but the shares have disappointed so far during this show. 
According to Investec, they've outperformed the market during air shows over the past seven years by an average 
3.6 per cent, and by 4.8 per cent during the month of the show. Not so far, but there's still time, and with the Qantas 
incident behind it and Tognum deal in the bag, the shares remain a buy at 600p.

RESULTS: Volcanic rumbles prove an unwelcome distraction for Ryanair once again
A new ash cloud from Iceland took the shine off a big increase in full-year profits at Ryanair, which would have 
topped 450m were it not for last year's volcanic chaos. So will the budget airline's warning that passenger traffic will 
halve this year and its fuel bill continue to rise?
Fuel costs leapt 37 per cent to 1.2bn over the 12 months and, with oil prices sticking near $100, an extra 350m will 
be spent on fuel in the coming year. Fares went up 12 per cent and the budget airline "cautiously" expects the same 
again this year, but that extra revenue will only cover the expanding fuel bill, keeping after-tax profits flat. The group 
also says that twice as many planes as last year will sit idle over the winter. Up to 80 on unprofitable routes will be 
grounded, crimping expected traffic growth to 4 per cent in 2012.
But Ryanair spies an opportunity amidst the gloom. High oil prices will force competitors to keep cutting capacity "or 
go bust", giving it the chance to increase market share and expand into new markets.
Broker Davy predicts little change in adjusted EPS for 2011-12 at 27.5A, from 27A last year.

RESULTS: Aer Lingus swings back into profit but faces a turbulent year ahead.
Aer Lingus is back in the black, but that probably won't arrest the recent decline in the Irish carrier's share price. 
Chief executive Christopher Mueller's outlook statement was about as downbeat as they come, warning that higher 
ticket prices and cost savings were unlikely to make up for rising fuel costs and airport charges.
His honesty is prudent - these results lay bare the airline's problems. At first sight, a return to profit on flat sales 
looks encouraging. But once you consider that the airline spent 65.5m less on fuel last year than in 2009, that it has 
only hedged 62 per cent of this year's fuel costs and that oil prices have again risen above $100 a barrel, that result 
looks very vulnerable. Moreover, management has already jacked up prices for last-minute flights - yield per 
passenger rose 12 per cent to 107 last year on reduced capacity - and can't repeat the trick with the Irish economy 
in such a parlous state.
The one hope is that Aer Lingus can cut its staffing costs to within a realistic premium to its main competitor Ryanair 
- no easy task, particularly as the new management team has decided to ditch elements of the cost-reduction plan it 
inherited.
Pending fuel-related downgrades, Irish brokerage Davy expects underlying operating profits of 62m this year 
(57.6m in 2010).

FEATURE: John Hughman surveys the survivors after the Irish crash and finds some gems amongst the rubble.
Travel & leisure - - up for the craic
Paddy Power and Ryanair - Ireland's two largest travel and leisure businesses - have much in common. Both have 
built their success on a limited regard for the conventions of its industry, which means offering extreme value to its 
customers and plenty of controversial publicity stunts. It's an irreverent formula that seems to be working, though.
Ryanair carries more passengers a year than any other carrier - - 73.5m in fact - - backing up its cheeky claim that 
it's the world's favourite airline despite its reputation for putting customers second to profits, which are approaching 
1bn a year. Despite the success of its no-frills formula, the shares have been buffeted by a series of headwinds 
over the years, from volcanic ash to rising fuel bills, and haven't made much progress over the past five years. A 
cyclical recovery in passenger volumes is under way, but it's the structural growth credential underpinned by further 
fleet expansion that's more likely to tempt investors back to the shares. Analysts certainly think so - - 18 out of 27 
covering the stock rate it a buy.
Bookmaker Paddy Power is a surprising international success story, with international expansion offsetting the 
effects of the economic crash in its home market. But, beneath its light-hearted exterior, Paddy Power - - like 
Ryanair - - is a sophisticated operator well positioned to cope with whatever challenges come its way. Expansion 
into the fast-growing Australian market via the acquisition of Sportsbet - which it bought out in a deal worth 
GBP86m in January - is underpinning an earnings upgrade cycle. And as well as further expansion of its UK high 
street operation, it also won the right to provide the online infrastructure for France's PMU in a highly competitive 
tender, a deal that could provide a template for further business-to-business deals. Such initiatives will be all the 
more important given the Irish government's plans to extend Ireland's 1 per cent turnover tax onto online operators.
Food & drink - - appetising exporters
Ask anyone what Ireland's most famous export is, and their answer will almost certainly be Guinness. But while the 
world's most popular stout is now owned by British drinks group Diageo, Ireland packs plenty more punch on the 
food and drink front. Indeed, while the ESRI points out that its economy has been transformed from an agrarian and 
manufacturing economy into one based on high-tech industries, food still forms a substantial component of the 
The best Irish shares
country's exports, worth 7.9bn or 4.9 per cent of the total in 2010. After two years of declines, that marked an 11 per 
cent annual increase, led by a 17 per cent jump in exports of dairy products.
That partly explains why Glanbia and the smaller Donegal Creameries have both seen their share prices rocket in 
the past year - - firm dairy prices as a result of Asian demand are also helpful. Glanbia's export potential looks 
particularly strong, too. Unlike UK peers Robert Wiseman and Dairy Crest, it has significant international interests; 
37 per cent of its revenues come from its US cheese and global nutrition businesses, including its fast-growing joint 
venture in Nigeria with PZ Cussons. And the $144m acquisition of Bio-engineered Supplements and Nutrition 
extends Glanbia's leading US sports nutrition position further still, and has been well received by analysts.
Kerry Group may be the world's largest food ingredients group, and one that is highly regarded by analysts - - a 
combination of branded foods sold in the UK and Ireland and an international ingredients business has delivered 
steady profit growth through thick and thin. But it is bakery products group Aryzta that is making waves on the world 
food stage. It has spent 1.2bn on acquisitions that give it a dominant position in the North American par-baked 
market to complement existing strength in Europe and the UK, and analysts reckon that the group is now looking to 
Asia for its next step. Without a London listing, its shares are harder to buy than Kerry's, but a knockdown rating of 
just 11 times forecast earnings means hunting them down could be worth the effort. With one exception, analysts 
rate the shares a buy.
Meanwhile, drinks group C&C has picked up the mantle from Guinness as Ireland's biggest independent drinks 
company - - its popular cider brands Magners and Bulmers may have seen volumes slip during the downturn, but 
refreshed pricing and marketing strategies put in place by new management have steadied the ship, and the 
disposal of its spirits business has more than covered the cost of what has proved a successful diversification 
strategy that has seen it pick up brands including Gaymers and Tennents. With a neutral debt position expected by 
the year-end, more deals will help it diversify further.
Greencore looks like one to avoid, though, after the collapse of a proposed tie-up with the UK's Northern Foods to 
form a new venture, Essenta. The two companies enjoyed complementary offerings in private label food production, 
and analysts were keen to see capacity removed from a market in which supermarket customers clearly had the 
upper hand at the negotiating table. Now that Northern has instead agreed to a takeover from the UK's so-called 
'chicken king' Ranjit Boparan, the market fundamentals once again look unattractive, and a counterbid from 
Greencore may prove financially costly.
Construction & materials - - bricking it
Companies in the Irish building and materials sector have done well to survive at all, and most are currently a 
shadow of their former selves. Readymix, which makes concrete and concrete materials, saw its share price 
collapse 93 per cent from late 2007 to September 2009, and while there has been some recovery since then, the 
outlook is bleak for as long as the construction industry remains dormant. Indeed, residential and non-residential 
construction activity fell 34 per cent and 31 per cent respectively in the third quarter of 2010. Because of this 
continued weakness we'd still avoid cement group Grafton, whose business is concentrated on construction 
markets in the UK and Ireland.
Even CRH, the world's second largest maker and distributor of building materials, saw profits in the first half of last 
year slide 51 per cent, but the company has been able to effect significant cost reductions. So, while organic growth 
is likely to remain stunted, there have been sufficient funds to continue with a programme of bolt-on acquisitions.
In fact CRH has retained the firepower to make 31 acquisitions in 2010, spending 540m in the process. All of these 
were made outside Ireland, and have strengthened the group's materials presence in Switzerland as well as 
tapping into the attractive German distribution market. And the group's European sanitary, heating and plumbing 
materials platform has been expanded through acquisitions in Belgium and Germany. At the same time, with one 
eye on a recovery in US markets, CRH made nine acquisitions there, adding 336m tonnes of aggregates reserves.
Kingspan's ability to weather the economic storm in reasonable condition also reflects a diverse revenue stream, 
with a bulk of the business coming from outside Ireland. International trading has been upbeat, with sales of 
The best Irish shares
insulated panels in central and Eastern Europe up by 30 per cent in the third quarter, and by 21 per cent in North 
America, while business in Australia has also been solid, helping to boost insulation board sales by 21 per cent. 
And the group's position has been strengthened by the acquisition last November of the European insulation 
activities of CRH for 120m.
But despite an increase in sales in the first nine months of last year, the final quarter is expected to have been 
affected by the bad weather, and management conceded that margins have come under pressure from rising 
chemical and steel costs, increases that it has been unable to pass on to its customers. Housebuilder Abbey's 
business model is not all that typical because it is sitting on 45m (GBP38m) in cash and holds 55m in UK 
government bonds. The housebuilding side remains profitable, but unit sales have continued an inexorable slide 
from over 800 to just 172 in the six months to October last year. By the company's own admission, and this could 
apply to the construction and materials sector in general, the outlook for the foreseeable future is quite bleak.
Industrials - - a world of opportunity
Just as Ireland's agribusinesses can boast strong global prospects, so its 'old' industrials continue to thrive despite 
Ireland's economic troubles. Smurfit Kappa remains one of Europe's largest packaging groups, operating in 21 
countries across the continent. It continued to consolidate its position with the 43m acquisition of Mondi's UK 
corrugated packaging business last April, and is on the lookout for further assets. Those could be in Latin America, 
which accounts for just under a fifth of revenues today, but which is seeing market growth of 9 per cent a year and 
offers superior margins. That's important, because the group faces the challenge of passing back rampant cost 
inflation to its customers in mature markets. But it's been successful so far, and analysts believe there's scope for 
further margin improvement in 2011 and that the market is currently undervaluing this potential.
Distributor DCC is also feeling the benefits of an ongoing diversification away from Ireland, which now accounts for 
just 17 per cent of its profits, down from around 40 per cent five year ago. Analysts are particularly excited about the 
prospects for its energy division, which is the UK's leading distributor of oil and LPG and is expanding into Europe. 
Having grown sales at 23 per cent a year for a decade, it's been the key driver of growth at the group and now 
accounts for 60 per cent of profits, and analysts believe that with 1.5bn of financial firepower it's likely to be at the 
heart of further consolidation of this fragmented industry.
Technology, media and telecoms (TMT)
For all of Ireland's reputation as a home to high-tech industry, it has produced relatively few high companies of its 
own - - its stock market hosts just two technology business, and one of these, Norkom, has just received a bid 
approach from UK defence group BAE Systems. It will pay 217m for the high-tech security group, nearly 50 times 
cash profits and a 36 per cent premium to the price before the approach - - that looks like a good deal for 
shareholders.
Elsewhere, Ireland's TMT sector still has a rather 'old media' feel to it. Independent News & Media's struggles have 
been well documented, in particular the difficulties of The Independent newspaper and its eventual disposal to 
Russian businessman Alexander Lebvedev. But its titles in markets such as Australasia and South Africa are 
starting to benefit from a pick-up in advertising, asset sales have reduced debt and restored the group to 
profitability, and investment in new initiatives such as digital editions and paywalls are expected to offset continuing 
advertising weakness across its Irish titles. This could be the start of the long road to recovery.
Broadcaster UTV is also benefiting from a domestic advertising recovery, albeit a very slow one. And although its 
international footprint only stretches as far as talkSport in the UK, securing Premier League coverage rights has 
boosted audiences, and with profits moving in the right direction the shares look cheap.
Healthcare
Despite the nation being well known as a hub of scientific endeavour, Ireland's pharmaceutical industry is woefully 
under-represented on the Irish exchanges. Aside from the once high-flying Elan, which has never fully recovered 
from an accounting scandal in 2002 , Ireland's listed pharma companies are mainly in the business of supporting 
The best Irish shares
the global giants that have set up shop in the country. Icon - - which like Elan isn't listed in London - - helps drug 
developers organise clinical trials, while United Drug is an important distributor. It's a mature low-margin business, 
with relatively limited growth prospects, but analysts like the company for its steady cash flows and attractive 
dividend yield.
See the Chronic Investor blog, where Julian Hofmann explores why there is a dearth of biotech investment 
opportunities on the Irish stock market.
Resources stocks - written by Martin Li
Where Tullow has led the way, many other Irish resource companies have followed, not least Dragon Oil. Dragon 
Oil is focused on the Cheleken area off the coast of Turkmenistan in the eastern section of the Caspian Sea. The 
Caspian is a prolific region for oil and gas and was the only geographical area mentioned individually in the 
International Energy Agency's latest World Energy Outlook as having the potential to grow production sufficiently to 
enhance global energy security.
Dragon has historically struggled to grow its output, constrained by rig availability and pipeline and infrastructure 
bottlenecks that limited significant growth of output that was, admittedly, already substantial at over 40,000 barrels 
of oil per day (bopd). A recent operational update confirmed that average production in 2010 increased 5.5 per cent 
to 47,211 bopd from 2009's 44,765 bopd. New pipeline and processing infrastructure that came into operation late 
last year should open the way to further output growth this year, although the scale of this growth remains to be 
proven.
As a development rather than exploration company, we think there's more upside to be found elsewhere. But the 
stock is nevertheless highly rated by analysts - - eight out of 14 have it on a buy, and Dubai's ENOC holds a 
significant stake.
Miner Kenmare Resources has been much in the news lately, mostly not for reasons the company would have 
chosen. A tragic accident at its Moma titanium dredge mine in Mozambique flooded a local village and swept a four-
year-old girl to her death. The accident and a bizarre defamation case involving a former director have both seen 
the company hit with compensation claims.
But mining resumed in November and a recent update confirmed that the temporary suspension didn't prevent the 
company from increasing production in the second half of last year. Kenmare has also negotiated significant price 
increases with customers for 2011 and remains on schedule to expand production from a substantial resource base 
that should support mining for over 100 years.
At the smaller end of the market, Irish-quoted resources plays include Providence Resources, which is entering a 
busy year of exploration and appraisal drilling and recently received initial confirmation that its ULYSSES gas 
storage project off the coast of Dublin is economically and technically feasible. Petroceltic has exploration and 
appraisal assets in Algeria, Tunisia and Italy. Its most advanced project is the Isarene permit in Algeria, where the 
company recently began a drilling programme to appraise a substantial discovery.

RESULTS: Another strong set of numbers from Ryanair, although rising fuel bills are a worry
Ryanair shrugged off the Icelandic volcano EyjafjallajAkull and air traffic control strikes across southern Europe to 
post a 10 per cent uplift in passenger numbers for the half year to 30 September. Much of the growth is thanks to 
the strong recovery in leisure travel this year, but the Irish no-frills carrier also claimed it was taking market share 
from the big three national airline groups.
Revenues and costs both increased more than passenger numbers. That's partly because new bases at Faro, 
Malaga and Malta pushed up the average flight length, but fuel costs have been rising even faster - up by 44 per 
cent over the period. Ryanair also reported almost 32m (GBP28m) of one-off costs including flight refunds and 
expense claims associated with the volcano, but that was less than the initial estimate of 50m.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary unleashed his trademark ire at the usual suspects. He blamed the UK and Irish 
governments for seeking to plug their budget deficits with airport taxes, and the Belgium, French and Spanish 
governments for not standing up to the "highly paid bureaucrats" at the air traffic control unions.
The company guided up full-year profit expectations in light of strong winter bookings, so Irish brokerage Davy now 
forecasts full-year adjusted EPS of 27A.

More analysis of company results
Ryanair is definitely the most compelling investment in the airline sector, with reliable cash generation and growth. 
But there appears to be upward pressure on costs, and a rating of 16 times earnings forecasts is a bit steep for a 
company without regular dividends. Fairly priced.

BROKERS' VIEWS: Good news on trading, but strategic and legal turbulence ahead
What's new
a Passenger numbers rising
a Profits to beat earlier guidance
a Hit from air traffic controllers' strike
a Agreement reached with Stelios over use of 'easyJet' brand
easyJet's trading update earlier this month - covering the 12 months to end-September - contained plenty of good 
news for shareholders. Indeed, passenger number grew an impressive 8 per cent year on year and the load factor 
(passengers as a proportion of available seats) was up 1.5 percentage points to 87 per cent.
Against that backdrop, management now expect pre-tax profit for the year to be slightly above GBP150m - a big 
improvement on easyJet's previous guidance range of GBP100m-GBP150m. What's more, that outcome takes 
account of an expected GBP6m cost from air traffic controller strikes in Spain, Greece and France, as well as a 
further GBP60m hit that's associated with the Icelandic volcanic eruption in the spring.
But easyJet faces plenty of issues. To begin with there's the poor punctuality problem at Gatwick. That led founder 
and largest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, to threaten legal action if standards did not improve. Tackling that 
punctuality issue could mean re-hiring staff which, in turn, may impact easyJet's GBP190m cost-cutting programme. 
While the airline's focus on key airports - unlike rivals such as Ryanair - could also present cost problems should 
any of those airports raise their prices.
On a positive note, the disagreement over the right to use the 'easy' brand were resolved this week with Stelios 
receiving an annual 0.25 per cent of easyJet's sales as a licensing fee. The payment is fixed at GBP3.9m and 
GBP4.95m for the first two years of the agreement.
Numis Securities says...
easyJet flies high
Hold. easyJet's pre-close update is encouraging. Improving fundamentals in the airline industry along, we suspect, 
with a boost from poor UK summer weather, have made for a strong fourth quarter. But Sir Stelios's remarkable 
campaign of shareholder activism is undermining the attraction of the shares. It is difficult to see marginal new 
investors being enticed into the shares in such circumstances and we are concerned that existing shareholders may 
lose patience. Expect cash profits for end-September 2010 of GBP220m.
Commerzbank says...
Buy. We have increased our full-year 2010 pre-tax profit estimate from GBP143m to GBP157m, giving adjusted 
EPS of 27.8p. And on the back of the favourable yield trend and given that the significant one-off hits will fall away 
next year (Icelandic volcano, air traffic controllers' strike action), we have also fine-tuned our 2011 estimate 
upwards from GBP228m to GBP239m. Our price target is 500p.
easyJet's shares soared 10 per cent to 423p and are now above the level of our recent sell tip (370p, 27 Aug 2010). 
So although easyJet isn't the only airline that will benefit operationally as recovery slowly feeds through, there was 
enough in the trading update to warrant upgrading our advice on the shares to fairly priced.

Jennison acquired in December last year. The combined group has been busy developing five operating segments: 
audit tax and advisory, turnaround and corporate recovery, risk management, specialist taxation and financial 
management. And it has been especially successful in developing greater levels of recurring revenue, while 
exposure to pending cuts in government expenditure is confined to just the risk management division. Steps have 
been taken here to protect profitability by targeting services that offer the potential to reduce costs and improve 
efficiency. Consensus estimates are for pre-tax profits of GBP23.9m and EPS of 6.56p, rising to GBP38.1m and 
8.52p next year.

RESULTS: On whatever measure you take, Dart's shares are cheap
A year ago Dart Group was cautious about trading prospects - and rightly so as the 2009-10 results indicate. Before 
unallocated items, aviation revenues were GBP14.4m down at GBP312m but profits plunged by more than half to 
GBP15.8m as margins were squeezed by a combination of reduced demand and higher dollar fuel costs. Dart 
makes no mention of new competition from Ryanair at Jet2's all-important base of Leeds Bradford International 
airport; however, it did manage to increase individual customer spending.
Yet, despite this disappointing result, the share price rose slightly on news of the figures and with good reason. For 
starters, over the year end-March net cash balances have jumped from GBP11.8m which is most encouraging even 
if a lot of that cash represents pre-summer flight deposits. Second, the 'second string' business, Fowler Welch-
Coolchain, a supermarket food and drinks distributor, turned in a sterling performance with a near-GBP10m 
increase in sales to GBP122.5m to producing a profits advance from GBP4.1m to GBP7.4m. The acquisition of a 
competitor and new client wins also helped boost performance.
Dart hopes to grow both businesses in 2010-11. On that basis, broker Arden forecasts turnover to rise to GBP442m 
with adjusted profits (excluding GBP3m for the volcanic dust storm) advancing from GBP18.9m to GBP21m. 
Earnings rise from 9.4p to 10.7p.

Airline profits to take off

Global aviation might actually make money this year, but Europe will be the laggard
Few industries have destroyed shareholder wealth so comprehensively and consistently as airlines. So there were 
more than a few raised eyebrows in Berlin when the International Air Transport Association (Iata) used its annual 
meeting to announced radically upgraded earnings forecasts for the global industry. Having previously expected 
$2.8bn (GBP1.9bn) of losses in 2010, it now thinks airlines will notch up $2.5bn of profit.
"The global economy is recovery from the depths of the financial crisis much more quickly than could have been 
anticipated. Airlines are benefiting from a traffic rebound that is pushing the industry into the black," said director 
general Giovanni Bisignani.
But the picture isn't as rosy as it first sounds. That $2.5bn profit is expected to be made on sales of $545bn, giving 
a miserable net margin of 0.5 per cent - - well below the cost of capital, and a graphic illustration of the industry's 
lack of pricing power.
And the money is being made in Asia and North America, not Europe. Iata now expects Asian airlines to make 
$2.2bn and North American players to net $1.9bn, but has downgraded its forecast losses in Europe from $2.2bn to 
$2.8bn, citing "a stagnating economy, strikes, natural disasters and a currency crisis".
British Airways may be less exposed to the euro's woes than continental flag-carriers, but it is even more vulnerable 
to industrial action. As the latest 15-day batch of strikes draws to a close, neither chief executive Willie Walsh nor 
Unite, the union representing most of BA's cabin crews, show any sign of budging from the positions they stated a 
month ago. That's frustrating for shareholders, since the original dispute about staffing levels has now largely been 
settled - the two sides are now bickering over the suspension of travel perks for employees who walked out.
The impact of the action was evident in airlines' May travel statistics. Budget operators easyJet and Ryanair posted 
year-on-year passenger traffic gains of 8 per cent and 17 per cent respectively as BA announced a 14 per cent 
decline. It also estimated the financial impact of the strike at GBP7m per day - - suggesting the total profit impact for 
the 15 days was GBP105m.
Airline profits to take off
Iata's forecasts are credible: without trade disputes and fierce competition from low-cost carriers, modest profits 
from flag-carriers are to be expected as demand recovers. But an improving global picture is no reason to buy sickly 
BA, which at 189p remains a sell.

RESULTS: Ryanair is planning a hefty special dividend - but a sustained airline recovery remains too early to call
"Manifestly unfair, disproportionate and discriminatory" was how Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary 
described EU passenger regulations after ash cloud disruption from the Icelandic volcano cost the budget airline an 
estimated 50m (GBP43m). Still, improved yields, additional routes and, crucially, lower fuel costs helped boost 
earnings.
Indeed, Ryanair's fuel costs fell 29 per cent in the period to 894m, compared with 1.26bn last year - the group's fuel 
needs are now 90 per cent hedged at $730 (GBP507) a tonne for 2011. Total operating expenses, excluding fuel, 
were 1.69bn, or 3 per cent lower than 2009. And the group's operating margin improved eight percentage points to 
13 per cent. However, tight cost control was was not enough to offset a 13 per cent slide in fare prices, although 
management now expects these to rise between 5-10 per cent this year because of additional routes. Fuel costs 
are also slated to rise by 300m in 2011, but cash profits are forecast to land in a 350m-375m range.
What's more, the cancellation of talks with Boeing for 200 new aircraft will mean much lower capital expenditure - 
so Ryanair expects to pay a 500m special dividend (or 34A a share) in October.

More analysis of company results
The planned special dividend implies a tasty looking yield of 9.8 per cent. But a share price rating in the upper teens 
isn't such a bargain, there's the possibility of further volcano-based disruption, and a sustained airline sector 
recovery remains too early to call. On that basis, the shares look up with events. Fairly priced.

easeJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou turns to guerilla warfare in dispute over airline strategy
Carolyn McCall must be wondering what she has let herself in for. When easyJet's new chief executive arrives on 
July 1, she will wade into a bitter battle over the low-cost airline's strategy that has moved out of the boardroom and 
into the public domain.
To the City's bewilderment, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou last week announced his decision to resign as a non-executive 
director of the low-cost airline "in order to lead shareholder activism". He believes that, in the face of rising oil 
prices, easyJet's aggressive capacity expansion plans are no longer appropriate. Instead, he thinks the airline's 
primary focus should be on improving its profit margins and returning cash to investors. His forcefully worded 
statement accuses management of "squandering shareholders' funds on more expensive aircraft that will probably 
destroy shareholder value".
The argument is nothing new. Sir Stelios first raised concerns about the company's expansion strategy in mid 2008, 
when the oil price was at an all-time high. But then commodity prices plunged in the recession, and in June 2009 he 
finally agreed to a capacity growth figure of 7.5 per cent per year, hailed by management at the time as a resolution 
to what had become an open dispute.
The apparent truce last summer is one reason why analysts are surprised by Sir Stelios's latest move. "Airplanes 
need to be ordered years in advance, so you need long-term growth plans. You can't chop and change at short 
notice," points out Gert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon. Another reason is the timing, six weeks before the arrival of 
a new chief executive. If Sir Stelios wants a change of strategy, it's unclear why he doesn't just take the question up 
with the new boss when she arrives.
Sir Stelios's stance has one implicit supporter: Michael O'Leary, chief executive of rival no-frills carrier Ryanair. Mr 
O'Leary announced last December his airline had cancelled its jet orders for 2013-2016 because it wasn't happy 
with the terms and conditions. Faced with radically reduced capital expenditure for the period, Ryanair is to pay 
dividends 
instead

00144f2af8e 8/Ryanair-wings-clipped.jsp Ryanair is to pay dividends instead.
Sir Stelios tries to ground easyJet
European airlines still desperately need to cut capacity. We agree with Sir Stelios that a more mature airline 
industry being run for profits and dividends would be welcome. But his handling of the issue has been quixotic and 
is not guaranteed to achieve its objective. Even after the falls, easyJet's shares are trading on between 15 and 22 
times earnings, which is high enough.

SECTOR FOCUS: Shares in British Airways and the other flag carriers are enjoying a cyclical bounce, but the 
structural health of their business model is still in question.
Strikes, price wars, massive losses, merger activity, management squabbles - airlines have hit the headlines far 
more often than they have wanted since economic crisis struck. But the sector's woes didn't start when Lehman 
went bust and triggered the latest economic slump. The sector is in an almost-permanent state of upheaval. Shares 
in British Airways (BA) still trade at less than a third of their 1997 peak, and have broadly underperformed the All-
share for over a decade.
It's not hard to see why. The huge profits that flag carriers like BA and Aer Lingus in Ireland once earned as 
national monopolies have been eroded by low-cost upstarts such as easyJet and Ryanair, who don't have the 
bloated cost bases of their older rivals, and by passengers who have got used to the lower prices. Add to that the 
rising oil price, which accounts for about a third of airline operating costs, and the dismal fate of the old industry 
model looks sealed.
Old favourites
This grand narrative doesn't explain current investor sentiment, however. Shares in BA have risen 33 per cent year-
to-date, compared to just 7 per cent for the FTSE All-Share index. Most stock analysts have the company on a buy.
The optimism certainly has nothing to do with the latest monthly statistics. Ryanair and easyJet reported year-on-
year passenger growth of 13 and 14 per cent respectively in March. In sober contrast, BA posted a 15 per cent 
decline, which suggests a rapid loss of market share.
This can be blamed in part on a much-publicised strike by the company's cabin crew. Seven days of industrial 
action over pay and staffing levels has cost BA an estimated GBP40-45m. No resolution to the dispute has yet been 
found. Ominously, however, the airline also said "planned winter capacity reductions" were partly responsible for 
the fall, suggesting it has downgraded its demand expectations.
But the market is bullish on BA despite these headwinds because of the buzz surrounding its projected merger with 
the Spanish flag-carrier Iberia, signed this month. The companies say the deal will generate annual synergies of 
Enjoy the flight
400m (GBP352.47) after five years and investors are also excited about the prospect of the company flying to more 
growth markets in Latin America.
Consolidation story
Consolidation makes sense in a mature industry with high fixed costs. BA and Iberia are not alone. Ryanair has 
twice tried to acquire Aer Lingus, only to be frustrated first by the competition authorities, and second by the Irish 
government, which owns a residual 25 per cent stake in the ailing Irish carrier. Further afield, Lufthansa has been 
gobbling up local rivals like Swiss, while US Airways resumed talks with United Airlines this month after a two-year 
pause.
The airline industry would already be much less fragmented but for an arcane set of regulations introduced in the 
wake of the Second World War, when politicians still talked of securing the economy's "commanding heights". 
These blocked trans-European deals until the European Union largely unwound them in the 1990s but still prevent 
an official trans-Atlantic merger.
BA has tried to skirt the regulatory obstacles by striking up an alliance with American Airlines (AA) that would be 
protected under US law by so-called 'anti-trust immunity', as Air France KLM has already done with Delta. This 
would put BA on a much stronger competitive footing, as it could legally collude with AA on fares, capacity and 
timetabling. But the deal has not yet received regulatory approval, either in Washington or Brussels, and faces 
ferocious opposition from Richard Branson on behalf of Virgin Atlantic, which would be BA - AA's main rival.
The BA-Iberia merger also requires the competition authorities' support, but as both companies made losses last 
year it is expected to pass. A larger obstacle is BA's GBP3.7bn pension deficit. Iberia can pull out of the merger if it 
isn't convinced by the UK carrier's pension recovery plan. But after BA management struck a deal with unions last 
month for employees to raise their contributions, the merger looks on track to complete in December, as planned.
Playing the cycle
The other reason analysts like BA is its exposure to economic recovery. Neil Glynn, an airlines analyst at Credit 
Suisse, estimates its share of premium revenues - business-class flights and services - at 40 per cent of group 
sales. This compares with 30 per cent at rivals Air France KLM and Lufthansa. BA is also the strongest European 
player in the trans-Atlantic market, which led the downturn and is expected to lead the rebound. As "the purest play 
on a corporate spending recovery", Mr Glynn therefore prefers BA to easyJet and Ryanair, which are more exposed 
to the late-cycle holiday market.
But not everyone agrees. Paul Butler, an airlines analyst at Macquarie, thinks BA shares are pricing in too much 
optimism over the Iberia deal, ongoing strikes, a rapid North Atlantic recovery, and the strategic tie-up with 
American Airlines. He prefers the budget airlines, which can shed costs to fund their aggressive pricing strategies 
without risking industrial action.
The low-cost carriers have their issues, too; particularly over whether to continue adding routes and planes, or 
move to a more mature business model that may include dividends. Yet they have the enduring advantage of 
remaining structurally profitable. Both players also benefited from corporate down-trading during the recession and 
are no longer the pure leisure play they once were. Unfortunately for BA and Aer Lingus, that looks set to endure.
<xmltable>
| |Favourite:
|Ryanair has been observing the old adage that there's no time to get ahead like a recession. It has used its ultra-
lean cost structure to lead a vicious price war that has decimated competitors' passenger numbers. But it remains 
profitable, with net earnings for the year to March 2010 expected to be around 275m. Chief executive Michael 
O'Leary has also signalled that after last year's failed talks with Boeing over jet deliveries, the company will cut 
capital expenditure and start distributing the money to shareholders instead, which should boost the share price.|

| |Outsider:
|Our sell tip on BA last summer caught the market bottom and the stock has bounced since. But we still don't 
believe in the longer-term story. Analysts are projecting a return to profitability only in 2011, based on cost-cutting, 
synergies with Iberia, a successful tie-up with American Airlines, stable oil costs, no more terrorist attacks, and a 'V-
shaped' recovery. Well, maybe - but there are too many unknowns here for us to be comfortable.|
</xmltable>
The long-term headwinds facing the airlines are truly daunting: unwieldy costs, massive overcapacity, a rising oil 
price and crack-pot regulation that leaves companies open to competition but blocks consolidation. It is a climate in 
which it only pays to buy players that can compete in tough conditions. The flag carriers may enjoy a cyclical 
recovery, but their business model is still in structural decline. We're more positive on budget airlines though.

BROKER VIEW: Geoff van Klaveren, a research analyst at Deutsche Bank, says it pays to go down-market while 
the flag-carriers sort their future out.
The flag carriers face an agonising period of consolidation. The hope is that after a couple of years of restructuring, 
they'll find some synergies and start making enough money to cover their cost of capital. As it is, the only European 
flag-carrier that earns the cost of its airplanes, financially speaking, is Lufthansa, which has profitable non-core 
businesses in IT services, ground handling, maintenance and catering.
Both Ryanair and easyJet make a decent return on invested capital and are my top picks. Chapter one for the low-
cost carriers was to attract leisure customers. Now we're onto Chapter two - taking corporate business. They didn't 
used to compete directly with the flag-carriers because they were based in secondary airports. But over the past 
couple of years both budget players both moved into primary airports. EasyJet is now the second largest airline at 
Paris Charles de Gaulle, with a short-haul market share approaching 8 per cent. The only real driver of business 
purchases on short-haul is airport schedules, so as the low-cost carriers expand their timetables, there's no reason 
why they can't take even more market share.
Lufthansa is my only pick among the flag-carriers. Besides being more profitable than the others, it has a stronger 
balance sheet. Lufthansa hasn't faced the same level of low-cost competition as Iberia and BA because there's no 
real alternative to the main, highly congested Frankfurt airport. Gatwick is almost as convenient a London base as 
Heathrow, which has allowed the budget carriers to expand much faster in the UK.

Royal Dutch Shell announces full-year figures on Thursday, and investors will be keen to see if chief executive 
Peter Voser will expand further on recently announced plans to slow down the oil and gas group's expansion plans 
for developing Canada's tar sand deposits. The idea is that Shell will now rely more on conventional gas and oil 
supplies for future growth. The tar sands project is expected to produce 255,000 barrels per day by next year, a far 
cry from initial plans for up to 700,000 barrels per day. Shell has recently signed a deal to recover oil in Iraq, for 
which it will receive $1.9 per barrel once it has paid development costs. Results for 2009 are expected to include a 
sharp decline in profits as a result of a big squeeze on refinery margins. Consensus estimates are for pre-tax profits 
of GBP11.9bn and EPS of 124p.
Thursday also sees the release of full-year numbers from Unilever, and the Anglo-Dutch food giant is expected to 
confirm that tough trading conditions have taken their toll. Earlier attempts to preserve margins by maintaining or 
increasing prices led to a fall in volume as consumers switched to white label goods. So the maker of such 
household brands as PG Tips and Persil has since reduced prices in a bid to stop the erosion in market share. And 
early indications suggest that the move is paying off. Unilever is well-positioned in emerging markets, notably 
China, where annual sales recently topped the 1bn (GBP876m) mark, and where annual growth is expected to be 
at least 15 per cent. Consensus estimates are for pre-tax profits of GBP4.85bn and EPS of 116p.

TIP UPDATE: Ryanair reaps the benefit of lower fuel costs but u-turns on its growth strategy
Flamboyant chief executive Michael O'Leary seems ready to abandon Ryanair's ambitious growth strategy in favour 
of returning money to shareholders, if negotiations with Boeing over the delivery of 200 planes between 2013 and 
2016 onwards don't go its way.
Mr O'Leary said that unless the US aircraft giant was willing to pass-on the benefits of cheaper spare parts and 
more efficient manufacturing, Ryanair would "end its relationship with Boeing and confirm a series of cancellations 
and deferrals." Although it remains to be seen how much of Mr O'Leary's strong words are a bluff, it is clear that the 
incentive to buy extra planes at a discount from the manufacturers is much-diminished, because of the tough post-
crunch conditions in the aircraft broking market. Agreeing sale and leaseback contracts with brokers is now far 
more difficult as finance has been squeezed by banks nervous about asset-backed lending.
Analyst Gert Zonneveld at broker Panmure Gordon also explained that Ryanair is under no pressure to grow 
capacity after 2013, and will instead concentrate on raising average fares and increasing its load factor to grow its 
current 15 per cent share of the European short-haul market. The imperative for that is clear - average fare prices 
fell 17 per cent in the six months, and are expected to decline by a fifth during second half of the year, which the 
company said will lead to "material losses" in the second half.
Even so, management is still sticking to its forecast of profits for the full year at the lower end of the 200m-300m 
range, thanks in part to lower fuel costs, which fell 42 per cent to 246m (GBP220m) in the half. The airline also 
seems to have settled on a consistent fuel hedging policy at 50 per cent of its needs into the first half of 2011, after 
consistently misjudging the market over the past two years.
Meanwhile, the airline took a 13.5m impairment charge on its holding in Aer Lingus, in addition to 93.6m booked 
last year. Panmure expects underlying pre-tax profits of 261m for the full year, giving EPS of 16.8A (from 6.8A in 
2009).

Marks and Spencer releases half-year results on Wednesday, and shareholders are still digesting news that the 
high-street retailer is planning to close more than 100 UK warehouses and carry on with an expansion in China, 
India and eastern Europe. There are also plans that may result in food being sold online. Reducing the number of 
warehouses from 110 to just four is expected to save GBP250m by 2016. The news comes against a backdrop of

Ryanair retaliates
'Saintly' O'Leary fights back after BBC 'hatchet job'
An expose of the allegedly sharp practices employed by budget airline Ryanair spectacularly backfired on the 
BBC's Panorama programme, gifting the never shy and retiring Michael O'Leary a priceless PR opportunity. 
Ryanair will give away 1.1m free flights, 100,000 for each of the 11 misleading claims it says the programme made, 
including charges that the airline had "no respect or dignity for pilots or cabin crew." Mr O'Leary described the 
documentary as "more Bananarama than Panorama." BA, meanwhile, faces the possibility of industrial action by its 
cabin crews due to its plans to cut jobs and implement a pay freeze.

Unsporting behaviour
JJB fundraising hit by hoax
JJB's long-awaited cash call hit a stumbling block after rumours of financial irregularities gave would-be investors 
cold feet. The GBP100m placing and open offer was postponed after major backers demanded an investigation into 
allegations of backhanders paid to chairman Sir David Jones. JJB found no basis for the "pernicious" claims and 
referred the hoax to the Financial Services Authority, allowing the larger-than-expected capital raising to proceed as 
planned. The money will allow JJB to undertake a much needed makeover of its store portfolio and stock lines, 
under its new 'serious about sport' branding.

Tuning out
SEVEN DAYS
ITV leadership crisis deepens
Commercial broadcaster ITV's five-month search for new management descended deeper into farce, after another 
two candidates dropped out of the running for the chairman's post, soon to be vacated by Lord Grade. After former 
Sky chief Tony Ball said no to the role in September, two other possibilities have fallen by the wayside, Sir Crispin 
Davis, former chief of Reed Elsevier, and now BMI entrepreneur Sir Michael Bishop, understood to be the ITV 
board's preferred choice. The company is looking financially healthier, at least - it announced plans to raise 
GBP135m through a convertible bond issue, as it reported stabilising advertising demand.
Britain for sale
Gordon Brown plans to sell more assets
Under fire Prime Minister Gordon Brown provoked a fresh wave of criticism with his latest plans to sell off GBP16bn 
of UK assets within the next two years, including the Dartford crossing, the Tote bookmaker, and the Channel rail 
link. Critics lampooned the move, suggesting that the amount raised from the sales would barely dent the country's 
ballooning deficit, and were in fact no more than a rehash of previously announced intentions. Others suggest that, 
with the bulk of the UK infrastructure already in private hands, it amounted to a 'desperate' fire-sale of the last 
remnants of the nation's family silver that would fail to achieve an appropriate valuation.
Lack of interest
Interest rates to stay low until 2014
A new report from leading economic consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research brought good 
news for homeowners but bad news for savers. It said interest rates would stay at historic lows of 0.5 per cent until 
at least 2011, and would not rise above 2 per cent before 2014. The CEBR added that the key risk to its scenario 
was from rising inflation, although the latest data from the Office for National Statistics revealed that CPI had fallen 
to 1.1 per cent in September, its lowest level in five years. That raised the prospect of expansion of quantitative 
easing (QE), and sent the pound crashing to a five-month low against the euro.

A right Royal mess
Postal strike disrupts business
What began as a series of local wildcat strikes looks set to escalate into a national walkout, with postal workers 
voting three-to-one in favour of industrial action. The dispute over pay and working conditions presents a 
particularly serious challenge to today's more web-centric retail industry - lost sales could hit GBP1.5bn, and the 
CEBR estimates that retailers could incur additional costs of GBP270m as a result. Leading web retailers including 
John Lewis, Argos and Amazon have begun working with other carriers to avoid disruption - alternative providers 
that could benefit include Rentokil-owned CityLink and Business Post.
M&S Factor
Retailer searches for a new management star
Like ITV, succession is a hotly debated subject for Marks and Spencer, but the retailer believes it has found a novel 
way to identify its next chief executive. At its first investor day in 10 years, contenders for the position including 
head of general merchandising Kate Bostock, head of food John Dixon, and FD Ian Dyson, all presented - Sir 
Stuart Rose himself described the beauty parade as "M&S has got talent". Bookmakers believe an external 
appointment is still more likely, although one candidate, Charles Wilson of cash-and-carry group Booker, told us he 
was "not in the market for another position."

RESULT: Aer Lingus needs to demonstrate progress on restructuring or Ryanair will be back
Aer Lingus endured a thoroughly forgettable first half, along with the rest of the airline industry, after fare pressures 
and soaring costs tipped the Irish flag-carrier into big losses.
Aer Lingus carried an additional 85,000 passengers, but the price reductions needed to attract the extra business 
were savage, with an average decline in ticket prices in the half of 17 per cent and a knock-on decline in passenger 
revenues of 11.5 per cent, to 536m.
The company is committed to spending $1bn on capital equipment over the next six years, but management has 
managed to negotiate deferrals on several new Airbus aircraft in order to give it some breathing space in the next 
two years. High salaries for flight and cabin crew - a legacy of its days as a nationalised flag-carrier - will need to be 
trimmed, too, while fuel costs have also been an issue because of the dollar's strength. Fuel accounts for 
approximately one third of all costs, and the average price in the half increased from $925 per tonne in 2008 to 
$993.
A spokesman said that although the airline was not necessarily more susceptible to a renewed approach from 
Ryanair, he admitted that shareholders could get impatient unless there is a clear plan to turn the business around 
by January 2010, the earliest date at which Ryanair can renew its bid.

RESULTS: Managing a budget airline is no easy task but northern-based Dart Group is prospering
Following impressive interims there was never much doubt that Dart Groupwould report excellent full-year results. 
In fact, the dramatic profit improvement is even better if fair value adjustments are ignored. On that basis pre-tax 
profits raced ahead from GBP3.9m to GBP28.8m driven by the performance of budget airline Jet2.com.
The airline flies 21 Boeing 737s out of six northern airports and pushed up profits from under GBP10m to over 
GBP30m. That's not easy when (currently) your website is offering "summer getaways" costing from GBP2.99 to 
GBP29.99. But canny Dart not only hedged its fuel requirements, it also micro-managed its passenger capacity. So 
last summer seat capacity was cut by a fifth and reduced by almost half last winter. Load factors increased and Dart 
has learnt from Ryanair that big money can be made from charging for hold baggage charges, online seat 
reservation and onboard sales. In the half year these revenues jumped by nearly two-thirds to GBP14.93 per 
person.
In contrast the company's logistics business supplying chilled products to supermarkets suffered the loss of two 
contracts and operating profits fell from GBP5.3m to GBP4.1m.
So what are the prospects for 2009-10? Both businesses are expected to grow "cautiously" and summer 2009 seat 
capacity has been cut by seven per cent. Dart is also cautious about winter flights and is sticking to ski resorts and 
hot spots such as Egypt and the Canary Islands.

Dart trades on just 4 times earnings and that is only justified if investors think profits are heading for a big fall. That 
seems unlikely and we upgrade from good value to speculative buy.

OUTLOOK: A summary of key company announcements expected in the coming week
Welcome to the week ahead, our summary of the key company announcements expected next week. Companies 
are no longer obliged to notify the Stock Exchange of results and trading updates, so this list does not claim to be 
comprehensive. You can read company announcements on the IC website here, and our daily online news 
summaries record all key company announcements and business press headlines.
Highlights:
Several of the FTSE big guns across a range of sectors will report in one of the busiest weeks of the year and 
investor interest will be focused on defensive sectors such as tobacco, pharmaceuticals and aerospace and 
defence. British Aerospace reports its half year results on Thursday against a background of uncertainty over 
defence spending in the UK and US. Analysts expect the company to report inline results, but note that the order 
book is now heavily geared towards delivering the F35 Strike Fighter to the US and selling Typhoons to the Saudis. 
City consensus estimates are for half-year pre-tax profits of GBP1.02bn and EPS of 20.9p.
On the same day investors will be able to assess how defensive tobacco has been during the downturn when 
British American Tobacco reports its interim results. The maker of Kent and Lucky Strike cigarettes is expected to 
report solid growth and has started to find favour with fund managers looking for defensive sector bargains. The mix 
of premium and budget brands has been the key to supporting its growth, but the cigarette maker has also been 
acquisitive, having taken control of 85 per cent of Indonesian company PT Bentoel International Investama for 
$494m (GBP300m). Investors will be looking for an update on how the integration process is going. Consensus

RESULT: It's now Europe's biggest airline, but lower margins are the price of victory
Full-year results from leading low-cost airline Ryanair were ahead of consensus, but shares in the budget airline 
group nevertheless shed some three per cent as cautious guidance for the current financial year dented sentiment. 
Compared to previous consensus anticipating around 400m (GBP345m) of net profit in the coming year, Ryanair 
forecasts a figure falling somewhere in the 200-300m range - although it notes this estimate carries a 'heavy health 
warning'.
Crucial to this forecast are fuel prices staying roughly where they are. While Ryanair was notoriously caught out 
unhedged versus soaring fuel costs in the past year - fuel costs jumped 59 per cent from 791m to 1.26bn - for the 
first three quarters of the current financial year Ryanair has locked in significantly lower prices for 90 per cent of its 
fuel, which it reckons should see 450m wiped off its fuel bill in the year to March 2010.
The other crucial variable is yields. Ryanair expects ex-fuel costs per passenger to drop five per cent this year, 
against average fare per passenger dropping some 15-20 per cent to as little as 32 per passenger. Ryanair says its 
own capacity expansions will be a key factor in these declining fares, and the company of course remains 
committed to low-balling the competition out of even more short-haul traffic, especially given the new cost-
consciousness a recession induces in passengers.
Against an eight per cent decline in average fares in 2008-9, which the company says was largely funded by 
savings on non-fuel operating costs, traffic grew 15 per cent to 59m passengers, and the company expects another 
15 per cent growth in passenger numbers in the year ahead. Ryanair says that since March it has become Europe's 
largest airline, edging Lufthansa's eagle off its lofty perch.
The reported figures were shredded by a 222m write-down on the company's minority stake in troubled Irish carrier 
Aer Lingus, plus a further 51.6m in accelerated depreciation on aircraft sold out of the fleet during the year. 
Stripping out these exceptional items, adjusted net profit still fell from 480m in the previous financial year to 105m, 
giving adjusted EPS at 7.1A.
Davy Stockbrokers expects to trim its full-year March 2010 EPS forecast to around 20.3A, in line with Ryanair's 
guidance.

OUTLOOK: A summary of key company announcements expected in the coming week
Welcome to the week ahead, our summary of the key company announcements expected next week. Companies 
are no longer obliged to notify the Stock Exchange of results and trading updates, so this list does not claim to be 
comprehensive. You can read company announcements on the IC website here, and our daily online news 
summaries record all key company announcements and business press headlines.
Highlights:
Ryanair releases full-year results on Tuesday, and investors will be keen to know how Europe's largest discount 
airline is being affected by the global recession. Consumers are taking fewer flights, but there is evidence to 
suggest that budget airlines are gaining market share as passengers switch to cheaper carriers. The company is 
also planning to set up a base in Malta and double the number of tourists it flies to the island. Meanwhile, chief 
executive Michael O'Leary suggested that the company's 29.8 per cent stake in rival loss-making carrier Aer Lingus 
may be written down to zero if accounting rules allow. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of 73m and EPS of 4A.
Full-year results from Johnson Matthey are due for release on Thursday, and the company has already indicated 
that EPS will be within the 85-90p guidance suggested in the third-quarter trading statement. But demand for metals 
used in the making of auto catalysts has been dropping significantly, although demand for pharmaceutical-related 
products appears to have held up well. Moreover, cash flow remains strong, and net debt is expected to have fallen 
by GBP70m from a year earlier. Consensus estimates are for pre-tax profits of GBP256m and EPS of 86.9p.

Virgin profits double, but the structural challenges facing the industry remain formidable
Virgin Atlantic's full-year results contrasted rather sharply with the dreadful numbers BA released last week 
http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/Companies/ByEvent/Results/Analysis/article/20090522/469ecc44-46a7-11de-

824c-00151714 00aa/British-Airways-stalls.jsp- Sir Richard Branson's airline almost doubled pre-tax profits to 
GBP68.4m, compared with GBP34.8m last year, while BA posted its biggest-ever operating loss. So how did the 
man disdainfully dubbed 'the grinning pullover' by a former BA chairman, get it right when others got it wrong?.            
http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/Companies/ByEvent/Results/Analysis/article/20090522/469ecc44-46a7-11de-
824c-00151714 00aa/British-Airways-stalls.jsp
The short answer is that Virgin, through a combination of luck and judgement, managed to get its fuel hedging 
policy right. Alongside staff, fuel is one of airlines' biggest operating expenses, and failing to react to price 
movements can be a very expensive mistake. A classic example of this is Ryanair, which decided to go largely 
unhedged as oil soared to an all-time high, then subsequently took out a limited number of hedges just as the price 
tanked.
Past performance is no guarantee of the future, though, and even Sir Richard must be troubled by the challenges 
that now confront airlines. Top of the list is overcapacity. In Europe alone, the number of available seats has 
doubled to three million since 2002, according to Official Airline Guide.
And while budget airlines have made flying affordable, and an economic and property boom has encouraged more 
overseas travel and second home ownership, neither has generated enough demand to fill these extra seats. 
Passenger numbers in Europe have increased by around 30 per cent during the same period, while according to 
IATA, global passenger revenue grew by a third to $501bn between 2004 and 2007.
That's left airlines trying to compete for a share in a structurally oversupplied market. The cutting of routes, the 
scaling down of services (most recently BA at London City airport), the shedding of jobs and the proliferation of 
mergers, or at least, merger proposals, are all signs that airlines recognise they have over-reached themselves.
Virgin gets lucky, but challenges remain
Historically, airlines have been awful destroyers of shareholder wealth. If they are to avoid a repeat of previous 
meltdowns, they need to re-organise themselves quickly. On top of that, they have to cope with future 
environmental legislation and backlashes against airport expansion. So don't count on Virgin, or any other carrier, 
turning in this kind of profit growth every year.

ANALYSIS: A busy week for airlines with passengers down and bosses out
Declines in premium rate passengers of 13 per cent for British Airways set the scene for a depressing week for 
airlines, as unwanted planes are mothballed at regional airports and even the previously robust budget airlines are 
beginning to be hit by the euro's strength.
Ryanair and easyJet both reported mixed passenger statistics in a sign that the budget sector is also feeling the 
pain. Ryanair's aggressive pricing strategy delivered a 5 per cent increase in passengers to 4.7m in March, but the 
load factor, a measure of passengers carried as proportion of available seats fell two percentage points to 77 per 
cent. easyJet's own load factor fell by the same proportion to 84.9 per cent, although at least its load factor shows 
that it is flying at greater efficiency. The strong euro has been blamed for holidaymakers putting off short trips 
abroad, but the summer season will be the real key measure for budget carriers.
British Airways, which made 500 people redundant recently, has its own set of operational problems. Merger talks 
with Iberia were widely reported to be stuck on several major issues, including the size of BA's pension deficit and a 
power vacuum at one of Iberia's major shareholders. The talks have dragged on since August last year.
Spring also appears to be the time for management changes with the chief executive of Aer Lingus, Dermot 
Mannion, resigning unexpectedly after the Irish flag carrier posted a 119m (GBP108m) pre-tax loss for 2008. 
easyJet chairman Colin Chandler also confirmed his July departure after a series of disagreements with founder Sir 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou. BT chairman Michael Rake has been appointed deputy chairman with independent non-
executive Sir David Michels becoming interim chairman.
There are few positive signs for airlines as the recession retains its icy grip on the sector. An uptick in passenger 
numbers would suggest green shoots as airlines are among the most sensitive to economic changes. But the lack 
of any upturn at the moment suggests that we are not yet out of the woods. The airlines have only taken part in the 
recent market rally to a limited extent. BA is still fairly priced at 160p (Fairly priced, 146p, 24 March 2009), easyJet 
remains a sell at 316p (Sell, 286p, 22 January 2009) as is Ryanair at 3.10 (Sell, 3.40, 6 February, 2009).

RESULT: One-off costs, falling ticket prices and weakening cargo transportation mean that the outlook for Aer 
Lingus is cloudy
Shares in Aer Lingus touched down to new lows after tumbling 15 per cent on the back of losses caused by 
exceptional charges and the cost of defending the takeover bid by Ryanair. Its management predicts that it will 
need to cut fares by at least 10 per cent this year in order to maintain passenger numbers, and warned that it won't 
meet its earlier profit targets for the year.
Aer Lingus posted exceptional costs of 141m, of which 118m related to its redundancy programme. The cost-cutting 
exercise should deliver around 52m of annual savings. The company also spent 6m fending off the takeover bid by 
Ryanair, which has now been kicked firmly into touch by the competition authorities.
Operationally, passengers haven't abondoned the airline altogether - ticket sales grew by 2.5 per cent to 1.15bn - 
but management said it will reduce its long haul fleet by one aircraft this year, and will also suspend some routes, 
cutting capacity by some 13.6 per cent (although short haul capacity will rise by 9.4 per cent in 2009). Cargo was 
the worst performing division and although sales were up 5.5 per cent to 50.3m, most of this was due to the fuel 
surcharge on cargo - in organic terms, yield declined by 8 per cent, while tonnage was down 3.1 per cent.
Management said it expects passenger numbers to grow "marginally" in the current year, although it added that the 
economic climate meant a more accurate prediction was impossible. Cargo is likely to fare badly again, with 
volumes predicted to fall by 30 per cent, which means a return to pre-tax profits will remain elusive - operating 
losses are expected to be larger than in 2008. Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion said the company 
recognised that it had to diversify away from its Ireland base on which it has become "over-dependent" and that its 
new presence at Gatwick was part of this process.
Brokers are currently updating their estimates.

More analysis of company results
Aer Lingus has delivered the losses this year that we predicted last September, but, when stripped of large 
exceptional costs, the results weren't so bad. The airline still has plenty of cash on its balance sheet and fuel costs 
are on the way down. But with the passenger and cargo outlook weak, we continue to see the shares as fairly 
priced.

ANALYSIS: The clouds are gathering over the aviation sector
Snow-bound passengers at Heathrow are unlikely to have felt much sympathy for the airlines struggling to catch up 
with delayed flights, but spare a thought for those executives responsible for setting airline fuel hedging policies. 
Get it wrong and the the costs can be punitive, as Ryanair has discovered.
The Irish budget carrier lost 102m (GBP91.4m) in the third quarter after what chief executive Michael O'Leary freely 
admitted was a "screwed up" oil price hedging policy. Ryanair resisted hedging for most of last year as oil prices 
rocketed towards $147 a barrel, exposing the company to the full cost of spot rates. But, after reported shareholder 
pressure, Mr O'Leary brought in fuel hedging just as the oil price collapsed. But
However, an unhedged fourth quarter without the distraction of the recently rejected takeover offer for Aer Lingus, 
prompted the airline to upgrade its full-year guidance from breakeven to a modest 50m to 80m profit. Ryanair is 
also poised to buy more aircraft from Boeing and Airbus at big discounts, as both companies look set to suffer hefty 
falls in orders this year.
Meanwhile, the economic environment for the industry continues to deteriorate. IATA figures for December show 
that air freight fell by a record 22.6 per cent, while passenger numbers in Europe and North America were down by 
2.7 per cent and 4.3 per cent, respectively.
Ryanair's shares are high enough at 3.06 as it is heavily exposed to a summer holiday season in which a weak 
pound and economic problems could force many travellers to stay at home.

Associated British Foods should say more about its new US joint venture, while British Airways needs to clarify its 
pension deficit
Tuesday 4 November
Associated British Foods (ABF) releases full-year results on Tuesday, and investors will be keen to see how high 
commodity prices and energy costs in the earlier part of the year affected earnings. The food and retail group has 
had healthy growth at its Primark clothing chain, but margins have not been improving and ABF should reveal how 
it plans to face the challenging consumer environment in the UK. The company has formed a joint venture with a 
US-based agricultural processor to make and sell vegetable oil in the US and Canada. More details on this should 
be forthcoming in the results. Broker Investec expects full-year pre-tax profits of GBP600m and EPS of 51p.
Friday 7 November
British Airways will release its second-quarter results on Friday. Investors will be looking to see how declining 
passenger figures and fuel costs have affected earnings. Any information on its pension scheme deficit would be 
helpful to clear concerns that the figure is larger than previously indicated. Updates on its planned merger with 
Iberia and the outlook for premium passenger traffic would also be useful. Broker Evolution Securities expects EPS 
of 12.9p for 2008 and pre-tax profits of GBP317m.

SUMMARY: Weak commodity stocks drag the Footsie down
Leading shares have relinquished early gains, and the FTSE100 index fell below the 5,500 level to stand 25.2 
points lower at 5,472.2. Much of the reversal reflects further weakness in mining stocks as base metal prices drop 
away. Mid-cap stocks are also out of favour, and the FTSE250 index was off 25 points at 9,110. Trading volume 
was especially weak however at just GBP690m.
Nickel dropped 2.6 per cent on the London Metal Exchange, FT.Com reports, while copper and zinc also fell. 
Meanwhile gold fell nearly 2 per cent, back below $800 an ounce. Resource stocks dominated the top 10 list of 
fallers on the benchmark index. Kazakhmys lost 5.2 per cent to GBP11.96. Vedanta Resources fell 4.7 per cent to 
GBP17.22. The sell off in the energy markets also resumed, pushing Nymex crude oil back below $114 a barrel. BG 
Group eased 1 per cent to GBP11.28, and BP remained flat at 527p.
But companies with high exposure to fuel costs were better off, and cruise operator Carnival rose 1.2 per cent to 
GBP19.39, while British Airways, which on Thursday announced plans to join forces with American Airlines and 
Iberia, added 2.1 per cent to 259p. Budget airline Easyjet climbed 2.6 per cent to 364p, while larger rival Ryanair 
jumped more than 4.8 per cent to 2.77.
Retailers had a rally following John Lewis' announcement of a 9.3 per cent increase in year on year weekly sales, 
for the week to August 9. Marks & Spencer was up 3.6 per cent to 275 1/4p and Next followed with a rise of 3.5 per 
cent to GBP10.38p.
One of the biggest factors in the commodity sell off was the rising dollar. The US currency rose 0.6 per cent to 
$1.8569 against the pound, taking sterling's losses in the past month to 7.8 per cent.
By the close of its GBP400m rights issue Bradford & Bingley shares were trading at 0.25p above the issue price of 
55p.
Michael Page, the recruitment agency, fell after it announced it was ending discussions and rejecting a GBP1.3bn 
unsolicited approach from Swiss rival Adecco. The Michael Page board said that Adecco's offer "materially 
undervalued" the company. The shares lost 6 per cent to 315p.

COMMENT: Despite the fillip of a possible BA/Iberia tie-up, the airlines remain deeply troubled
The past week could have marked yet another watershed for the struggling airline industry. As Lufthansa battled to 
contain the effects of a crippling strike and Ryanair was forced to eat a big slice of humble pie as it put a brave face 
on an 85 per cent decline in first-quarter profits, we also witnessed the first serious piece of airline consolidation 
news for four years with confirmation that British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia are in talks over a merger.
For BA and Iberia an agreed merger has been a long time coming and it is to be hugely welcomed. Assuming that 
negotiations complete, and that US and European regulators can be persuaded that this merger will not change the 
competitive landscape, it should be waived through. Meanwhile, in an industry dominated by fuel price concerns 
and the ever worsening economic fallout that is the natural aftermath of a doubling in the price of oil, the word 
consolidation is now writ large on the wall.
For an industry now in deep trouble, the BA/Iberia merger addresses but a small fraction of the overall problem. Up 
to now, consolidation calls have mainly fallen on deaf ears as have the shouts for fast-track capacity reduction. As 
in past crises, while some airlines have battened down the hatches and cut capacity, there remains a belief and 
hope within the industry that this crisis will finally sort the men from the boys, meaning that various airlines will go 
bust. But will investors and the stronger airlines actually get what they want? Much depends on how long the crisis 
of economic confidence lasts and chances are that, apart from laying up about 10 per cent of fleets during the 
winter months, most will manage to carry on with perhaps only a handful of smaller airlines going bust. 
Consolidation isn't always the best answer. While mergers may be welcomed by some, the reality is that they rarely 
do much to improve earnings potential. Air France-KLM may be an exception and the hope is that a merged 
BA/Iberia could eventually provide fruits but, leaving aside the longer-term potential for European/US airline 
mergers, there is limited scope for short-term consolidation beyond what we already have.
Will more airlines go bust? It is likely they will but not flag carrier/legacy airlines. While the best way to answer an 
overcapacity crisis means allowing airlines to go bust, look no further than the Italian government's continued 
propping up of the ailing Alitalia to see that this isn't such a simple idea.
Middle and Far East airlines apart, 2008 will mark a temporary ending to 'benefits' that the European and US airline 
industry may have enjoyed from the past 20-year phase of partial market liberalisation. The US airline industry is in 
a huge mess that makes European industry problems look like a stroll in the park. Yes, more jets will be laid up and 
Airlines running for cover
routes cut and it may be several years before the industry recovers to move on to a next natural stage in the growth 
process, but at least this crisis will mark in my view a significant change in market attitudes to the so-called 
economy or budget airlines and it may well bring about an abrupt end to 10 years of rapid expansion and further 
growth dreams.
Grabbing the headlines this week with its appalling set of quarterly numbers, one notes that Ryanair was quick to 
go out on the offensive claiming it will further cut fares in the hope that this will hasten the demise of competitors. If 
Ryanair intends to keep digging, the result could well be that all it will succeed in doing is digging its own grave. For 
shareholders' sake, I hope not. Ryanair needs to get real and accept that this deepening airline crisis will get worse 
before it eventually gets better and that, with little if any scope to cut costs, it must cover all its costs within the basic 
ticket price. That means climbing off the soap box and substantially raising fares and maybe even cutting capacity 
back by nearer 30 per cent.
Even the fast-growing Middle and Far East group of airlines will feel the pinch of this economic crisis to a greater 
extent than they currently are. For example, it seems that airline ticket sales in China have taken a big dip on the 
back of the sharp reduction in Chinese government oil price subsidy. The upcoming Olympic Games may provide a 
brief respite but, from an affordability point of view, everyone is affected by the increased price of fuel. Airlines need 
to remember that the overall cost of leisure and business travel is no longer as affordable as it was. An object 
lesson perhaps for Ryanair and many other airlines too in the months ahead.

TIP UPDATE: News of talks sends shares higher, but the company needs to seal the deal this time
- Talks commence on all-share merger
- Plan envisages unified board, but separate brand identities
- Major Iberia shareholder, Caja Madrid, could thwart deal with 23 per cent stake
Barely a day after Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary predicted that more European airlines would have to 
consolidate, British Airways and Iberia have confirmed a resumption of talks aimed at merging the two businesses. 
It's not the first time; BA was part of a Texas Pacific consortium that attempted to buy Iberia last year.
The combined group would have better scale, and BA would benefit from Iberia's strong position flying to and from 
Latin America, which is a growth market. Failure to seal a deal would see both airlines slip down the European 
pecking order; Air France has already merged with KLM, and thought about adding the tottering Alitalia, while 
Lufthansa owns Swiss International. In the US, Northwest and Delta intend to merge by the end of the year.
Any transaction would require regulatory approval, although it's unlikely that there would be any insurmountable 
objections. More delicate is the question of Caja Madrid, the Spanish bank that helped block the previous takeover 
of Iberia. It has since expanded its stake to 23 per cent, but this is a merger with another airline for operationally 
sound reasons, rather than a private-equity-led deal like the last proposal. BA itself owns 13 per cent of Iberia.

BA has held merger talks with American Airlines, KLM and Iberia over the years, but never put together a deal. It 
needs to break that losing streak this time. The shares are a long-standing buy tip, and although they've fallen a 
long way since 2006, there's little point giving up now. A merger deal plus lower oil prices could trigger a recovery.

As Ireland faces recession, Gartmore Irish Growth's manager turns to individual share bets
Fund manager Gervais Williams has made his reputation by investing in Irish companies. And until about 12 
months ago he could do no wrong as he benefited from the Celtic tiger's economic prosperity. But that prosperity is 
now in doubt - like the UK, Ireland faces recession. The upshot was that Ireland was one of the worst-performing 
stock markets in 2007 and has continued to perform poorly in so far this year. And because Gartmore Irish is a buy-
and-hold fund, Mr Gervais has to be fairly fully invested but has nowhere to go.
In fact, all he can do is make careful share selections. So, in the first quarter of 2008, he bet big on Anglo Irish 
Bank. This new holding accounted for a hefty 15 per cent of the portfolio at end-May 2008 and was partly funded 
through the sale of shares in Ryanair.

Poor first-quarter figures and it'll be breakeven at best for the full year
Budget airline Ryanair has reported its worst results in more than a decade. In the first quarter of its financial year to 
30 June, underlying net profits slumped 85 per cent from 139m to 21m, while the group recorded a headline pretax 
loss of 90.5m.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said he now expects results for the full year of "between breakeven and a loss of 
60m". Two key strategic decisions are in large part behind the group's worsening fortunes. One was a decision not 
to hedge fuel costs on the grounds that the oil price suffered from irrational exuberance, and it left the company fully 
exposed to a 93 per cent year-on-year increase in the cost of fuel. The decision has now been reversed, and it has 
begun to hedge for the early winter - but kerosene is now 50 per cent of Ryanair's operating costs, and all the 
annoying supplementary charges have failed to fully mitigate its impact.
The other was its attempt to buy Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus in 2007, which was thwarted by the European 
competition authorities. Ryanair's residual stake in Aer Lingus was written down by another 93.6m today.
Revenues did grow 12 per cent revenue growth and passenger numbers were up 19 per cent, a creditable 
performance given that the same period a year ago included Easter. It said it would continue to lower ticket prices 
and predicted a wave of airline collapses over the winter.
Ryanair shares fell 19 per cent to 2.61, and although its business model is resilient and its balance sheet strong, 
high oil prices and a worsening economic outlook mean they are unlikely to recover anytime soon. High enough.

SUMMARY: Fresh weakness in bank shares offset by higher mining stocks
Leading shares are just a little softer from Friday's levels, although losses in the FTSE100 index would be much 
greater but for a positive contribution from oil and mining shares. As it is, the Footsie was off 8.6 points at lunchtime 
at 5,344, while the less resource-stuffed FTSE250 index was down 57 points at 8,811. Trading volume on the first 
full day of the school holidays was weak at just GBP713m.
Banks drifted lower, FT.Com reports, after a poor showing for their peers on Asian markets overnight kept fears 
about the extent of subprime losses in the sector alive. Barclays lost 1.8 per cent to 350.3p, Lloyds TSB fell 1.5 per 
cent to 325 1/2p and Royal Bank of Scotland fell 1.6 per cent to 211 1/2p. HBOS was 5.2 per cent weaker at 
295.3p.
Wider financial stocks also suffered. Schroders, the fund manager, dipped 1.8 per cent to 952p and Man Group, the 
world's biggest-listed hedge fund, was 0.8 per cent weaker at 587p.
Worries about the outlook for consumer spending in the UK also lingered and hit stocks exposed to dwindling 
disposable incomes. Carnival, the cruise operator, fell 2.5 per cent to GBP17.93 and Marks & Spencer lost 2 per 
cent to 254 1/2p and fashion retailer Next lost 2.9 per cent to GBP10.04. Enterprise Inns was 0.9 per cent softer at 
315p.
Overall losses were kept in check by a more confident showing in the mining sector, in line with strong 
commoditiesd markets. BHP Billiton was 3 per cent higher at GBP15.99, Xstrata rose 2.6 per cent to GBP33.56 and 
Rio Tinto was up 1.9 per cent at GBP50.47.
Well-received interim numbers from Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, helped its shares to the upper end 
of the leaderboard, up 1.7 per cent at 605 1/2p.
Airlines were hit by a warning from Ryanair that it could suffer an underlying loss of up to 60m for the full year after 
it reported first quarter numbers, hit by soaring fuel costs and falling fares. Its shares lost 13.4 per cent to 2.80, and 
led the rest of the sector lower. British Airways was 5.1 per cent weaker at 234.3p and easyJet lost 6.6 per cent to 
313.3p.

OVERSEAS MARKETS:
Australian banking stocks tumbled on Monday after ANZ Banking Group said it would need to make provisions of 
A$1.2bn for the second half of the year, just three days after after the nation's top lender National Australia Bank 
announced A$830 million in credit-related losses. The banking sector led the S&P/ASX 200 index 1.6 per cent 
lower to 4,892.3, in contrast with major markets elsewhere in the region, which mainly edged higher, though gains 
were pared as the morning continued. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo had pared most of its gains as it opened for 
afternoon trading, up just 0.1 per cent at 13,346.90, after earlier climbing 0.5 per cent. In Hong Kong, shares made 
muted gains, recently trading 0.3 per cent higher at 22,813.21, while the index of mainland shares traded in Kong 
Kong gained 0.7 per cent to 12,501.82.
COMMODITIES:
Oil futures were less volatile after recent sharp losses, but near term sentiment remains bearish after the latest 
hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico caused minimum disruption, while evidence mounted that demand from the US is 
slowing. Suggestions that global demand is slowing also affected soft commodities, with losses in corn and 
soyabean futures also accelerated by favourable growing conditions in the US.

TIP UPDATE: Business is steady at easyJet, but winter will be tough
Stiff economic headwinds don't seem to have blown easyJet too far off course. Third quarter figures from the 
budget airline reinforced the widely-held view that its business model protects it from the structural problems 
ravaging the rest of the airline industry.
Revenues climbed 32 per cent, helped along by steady passenger growth and a 12 per cent increase in revenue 
per passenger. The introduction of a Ryanair-style GBP5 charge for hold bags was a major contributor to the 
increase - non-flight revenues grew by 124 per cent in total, and at GBP103m now account for 16 per cent of sales, 
up from 9 per cent a year ago.
But the company warned that winter would be tough, as high fuel costs continue to buffet the industry. It said that 
fuel costs increased by GBP185m this year, despite hedging, and that non-fuel costs such as airport charges were 
also adding to margin pressure. Even against this tightening cost-environment, the airline expects underlying pre-
tax profits of between GBP110m and GBP120m.
The market also welcomed news that easyJet was scaling back its immediate capacity expansion plans, to between 
4 and 6 per cent this winter - when we suggested selling the shares earlier this year2 May 2008 
http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/Tips/Sell/TipsOfTheWeek/article/20080501/b990b3ee-12b8-11dd-a42f-
0015171400aa/easyJe t-EZJ.jsp 2 May 2008) one of our main concerns was the rapid capacity expansion into a 
market that was weakening overall. The company also said that there was room for further schedule changes if 
routes became unprofitable, or when opportunities arose if other carriers were forced to cut capacity. "In the current 
environment, flexibility is vital," it said.
easyJet is the silver lining in the black cloud hanging over the airline industry, and the shares have climbed 18 per 
cent to 347p since our sell tip. But, by its own admission, it is not immune to the fundamental issues afflicting the 
wider economy so, despite news that it's keeping careful eye on capacity, we stick with our advice to sell.

SECTORS: The airline industry is being buffeted by tough conditions

monthly passengers in June, up 19.5 per cent to 4.1 million. More important, there was stability in its load factor, 
which is essentially the number of 'bums on seats' per aircraft, which rose marginally to 86.9 per cent.
But the figures could mark the last glimpse of blue sky for an industry already battered by gale force headwinds in 
the form of rising fuel costs and increasingly cash strapped travellers. Revelations that privately owned operator 
BMI may be operating empty flights to keep hold of its prized Heathrow landing spots suggest that life is suddenly 
getting tougher for smaller airlines.
Meanwhile, both British Airways and Ryanair have said that they will cut flights by more than usual this winter in an 
attempt to preserve profits. Ryanair plans to ground 10 per cent of its fleet, saying that it will carry a million less 
passengers on 14 per cent fewer weekly flights, as well as closing operations at seven European bases. BA 
expects to cut capacity by up to 5 per cent as fuel costs for the year are likely to hit $3bn, almost $1bn more than 
originally budgeted.
The picture is similar in most mature air markets. American Airlines, Alitalia and Qantas have all announced job 
cuts in the thousands as they seek to trim what many analysts view as bloated cost bases. The International Air 
Transport Association now estimates that high fuel costs will see the global airline industry lose an aggregate

The outlook for the global airline industry has deteriorated rapidly, thanks to soaring oil prices, and executives are 
warning that there is simply no more fat left to cut
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has dramatically revised its industry financial forecast for 2008, 
illustrating the dire straits airlines face. More than a dozen airlines have collapsed over the past six months, with the 
writing on the wall for dozens more if oil remains at current levels.
IATA director general Giovanni Bisignani says that the industry is now expected to report a combined loss of $2.3bn 
this year, well down from the profits of $4.5bn predicted in March. Those forecasts were based on an average oil 
price of $86 a barrel, while the new predictions are based on oil of $106.5 a barrel - and even that may end up 
optimistic, with Brent crude recently passing the $130 a barrel level.
According to Mr Bisignani, each $1 increase in the price of fuel sends airlines' collective costs $1.6bn higher. The 
industry's total fuel bill in 2008 is expected to be $176bn, $40bn more than 2006, and will account for 34 per cent of 
operating costs. At $135 a barrel, Mr Bisignani says losses for the year could widen to $6.1bn. Ryanair's results this 
week indicated much more difficult times if oil does not retreat. Even allowing for a 5 per cent increase in fares, 
Ryanair will just about break even with oil at $130 a barrel. Other airlines are not so fortunate; Ryanair has a 
relatively new and fuel-efficient fleet of aircraft and a streamlined cost base.
Last week, business-class carrier Silverjet was placed under administration after it was unable to draw down on an 
agreed $5m loan. Two other business-class carriers, MAXjet and Eos, have also grounded their fleets in the past 
six months. IATA says airlines have improved fuel efficiency by 19 per cent in the last six years and reduced non-
fuel unit costs by 18 per cent. "There is no fat left," says Mr Bisignani. "To survive this crisis, even more massive 
changes will be needed quickly."
Airlines face a predicament and are removing capacity to remain viable. Shares in Ryanair are high enough at 2.86 
(High enough, 3.13, 4 February 2008), while fellow budget airline easyJet remains a sell at 300p (Sell, 294p, 25 
April 2008). British Airways should benefit most from MAXjet and Silverjet's demise. On that basis, we maintain our 
buy recommendation at 237p (Buy, 414p, 15 September 2006).

RESULT: With oil at $130 a barrel, Ryanair warns it may only break even this year
These were record figures from Ryanair, but the budget airline warned that if oil remains around the $130 a barrel 
level, then it will wipe out this year's profits entirely - even with an expected 5 per cent increase in ticket prices.
Excluding 90m of exceptionals, pre-tax profit rose 17 per cent to 529m, as the airline grew traffic 20 per cent and 
added 30 new aircraft. Ancillary revenues from checked-in baggage and airport check-in rose 35 per cent, giving an 
indication of how Ryanair gets by without having to charge customers a fuel surcharge. Cost increases were 
tempered by grounding seven aircraft during the quieter winter months and chief executive Michael O'Leary says up 
to 20 aircraft - about 10 per cent of the total fleet - will be grounded this year.
Mr O'Leary says Ryanair's hedging programme insulated it from the worst of last year's rising oil prices. The airline 
has already cut costs and acquired more fuel efficient aircraft to help counter the rising fuel bill. When oil prices 
settle down, as he believes they will, Ryanair's earnings will rebound strongly, Mr O'Leary says.
Numis Securities has pencilled in adjusted EPS of 7A for 2009 (2008: 31.5A) based on oil at $120 a barrel.

tables.
Much hinges on the oil price and the fare increases Ryanair can push through. While the airline is well positioned 
for a recovery once oil prices fall, the shares have fallen by almost half so far this year, and look high enough for 
now.

One does it, they all follow
Airlines are again increasing their fuel surcharges after oil prices surged to new highs. Air France has announced a 
10 (GBP8) rise in its surcharge on intercontinental flights, following Lufthansa's lead last month, when it increased 
the surcharge on all flights.
Other flag carriers, including British Airways and Aer Lingus are expected to follow suit, while budget airlines 
easyJet and Ryanair are likely to compensate for higher fuel bills by increasing ticket and ancillary fees.
This is bad news for passengers, but airlines need to protect their margins. We remain cautious on the low-cost 
airlines in particular.

FREE TIP: Shares climb steeply - giving investors a chance to bail out of a fragile business model
Shares in Silverjet have recovered some of their recent losses on confirmation that the business-class airline is in 
talks that may lead to an offer. In a statement, the airline said it had noted the recent increase in its share price, 
which has risen 65 per cent from the year low of 12.25p it hit on 4 April. A year ago, the shares traded above 200p. 
News of the takeover talks come as smaller airlines find it increasingly difficult to make profits in the face of high 
fuel costs and an economic downturn.
MAXjet, another business-class only carrier, filed for bankruptcy protection in December, while a number of other 
airlines have also ceased operations. Although Silverjet sold a record 10,885 tickets in March, increasing its load 
factor to 65 per cent, the airline failed to generate an operating profit as had previously been expected. Silverjet 
offers business-class fares at up to 50 per cent cheaper than legacy airlines' business-class fares. The carrier 
introduced a second London-New York service and a London-Dubai service late last year, and was due to take 
delivery of two more aircraft in March after raising GBP22m through a GBP12m share placement and a GBP10m 
loan from TFB, a company owned by the Reubens brothers. Due to the fall in Silverjet's share price, TFB did not 
convert the loan into shares in February when the option arose.
GOODBODY STOCKBROKERS
(Not rated). There is massive pressure on all airlines, and carriers that are stretched financially are being hit 
particularly badly. On a one-year price performance, Ryanair is down 55 per cent and British Airways is down 57 
per cent, while the price of jet fuel is up 87 per cent. A lot of recently-formed carriers are going through horrendous 
times and in order to understand why some of these models are starting to break down you just have to look at 
these figures. Anyone who is getting involved in Silverjet needs to have a long-term horizon and very deep pockets.
DANIEL STEWART
Sell. We would use this as an opportunity to sell. If any prospective bidder is diligent on Silverjet we see a strong 
probability that they will decide not to bid. We cannot see Silverjet making profits at the current fares and if fares go 
up, load factors will go down. Shareholders will then be back where they started - wondering how long it will be 
before the company fails. Our model shows Silverjet with a net asset value of GBP9.8m as of 31 March 2008 -

equivalent to 15.2p per share. This figure is continually shrinking, though, as the losses mount and we would not 
use it as a guide to value. Target price is 0p.
<![CDATA[With the economic situation likely to get tougher and no end in sight to high jet fuel prices, Silverjet is 
likely to continue battling strong headwinds. So, with the shares trading at 20.75p, investors should cut their losses

BUDGET 2008: Alastair Darling's first Budget changed tack on green issues. Graeme Davies
The promises of the 'greenest' Budget yet fell flat, although changes to vehicle excise duty and the threat of 
legislation to outlaw free plastic bags meant plenty of lip service was paid to green issues. But there could be some 
tangible, and not very palatable, longer-term effects on the energy producers and airlines.
Once again, the government has reiterated its commitment to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and its 
desire to see London remain at the forefront of the global carbon business. The proposal for implementing Phase III 
of the EU ETS out to 2020, which the government supports, would be a major boon for the likes of Climate 
Exchange, which has a significant share of the European carbon trading market .
But the extension of the EU ETS could affect UK energy generators, who would have to buy all of their allowances 
at auction in the 2013-20 period. Until now, companies have received at least 90 per cent of their emissions permits 
for free. "The government is doing this to put upward pressure on wholesale prices, and thus make renewables and 
nuclear energy more viable," says Angelos Anastasiou, utilities analyst at Pali International. The changes will affect 
coal-fired generators such as Drax the most, and cause power companies to look for greater efficiencies.
The government will push ahead with plans to shift aviation taxation from the individual to the airline via a per-
aircraft levy, expected in November 2009. The Chancellor says he is increasing forecast revenues from this tax by 
about 10 per cent in the second full year of operation, which some analysts are interpreting as an increase in the 
rate of the duty. But the exact rates and allowances are still under discussion.
"It looks increasingly likely that the change to the regime is not going to be a revenue-netural change, but is going 
to increase the overall burden of taxation on the industry," says Douglas McNeill, an analyst at Blue Oar Securities. 
The move, coupled with the expected inclusion of airlines in the EU ETS by 2012, will affect carriers with older 
fleets and low load factors. That suggests Ryanair and easyJet, whose modern aircraft are usually at least three-
quarters full, should be less affected than legacy national carriers.

The airline is on track to meet this year's profit forecasts, but analysts are concerned about what lies beyond. 
Stephen Gunnion
It seems curious that easyJet's view of the current market, and its fortunes in a deteriorating environment, is at odds 
with that of Ryanair , which is predicting a slump in revenue if oil prices remain where they are. But the market 
believes Ryanair's side of the story.
In a trading statement, easyJet maintains its guidance of an improvement of around 20 per cent in profit before tax 
for the year to September, although it faces increased costs due to higher airport charges and crew costs. In the 
first quarter, the airline grew the number of passengers flying on its airplanes 12.4 per cent, while its load factor - 
which measures how full its aircrafts are - eased back almost a percentage point to 80.8 per cent as it added more 
routes and increased the number of its planes. Ancillary revenues surged 61.9 per cent, largely due to an increased 
fee of GBP3.99 for checking baggage into the hold.
However, a trading statement from Ryanair earlier in the week was less upbeat, painting a gloomy picture for next 
year if the UK and Europe slide into a recession and oil remains above $85 a barrel. Ryanair said that the European 
airline sector was facing a cyclical downturn and it would have to slash fares and yields in response to consumer 
uncertainty.
Numis Securities says while easyJet's statement is "broadly reassuring", investors should remain cautious due to 
limited visibility of airline bookings. In easyJet's case, the final 25-30 per cent of the revenue is booked in the last 
four weeks prior to departure and the airline is hugely operationally leveraged. An early Easter this year is also 
distorting booking patterns, and Numis believes that the demand environment could soon deteriorate.
Likewise, analysts at Collins Stewart are also cautious on easyJet due to the increased supply of aircraft in the 
short-haul market and a likely dip in consumer demand.
We suggested buying easyJet shares just over a year ago at 626p (2 Feb, 2007), and they've been as high as 
732p, before a descent since mid-year that has taken them to 441p now. We still think easyJet is a solidly-managed 
business. However, given the current outlook - rising costs, coupled with stagnant or falling consumer spending - 
the shares are no more than fairly priced.

The FTSE 100 may have perked up, but it's more doom and more gloom in some sectors Algy Hall
The recent resurgence of the FTSE 100 has provided some grounds for recovery hopes. But as usual, it's been 
driven by oil and mining. Dig a little deeper, and the performance of certain sectors just keeps getting worse.
Let's start with real estate. Just when it looked like the sector may be rebounding after an abysmal 2007, worries 
have come to the fore about the robustness of rents. Property consultancy Knight Frank now expects a fall in City 
office effective rents (that's the rent paid by tenants after accounting for the incentives used to lure them into a 
building) this year. And trouble in the rental market could prompt another downward leg for property stocks.
Knight Frank also noted a 5 per cent drop in the amount of space under construction in the City in the final quarter 
of last year, which suggests there could be trouble ahead for the construction sector, too. To date, big construction 
firms, such as Balfour Beatty, have answered falling share prices with news of robust trading. However, economics 
consultancy Capital Economics is forecasting that "the sector will cool considerably in the months to come" after the 
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) reported that order expectations were at a nine year low in 
January.
And perhaps the most vocal industry-specific warning of the week came from Ryanair chief executive, Michael 
O'Leary. Never one to mince words, Mr O'Leary warned of a "perfect storm" that threatened to halve the airline's 
profits as it was dragged into a recession-induced price war. The dire predictions also gave Mr O'Leary the chance 
to take a swipe at the increased cost of landing slots that have been allowed by the Civil Aviation Authority, but, 
nevertheless, this was a stark warning of dark clouds forming.
All in all, evidence from vulnerable sectors such as real estate, construction and travel suggests that the problems 
that began last summer in the credit market look set to spread further and deeper. As the market continues to take 
a dim view of prospects in such sectors, any attempt to value companies on the basis of even very recent trading 
updates could come badly unstuck.

Shares in Ryanair fell 13 per cent after the airline warned that the slowdown in consumer spending and high fuel 
costs could halve next year's profits. Stephen Gunnion
Third-quarter results from <a href="http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/news.php?yr=08&month=feb&story=reg-en-
040208">Ryanair show that budget airlines are not immune to the economic downturn, with profit fa<a href="           
http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/news.php?yr=08&month=feb&story=reg-en-040208
lling for the first time in over a year. A slowdown in consumer spending and higher fuel costs are likely to lead to 
lower profits next year as well, the company warned. In response, the airline's shares fell by 13 per cent.
Despite a 21 per cent increase in the number of passengers flying with the Ryanair in 2007 - and a 16 per cent rise 
in year-on-year revenue to 569m (GBP426m) - adjusted profit after tax fell 27 per cent to 35m, although the airline 
described it as "a creditable performance in very adverse market conditions".
Excluding fuel hedges, unit costs rose 6 per cent during the three months to December due to higher airport 
charges at Stansted and Dublin airports. Ryanair still expects to achieve net profit growth of 17.5 per cent to 470m 
for the full year, but the outlook for next year is poor if oil remains at current levels and the UK and Europe slide into 
a recession, leading to slack consumer demand. Profits could fall as much as 50 per cent to 235m, the company 
said. But, due to its low cost base, it said that it would continue to be "substantially profitable" even in a recession.
Numis Securities remains cautious on the consumer outlook and is concerned about the likely deterioration in the 
yield outlook for airlines such as easyJet.
While budget airlines were expected to benefit from passengers switching down from more expensive flag carriers, 
it now appears that they too will feel the pinch as consumer spending slows. So, while oil remains around the $90 a 
barrel level, shares in Ryanair look high enough at 3.13.

"e-teeth" is big news for 1st Dental Nigel Bolitho
Slowly, almost painfully slowly, 1st Dental is inching back to profitability, thus justifying our "speculative buy" 
recommendation. In 2005 and 2006, profits were adversely affected by problems relating to new NHS contracts and 
the integration of a major acquisition. And the improvement in trading since 2006 isn't immediately obvious from the 
accompanying table. Perhaps of more significance is the company's pruning of net debt from GBP1.95m to 
GBP1.19m.
Over recent years, a great many dentists have abandoned the NHS in favour of a fully private practice. It is clear 
that 1st Dental's most important project is "e-teeth" - an online dental products portal aimed at professionals within 
the industry. In financial terms, the numbers are still small, with crowns and bridges the most popular products. But 
this "Ryanair of teeth" is achieving month-on-month sales increases of 25 per cent. The new-found confidence 
generated by this product may bring 1st Dental back to the takeover market, while a lower-risk option - franchising - 
is also being investigated.
For 2007-08, expect sales at GBP12m and a small but decent profit (thanks to reduced e-teeth set-up costs), and 
no automatic goodwill amortisation (last year's charge was GBP425,000).

A preview of announcements from BP, BHP Billiton and BSkyB, plus all the main events for the week commencing 
Monday 4 February. Stephen Gunnion
Tuesday 5 February
In a busy reporting week for resources stocks, investors have already factored a higher fourth-quarter tax rate and a 
poor quarter for BP's US downstream business, due to deteriorating refining margins, into the group's results for the 
year to 31 December. However, an internal restructuring is expected to start gaining momentum this year, which 
could lead to a re-rating of the stock, says broker Evolution Securities, which expects EPS of 48p.
Wednesday 6 February
On Wednesday, mining giant BHP Billiton reports back for the six months to December. However, the market is 
likely to be more interested in a possible formal bid for Anglo-Australian rival Rio Tinto, as Wednesday is also the 
deadline for an offer. The money is still on a revised offer with Rio's shares currently trading around 7 per cent 
higher than the implied value of the three-for-one indicative all-share offer made by Billiton late last year, which was 
rejected by Rio's board. Landsbanki expects full-year EPS of 133p.
Also on Wednesday, half-year results from satellite broadcaster BSkyB may be overshadowed by news that it must 
reduce its stake in terrestrial TV broadcaster ITV from 17.9 per cent to 7.5 per cent. At ITV's current share price, 
BSkyB will incur a GBP300m hit on its investment as ITV's share price has fallen significantly since BSkyB bought 
the stake for GBP940m in November 2006. Investors will want to know how and when the shares will have to be 
offloaded. Numis Securities expects full-year EPS of 25.7p.

Shares in easyJet lose altitude after the budget airline reports a lower load factor for December. Stephen Gunnion
Shares in easyJet slumped 11 per cent after December passenger statistics from the budget airline disappointed 
the market. Despite a 9.9 per cent rise in passenger numbers to 2.9 million - following a 13 per cent increase in 
capacity as it added new routes - the load factor, or percentage of seats filled, fell 2.2 percentage points.
Combine this with the impact of rising oil prices, and you can see why some analysts are now questioning the 
dilution this is likely to have on ticket yields. And although the airline will benefit this year from the additional 
baggage charges it is levying on customers, these charges may, in fact, be deterring some passengers from flying 
with easyJet, according to one analyst. However, easyJet's baggage handling fees are still lower than those at 
larger rival Ryanair.
At 475p, easyJet's shares are now trading below our buy tip (626p, 2 Feb 2007). However, the conditions affecting 
the airline are hurting the rest of the industry as well. We believe easyJet is better placed to weather these 
conditions than most other airlines, and retain our buy recommendation.

Ever wondered how Ryanair can beat profit forecasts while flying people to Europe for 99p? Here's how... Stephen 
Gunnion
As we point out in our <a title="main feature" href="/MarketsAndSectors/Sectors/article/20071128/5ab43644-86f3-
11dc-99d7-00144f2af8e8/Budget-airlines-reach-for-the-ski es.jsp">main feature</a>, budget airlines have enjoyed 
phenomenal growth over the past decade. But how can they make money from such low fares?
While commercial aviation took off in the 1920s, cheap flight was pioneered by US low-fare airline Southwest 
Airlines back in 1971, when it discarded complimentary peanuts, free drinks and meals, giving passengers cheap 
travel instead. In 1994, it introduced ticketless travel. Today, Southwest is the largest airline in the US by number of 
passengers carried domestically and the third largest airline in the world by number of passengers carried. It is also 
one of the world's most profitable airlines. Ryanair was modelled along the same lines and is today Europe's largest 
budget airline.
But how do these low-cost airlines do it? The fuel alone must cost more than the GBP20 or less (plus taxes) some 
airlines charge for a short-haul flight. However, in many instances they make most of their profits from charging for 
baggage, priority seating, refreshments on board the aircraft and on-board sales of duty-free products such as 
jewellery and perfumes. Airlines like easyJet are also dependent on other ancillary revenues, for example 
insurance, car hire and hotels.
The growth of internet booking has helped to keep costs down for customers, too, cutting out agents' commissions.
<p Ref="/assets/CMSlibrary/Images/DerivedPhotos/Ryanair_Plane_050607--450x270.jpg
No jetways, no boarding cards - all saving money
Also, not everyone pays the same price for their seats. While customers are drawn in by eye-catching prices of as 
little a GBP1 a seat, there is usually a very short window of opportunity to get bargains like these. The cheaper 
seats are usually limited in numbers and available for inconvenient times on mid-week, out-of-season flights. These 
cheap tickets are subsidised by the sale of more expensive, last-minute tickets.
How budget airlines work
To save on landing fees, many of these low-cost airlines land at airports outside of the cities they service, for 
example Stansted and Luton airports outside London, and Charleroi outside Brussels, so often what travellers save 
on the cheap tickets they pay for with expensive rail or coach connections.
Volume is also an important factor. According to easyJet's 2006 annual report, the average fare charged by the 
airline last year was GBP45.17p, while the average cost per seat was GBP41.85. That means the profit per 
passenger was just GBP3.32, which is a pretty thin margin considering it includes ancillary revenue from services 
such as on-board refreshments and priority seating. However, with the airline expected to carry 38m passengers in 
2007, it will turn a large profit.

Although there may be some headwinds ahead, the skies remain mostly clear for the burgeoning budget airline 
market - and there's hope for legacy carriers, too Stephen Gunnion
A year ago, some were predicting that Europe's low-cost airline market had reached its full potential, with more 
growth unlikely. With an abundance of operators and too many seats available, no-frills airlines could only expect to 
cannibalise the market share of other airlines, said one prominent business magazine.
Yet the figures tell a different story. In September, budget airlines offered 58m seats on more than 392,000 flights, 
up from 47m seats on 326,000 flights in the same month a year earlier, according to statistics provided by global 
aviation

and 
data

<a 
href="http://www.oag.com/oagcorporate/pressreleases/07+Growth+in+low+cost+sector+continues+to+soar+19090
7.html" target="_blank">Official Airline Guide</a> (OAG).
In fact, budget, or low-cost airlines, now account for 20 per cent of all seats on sale worldwide, up from 17 per cent 
a year ago. Twice as many people are flying on budget airlines today than four years ago, or, in other words, the 
capacity of budget airlines has more than doubled in four years.
In Europe, the figures are even higher, with low-cost flights accounting for 22 per cent of total flight activity and 30 
per cent of all available seats in the region, six percentage points higher than last year, OAG says. Low-cost 
carriers offered 133,000 flights and 21.8m seats in the region in September. Today, Ryanair carries more 
passengers in Europe each month than British Airways.
"In a single decade, low-cost carriers have transformed the European aviation scene beyond recognition," OAG 
says.
And while low-cost carriers are growing their market share by undercutting the full-service airlines, they are still 
turning a tidy profit. easyJet, one of Europe's biggest budget airlines, grew passenger numbers 13 per cent in the 
year to September, boosted by strong growth in flights to Italy and Spain. And profits grew almost 50 per cent 
despite rising fuel costs and increasingly cash-strapped customers due to rising interest rates.
Can the growth go on?
Budget airlines reach for the skies
So, where is all this growth coming from and how much is due to cannibalisation of legacy carriers? Although some 
of the market share has been taken from existing carriers, Duncan Alexander, MD for OAG Business Development, 
says much of it is new growth.
New routes have been opened that were previously not available and previously underutilised regional airports 
have been popularised, says Mr Alexander.
And the increase in EU members by an additional 10 nations since 2004 has also helped fuel growth as EU 
membership leads to deregulation of markets, creating fertile ground for budget airlines to grow in.

target="_blank">Civil Aviation Authority</a> last year show that capacity growth in the industry has been broadly 
unchanged over the past 20 years, with passenger traffic between the UK and Europe growing at an average 5.5 
per cent since 1986. While the growth rate of low-cost airlines has been much higher, this has been at the expense 
of charter and full-service airlines.
easyJet communications director Toby Nicol says his airline has a stated objective of growing at 15 per cent a year 
over the next few years. However, with the UK market nearing saturation, much of that growth will come from 
Europe.
About two-thirds of easyJet's business involves the UK - with flights either departing from or arriving in the UK. Just 
one-third of flights have arrival and departure points in mainland Europe. Mr Nicol says this means large growth 
opportunities remain for easyJet on the continent. The airline already has established bases in Madrid and Milan 
and will focus on growing flight activity eastwards and southwards, he says.
"The UK is more or less at maturity. That doesn't mean no growth, but the days of rapid expansion in the UK are 
behind us," he says.
easyJet is just one airline targeting the growth opportunities on the continent. OAG has identified 40 low-cost 
carriers throughout Europe, with many expanding away from their traditional home bases. Air Berlin has a growing 
Spanish network and easyJet and Ryanair have established dominant positions by opening bases throughout 
Europe.
Apart from the two largest players, Ryanair and easyJet - both of which are listed - other UK-based low-cost airlines 
include BMI's bmibaby, Flybe, jet2 and Flyglobespan. OAG says Monarch Scheduled and Thompsonfly, both spun 
out of charter airlines, are also growing quickly. Spain's clickair also shows promise, while outside Europe low-cost 
Asian carrier AirAsia is making its presence felt in the Far East.
Everyone's low-cost now.
Although many of the full-service airlines and many of the foreign carriers have been forced to adapt their business 
models - in some cases, selling tickets as cheaply from Heathrow as the low-cost carriers do from the UK's 
secondary airports - this has not impeded the growth of budget airlines, says OAG. However, not all will be 
successful. Many start-up low-cost airlines have failed to make it off the runway.
According to broker Collins Stewart, the low-cost, short-haul segment of the market is the toughest to be in at the 
moment. This is largely due to extensive pockets of capacity and, in some places, overcapacity.
"This has been self-inflicted by both easyJet and Ryanair," Collins Stewart says. However, the broker expects both 
airlines to continue growing capacity at 20 per cent, against demand growth of around 18 per cent.
But, the differentiators between legacy and low-cost airlines are becoming increasingly blurred, with all airlines 
continually looking at their cost base. As recently as five years ago, Aer Lingus still provided a hot breakfast on its 
flights from Ireland to the UK. But the Irish airline is now becoming more like its main competitor, Ryanair, on short-
haul routes, Mr Alexander says.

"A lot of the basic premises of low-cost airlines are having to be adopted by the incumbents," says Mr Alexander.
And while traditional airlines feel pressure from low-cost carriers at the bottom end of the market, the emergence of 
niche, business-only carriers is increasing competition at the top end.
While the low-cost model is very much predicated on secondary airports, single fleets of aircraft and fast turnaround 
times, the business-only carriers offer chauffeur services to collect customers, convenient airports and all the 
luxuries business travellers expect for a reduced rate.
OAG says it is unlikely that the full-service model will survive on routes within short-haul Europe in the long term. 
And with low-cost airlines muscling in on the leisure market, some legacy carriers like British Airways are focusing 
on the long-haul, premium market, where they can add value for travellers. British Airways has been reconfiguring 
its aircraft to include more business class and premium economy seats.
Business opportunity
However, OAG says there is also a move by business travellers to fly with budget airlines, although the lack of 
flexibility means a high no-show factor.
According to the Barclaycard Business Travel Survey for 2005-06, British Airways remains the most popular airline 
for business travellers, while easyJet remains number one for low-cost business travel. However, the survey shows 
stagnant growth for the low-cost business travel market.
easyJet's Mr Nicol says about 20 per cent of its customers are business passengers. And it is focused on growing 
this market.
easyJet fares better than Ryanair when it comes to business passengers because, in most cases, it lands in the 
major airports in its destination cities, while many of the airports Ryanair lands at are far from city centres. This puts 
easyJet in a stronger position to take business passengers from legacy airlines.
The fact that Ryanair and some other low-cost airlines use airports that are not central to the cities they serve has 
drawn some criticism.
OAG says Ryanair in particular has been criticised for describing Charleroi in Belgium as Brussels and Gerona in 
Spain as Barcelona, while Stockholm Skavsta is actually 88km from Stockholm itself and Frankfurt Hahn is 120km 
from Germany's financial centre.
They have also been censured for misleading advertising and poor levels of customer service. And several low-cost 
carriers have collapsed leaving passengers with no financial protection, says OAG. Although, in fairness, the same 
has happened with full-service scheduled airlines.
OAG says it seems inevitable that the growth rates of recent years will slow down, except in central and eastern 
Europe, where there is still untapped potential.
"The larger low-cost carriers have proved they can attract a totally new market while eating into the market share of 
legacy airlines and tour operators, but some consolidation is likely at the expense of smaller operators," OAG says.
But, so long as it remains cheaper for someone in the north of England to fly to Europe for the weekend than to take 
a train to London, low-cost carriers will continue to flourish.
"There doesn't seem to be any slowdown in the number of passengers flying," says Mr Alexander. "The current 
airlines seem able to make new markets and, if the market is not growing, they are very quick to pull the route and 
move their fleets."
Budget airlines reach for the skies
However, full-service airlines are not under threat on their long-haul routes as budget airlines are likely to remain 
focused on short-haul destinations where they can keep costs low. Airlines like British Airways will succeed with 
short-haul flights that fly into Heathrow and feed into its transatlantic and other long-haul flights.

British Airways and others have hiked surcharges, but low-cost carriers are finding other ways to pass on the rising 
cost of fuel Stephen Gunnion
Airline passengers have become the latest victims of the rampant oil price, with many flag carriers announcing 
increases in fuel surcharges this week. British Airways will increase the surcharge for longhaul flights of under nine 
hours by GBP10 to GBP48 each way, while the surcharge on flights of more than nine hours will increase by 
GBP15 to GBP58 each way. Aer Lingus, Air France and Lufthansa have also increased fuel surcharges.
However, low-cost airlines Ryanair and easyJet are sticking to their guns, saying they won't introduce fuel 
surcharges for passengers, relying rather on their higher load factors to compensate for rising fuel costs. They have 
also criticised the flag carriers for imposing fuel surcharges when they have hedged against the oil price. But British 
Airways says only a percentage of its fuel is hedged forward.
Collins Stewart transport analyst Andrew Fitchie says although most airlines have hedged against the oil price, this 
only defers the inevitable and they have to get their pricing strategies in place to offset rising fuel prices. On 
average, the surcharge only covers about 60-70 per cent of the oil price increase, he says. Mr Fitchie says low-cost 
carriers compete against the total cost of legacy carriers, including their fuel surcharges. So, when other airlines 
increase their fuel surcharges, low-cost carriers also manage their yield up. These budget airlines have also been 
aggressive in implementing additional costs, including charges for baggage and priority boarding, which most 
legacy carriers don't charge for.
According to ABN AMRO, easyJet is shielded to an extent from rising oil prices by the weakening dollar, as it incurs 
about a third of its operating costs - plus almost all its capital expenditure - in dollars, but has no dollar revenues.
Airlines are not alone in feeling the pain of oil prices threatening $100 a barrel. Other transport groups and hauliers 
are affected as well. Mr Fitchie says they are also likely to increase fares where they can.
While rising oil prices spell bad news for transport companies, earnings are unlikely to be unduly affected as they 
are absorbed or passed onto customers. On that basis, we remain positive on both British Airways (buy, 414p, 15 
September 2006) and easyJet (buy, 626p, 2 February 2007). Buy.

Full-year revenue at the low cost carrier will be boosted by better winter yields, costs savings and an early Easter 
next year. Stephen Gunnion
Ryanair plans to open four new bases this winter, including Bristol, Belfast and Alicante and Valencia in Spain. And 
the low cost airline will start 130 new routes across Europe. Other new routes and bases performed well over the 
summer, contributing to a 23 per cent rise in profit for the six months to September.
However, with ticket prices easing back, ancillary sales - the revenue Ryanair earns from car rentals, hotel 
bookings, travel insurance, onboard sales and excess baggage revenues - helped drive the strong growth in profits. 
Ancillary sales rose 54 per cent to 252m and chief executive Michael O'Leary says the airline is making steady 
progress in growing these to 20 per cent of total revenues.
A rise in airport charges at London's Stansted airport and higher oil prices led to a 5 per cent rise in unit costs in the 
six-month period. However, Ryanair has cut the number of aircraft using Stansted by 20 per cent. Mr O'Leary says 
this will bring more stability to winter yields and cut operating costs. So, the company now expects full-year net 
profit of about 470m, around 30m higher than previously forecast, assisted by an early Easter next year.
Brokers Davy forecasts full-year EPS of 31A, rising to 33A in 2009.

High oil prices continue to be an Achilles heel, but Ryanair is clearly benefiting from aggressive expansion and add-
ons like ancillary sales. Trading on a prospective earnings multiple of 18 for next year, the shares look fairly priced

Passenger numbers have almost doubled in six months, but the business-only carrier's load factor has room to 
improve. Stephen Gunnion
Business-only airline Silverjet has almost doubled its capacity since May, assisted by the addition of a second New 
York service in September. So it's no surprise that the business-only airline reported record passenger numbers for 
October, with 6,782 passengers paying to fly on the carrier.
Silverjet now has two services a day from Luton to Newark, a New Jersey airport that's a less stressful alternative to 
the hectic JFK, and closer to Wall Street. However, the airline's load factor is subdued at just 58.5 per cent - 
meaning its planes are, on average, almost half empty. That's nice for passengers, but not for shareholders. 
EasyJet and Ryanair typically boast load factors in the high eighties.
Chief executive Lawrence Hunt says he's confident this will improve as the second service becomes more 
established. A service to Dubai is due to start on November 18, and Mr Hunt says forward bookings are 
encouraging so far. The airline plans to buy a further two aircraft next May. Possible new routes include Delhi, 
Mumbai, Johannesburg, Los Angeles and Chicago.
Each time a new route is added, Silverjet's load factor - and earnings - will be temporarily diluted. However, as a 
growth story, the airline remains long-term good value at 81p.

Ryanair will announce its interim results on Monday and it will be interesting to see whether Europe's largest 
international airline has managed to maintain the strong performance seen in its first quarter results. Back in July, 
the company reported record profits for the three months to end-June, 18 per cent growth in passenger numbers 
and a 22 per cent increase in revenues. At the time, the board upgraded its guidance for profits for the financial 
year although it also cautioned that yields could come under pressure in the second quarter. And with the oil price 
hitting record highs recently, adding upward pressures on costs, investors will be paying close attention to the 
outlook for the remainder of the year. ABN Amro expects that revenue will rise to 2,675m for full-year 2008 and has 
raised its forecast EPS estimate by 4 per cent to 0.32.
Tuesday 6 November
On Tuesday, Marks & Spencer will report interims results for the six months to end-September and although they

the financial year which showed that UK sales had increased 6.4 per cent in total and 2.0 per cent on a like-for-like 
basis. This performance was achieved against strong prior year comparatives and was driven by strong growth in 
food sales and market share gains. At the time, chief executive Stuart Rose was comfortable that M&S would

2008.
Wednesday 7 November
Half-year results due today from diversified miner Vedanta Resources should be in line with expectations following

The low-cost carrier prepares to swoop on Alitalia's slots at Milan's Malpensa airport. Stephen Gunnion
Ever the opportunist, Ryanair is taking advantage of Alitalia's plan to reduce flights at Milan's Malpensa airport by 
adding 50 more routes and stationing 12 more aircraft at the airport. A further 30 routes will be added at nearby 
Bergamo airport.
The low-cost carrier says it will double the size of its existing Bergamo base, adding six more aircraft and 39 
additional routes at a cost of $420m (GBP207m) over the next five years. Its investment in Malpensa will be twice 
that at $840m, as it adds five new aircraft next year, a further four in 2009 and three in 2010. Apart from the 50 new 
international routes, it also plans 10 domestic low fare routes.
Alitalia, the loss-making Italian flag carrier, plans to cut up to 140 flights to Malpensa and transfer its commercial 
traffic to Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport in an attempt to return to profitability. EasyJet, another low-cost carrier, 
is also reported to have expressed interest in Alitalia's takeoff and landing slots at Malpensa.
The additional Milan routes add to Ryanair's strong growth prospects going forward. However, its shorter-term 
outlook was cautious when it released a first quarter trading update last month, so we still think the shares are fairly 
priced at 524 euro cents.

Profits at the airline lose altitude owing to dearer fuel and the cost of fighting off Ryanair's unsolicited advances 
Stephen Gunnion
Aer Lingus' first half results fwere a mixed bag, with rising expenses and the cost of fighting Ryanair's hostile 
takeover taking the shine off of otherwise positive numbers and good prospects.
A 28 per cent rise in the airline's fuel bill has been felt a bit more keenly than usual, as Aer Lingus makes most of its 
profits in the second half of the year, when the costs are easier to recover. Add to that the 7.8m it forked out to 
defend itself against Ryanair's unsolicited advances, and you'll see why underlying profit before tax was down 8 per 
cent at 11.5m.
There has been a softening in load factors, too, although the airline says this is partly due to increased capacity as 
it puts more planes in the air. For instance, Aer Lingus has a number of new routes coming into operation, including 
those under the new Open Skies policy between the EU and the US. A new base at Belfast International Airport - its 
first outside the Republic of Ireland - will service eight routes from December.
Additional costs in the second half will include 3.5m in lost bookings and contingency costs it will still incur despite 
managing to avert a two-day strike by its pilots.
At 2.47, the shares are down slightly on our sell tip (2.56, 13 July 2007). And although prospects are improving, Aer 
Lingus is still relatively expensive on a prospective PE ratio of 14 for 2008. High enough for now.

First-quarter profits from Ryanair grew 20 per cent year-on-year to 139m (GBP93.7m) on the back of an 18 per cent

hire, travel insurance, onboard sales and excess baggage revenues.

Dart's low-cost airline Jet2.com performed well last year, but the outlook is more turbulent. Kirsty Green
The outlook for low-cost airlines has darkened recently with both Ryanair and easyJet warning that fierce 
competition is putting fares under pressure. So although Dart's low-cost carrier Jet2.com, which flies from six 
airports in the North of England to continental Europe, performed well last year, the company says that profits are 
unlikely to grow this year.
Nevertheless, Dart remains committed to Jet2.com; five new planes were purchased last year, taking the owned 
fleet to 29, and the company sees good potential for new Canary Islands routes, which have up to now been served 
primarily by charter operators.
Meanwhile, Dart's logistics business, Fowler-Welch Coolchain, which handles chilled and non-chilled produce for 
supermarkets and food manufacturers, continues to make good progress. New business wins were encouraging, 
and Dart boosted its presence with the acquisition of a smaller rival in April last year and a new 40,000 square foot 
freehold facility in Tyne and Wear, which it hopes will be a platform for growth in the North East. Dart says that 
further logistics acquisitions are possible this year.
Collins Stewart expects adjusted pre-tax profit of GBP16.6m, giving EPS of 8.1p for the current year (2006/07: 
GBP16.6m, 8.7p).

easyJet said its profit growth guidance for the full year remains unchanged at 40-50 per cent. It expects total 
revenue per seat to decline by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent, but this will be offset by increased cost 
reductions, reflecting improvements in the cost of aircraft ownership, careful management of airport related costs 
and a reduction in overheads. For May, passenger traffic was up 13 per cent at 3.35m and the load factor was

EasyJet has been battered by signs of a tougher trading environment, but the share price fall looks overdone Kirsty 
Green
EasyJet's shares have lost altitude sharply over the past month, falling from over 700p at the start of May to around 
525p now, as it has become clear that this year will be tougher for the airline industry. Now, though, the group is 
saying that while fares will fall, so will costs - so profit guidance remains unchanged.
Commentary accompanying its May traffic figures confirmed that fares have come under pressure, with total 
revenue per seat expected to fall by 5 to 10 per cent year-on-year in the second half. But costs per seat are also 
expected to fall by more than 5 per cent. The net result is that easyJet's guidance for a 40 to 50 per cent increase in 
pre-tax profits this year remains unchanged.
That's in contrast to rival Ryanair, which said earlier this week that its non-fuel costs would rise later this year, 
largely because of higher airport charges, and that its profits would grow by only around 5 per cent as a 
consequence.
So, looking back now, it would have been a shrewd move to book profits from our recent easyJet buy tip (626p, <a 
title="2 February 2007" href="/Tips/Buy/TipsOfTheWeek/article/20070202/54be0b08-e8ff-11db-9f1b-00144f2af 
8e8/EASYJET-EZJ.jsp 2 February 2007</a>) when the shares were well north of 700p. But everything's easy with 
hindsight, so the question now is whether the sell-off has been an overreaction. It's clear that, unlike last year, 
easyJet won't get the benefit of big fare increases. Nevertheless, its cost cutting efforts, growth in ancillary 
revenues such as car hire, and a more stable oil price, mean that it's still going to grow profits significantly.
Negative sentiment is likely to plague easyJet shares whilst the market adjusts to the more normal operating 
conditions for airlines this year. But for investors with a longer-term view, this could present a buying opportunity. 
The shares are trading on 13 times 2007/08 estimates - which looks too cheap for 40 to 50 per cent profit growth, 
so we reiterate our earlier buy advice.

Ryanair is fastening its seatbelt for leaner times ahead. Kirsty Green
Ryanair has been flying high over the past year. Passenger numbers rose by 22 per cent to 42.5m and it was able 
to increase its average fare by 7 per cent, thanks to rivals raising their ticket prices and fuel surcharges. So net 
profit soared 33 per cent to 401m, which was a record for Ryanair and 11m more than its previous guidance had 
suggested.
But there are clouds on the horizon. Chief executive Michael O'Leary says that trading conditions have "softened" 
recently. "We are responding in the only way we know how and that is starting a fares war," he says. Mr O'Leary 
hopes that, as Ryanair is the lowest-cost operator, then it will win that war.
With ticket prices under pressure, Ryanair is now forecasting a 5 per cent drop in average fares this year, although 
passenger growth is still expected to remain solid. Fuel costs should be 10 per cent lower, but other costs are 
rising. So, overall, Ryanair is expecting net profits to grow by 5 per cent this year.
Citigroup currently forecasts EPS of 32c for 2008, but the broker points out that Ryanair's new lower guidance 
would imply EPS of only 28c.
Although Ryanair is still a good medium-term growth story, it looks as if the softer conditions will persist for the 
foreseeable future and that will weigh on the shares. Fairly priced for now.

A fleet of airline start-ups is taking to the skies, just as the industry seems to be entering a tougher period Kirsty 
Green
The next big battle for the skies is shaping up to take place over the Atlantic. Last week, Richard Branson unveiled 
plans for a new business class-only transatlantic airline. He hopes to get the new airline, flying under the Virgin flag 
from European cities to the US, off the ground in the next 18 months. But his is just one of a new breed of airline 
start-ups that have their sights on juicy transatlantic routes.
In fact, no fewer than three business class-only transatlantic airlines have taken to the skies in the past 18 months. 
US-based Eos launched a luxury business class service between London and New York in October 2005. A month 
later, Maxjet, which is planning an Aim float this month, started a low-fare transatlantic business class service. Then 
in January, UK-based Silverjet, which floated on Aim in May 2006, launched a low-fare business class service 
between Luton and New York.
So far, though, there's been no discernible impact on British Airways' (BA) business class product. That's probably 
because BA is protected by its preferred carrier deals with companies, which mean that many business travellers 
have to use BA. And, while the new business-only airlines have reported good passenger growth, the numbers are 
still tiny compared to BA. For example, Silverjet's May traffic figures revealed that it carried 3,628 passengers, 
which is ahead of the expectations when it floated, but is still less than 1 per cent of BA's May traffic to the 
Americas.
However, if recent reports are to be believed, BA is taking the threat seriously - and it's rumoured to be considering 
a business-only transatlantic airline of its own.
All of this suggests that pricing conditions in the airline industry remain healthy. But things have been getting rockier 
recently. BA's May traffic data, released this week, showed a 2.1 per cent drop in traffic, which raises concerns that 
the softness reported recently by low-cost carriers easyJet and Ryanair is part of a wider downturn.
As a result, airline shares have endured a crash landing in recent weeks. Nevertheless, some analysts think the 
fears are being overdone. Gert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon sees it as a "good opportunity to pick up shares" in 
the low-cost carriers, which, he believes, still have excellent growth prospects. He also points out that this should be 
a good year for BA as it recovers from a series of one-off hits last year.
Business class battle takes to the skies
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary agrees that this is not the the start of a cyclical downturn, although he 
does warn that the industry is due one in the next few years - most likely triggered by some unpredictable "seismic 
event". He's even looking forward to it. He's waiting for the downturn to snap up cheap aircraft to launch his 
"retirement project": a transatlantic airline.
This year is shaping up to be tougher for the airlines, but that's partly because last year was so good rather than 
because of any structural change in the prospects for the industry. In the short-term, their shares are likely to be 
grounded by negative sentiment so the Maxjet float this month will be a key test of investor appetite. But medium-
term prospects still look promising, particularly as fuel costs will be lower this year. We therefore rate BA a buy at 
449p, easyJet a buy at 526p, Ryanair as fairly priced at E5.07, and Silverjet good value at 168p.

Still boasting about its passenger growth, but the Irish no-frills carrier concedes that softer yields and rising airport 
costs will limit profit growth to around five per cent a year and increase the seasonality of the business. Plus the rest 
of today's news and results Jonathan Eley
Small and mid-cap results dominate today's news flow, but hiding in a typically ebullient statement from Ryanair's 
Michael O'Leary were some distinctly downbeat comments about the outlook for no-frills airlines.
Ryanair said that market conditions have continued to soften, with load factors and yields falling. It said that while 
its forecasts for passenger growth remain, yields could fall by up to 5 per cent and unit costs will rise by 6 or 7 per 
cent owing to higher airport charges. Profit growth will, as a consequence, be limited to around 5 per cent. 
Seasonality will become more pronounced, with the airline possibly recording losses in the third and fourth fiscal 
quarters.

Airline shares encounter turbulence following soft April traffic data
Disappointing April passenger statistics have raised fears that the airline industry is entering a more turbulent time. 
Ryanair warned of pressure on yields - the difference between the ticket price and cost of operation - and said that 
the proportion of seats occupied on its flights had dropped to 83 per cent in April, down from 85 per cent in the 
same month last year. This update sent Ryanair's shares tumbling 5 per cent to 5.42.
Disappointing April passenger statistics have raised fears that the airline industry is entering a more turbulent time. 
Ryanair warned of pressure on yields - the difference between the ticket price and cost of operation - and said that 
the proportion of seats occupied on its flights had dropped to 83 per cent in April, down from 85 per cent in the 
same month last year. This update sent Ryanair's shares tumbling 5 per cent to 5.42.
easyJet also revealed signs of a weakening trading environment and, although it did maintain its full-year guidance 
(see results comment below), its shares have tumbled 14 per cent, to 618p, in the past week. British Airways (BA) 
had a poor April, too, with a 2.2 per cent fall in passenger traffic. However, a 1 per cent growth in premium traffic 
was well received so, at 501p, BA's shares have barely moved since the update.
But the lacklustre updates from the low-cost carriers has stoked fears that an era of rising yields may be over. Chris 
Avery, airline analyst at JP Morgan, says: "In 25 years of the industry's history, we only have two years of rising 
yields - there's no history of a third... and the second year ended in March." Mr Avery believes that, with their short 
lead times, the low-cost carriers are seeing the first signs of an industry-wide downturn that will eventually spread to 
the likes of BA. If this does happen, though, he expects the low-cost carriers to weather falling yields better than the 
network airlines because they can cut costs more easily.
Others are more positive, though, blaming timing and a very strong performance last year for some of the 
weakness. Sector analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort argue that easyJet faced "very tough comps this time around". 
Similarly, Andrew Fitchie, transport analyst at Collins Stewart, says BA "was cycling against a high base with Easter 
and a bank holiday in last April", and it's too soon "to extrapolate it into a trend."
Having had such a strong spring last year, it is not a surprise that the airlines have found it tougher to push through 
yield increases during this year. So, following strong share price gains, they were ripe for profit taking. But we still 
believe the trading environment is favourable, not least due to the more stable oil price. So we stick with our two 
Low-cost airlines dive on weak updates
buy tips on BA (414p, 15 September 2006) and easyJet (626p, 2 February 2007) and continue to rate Ryanair's

"They're treated as we would any other share-holder," said Aer Lingus' commercial director Stephen Kavanagh, last 
week, when asked to comment on the airline's relationship with low-cost rival Ryanair, which was left holding a 25 
per cent stake after a failed takeover bid.
The problem is that Ryanair isn't like any other shareholder. The two are in fierce competition, and it's hard not to 
paint Aer Lingus as the lumbering old warrior fighting a fleet-footed upstart.Aer Lingus has a proud history as 
Ireland's national flag-carrier, stretching back to 1936, and it remained state-owned up until its float last September. 
Ryanair, however, was founded in 1985 and expanded rapidly, overtaking Aer Lingus to become the largest 
passenger airline on the Dublin to London route.
Ryanair has also encroached relentlessly into Aer Lingus' short-haul territory, forcing it to move to a low-cost, low-
fare model to compete. Aer Lingus still charges slightly more than Ryanair, though, as it believes it can offer a 
better service, but that price gap may be hard to maintain.
The fierce rivalry spilled over into the boardroom last year, when Ryanair launched a bid for Aer Lingus just weeks 
after its float. Aer Lingus and the Irish government angrily rejected an approach that was generally labelled 
"audacious". But you wonder now why nobody saw it coming.
The two would have tremendous synergies, the float was keenly priced, and it was largely expected that Aer Lingus 
would link up with someone one day - it's just that they didn't want that someone to be Ryanair.
Ryanair allowed its E2.80 bid, which represented a 27 per cent premium to Aer Lingus' E2.20 a share float price, to 
lapse in December when the deal was referred to the European Commission. But Ryanair said that, if the deal is 
cleared, it intends to make another offer for Aer Lingus. And all the signs are that the commission, which reports 
back in mid-June, will give the deal a green light, so the Irish dogfight could soon be back on.

Aer Lingus floated on the London and Dublin stock exchanges back in September and almost immediately ran into 
turbulence when Ryanair launched an audacious hostile bid. Aer Lingus and the Irish government were strongly 
opposed to the E2.80-a-share offer and the bid failed, leaving Ryanair holding a stake of just over 25 per cent. But 
as well as being a major shareholder, Ryanair is also a formidable rival. Aer Lingus's planning director Stephen 
Kavanagh says that Ryanair's expansion at Dublin airport has led to pressure on short-haul air fares, but that strong 
passenger growth is helping to offset this.
Aer Lingus carried 8.6m passengers last year, up 9.7 per cent from a year earlier, and ancillary revenues, such as 
on-board sales and baggage charges, grew rapidly. However, underlying operating profits fell slightly last year from 
E81.4m to E76m, which Mr Kavanagh puts down to a higher fuel bill and the London terror alerts. It was E133m of 
exceptional costs relating to the float and the defence against the Ryanair bid, that led to the overall reported loss.
Broker NCB expects EPS of 20 for 2007.

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, said that third-quarter net profits rose 30 per cent to ?48m (GBP31.6m) - 
well ahead of the ?21m that analysts expected. This strong performance was driven by fare rises, double-digit 
passenger growth and baggage charges. Ryanair also increased its full-year net profit guidance from ?350m to 
?390m.
Ryanair's shares soared 7 per cent to ?11.98, but analysts also hiked their earnings estimates leaving the shares

Monday 5 february
Irish airline Ryanair issues its third-quarter results on Monday. And now that its Aer Lingus bid has lapsed, investor 
attention will focus, once again, on shareholder returns. Analysts will be particularly interested in any cost details. 
For 2007, management signalled a potential 3 per cent fall in controllable unit costs (costs per seat, excluding fuel), 
which would be a considerable improvement on the first-half rise of 3 per cent. Broker Dresdner Kleinwort expects 
adjusted EPS of 62c in 2007.
Thursday 8 February
Telephone directories business Yell reports its third-quarter results on Thursday. Analysts will be keen to see if 
third-quarter UK print growth will exceed that of the second quarter. They expect the company to report 3 per cent 
revenue growth in the UK, and 10 per cent underlying revenue growth in the US (with a 150-basis points 
improvement in margins). Broker Merrill Lynch expects adjusted EPS of 34.5p in 2007.
Jewellery retailer Signet releases a fourth-quarter trading update on Thursday. Analysts have been expecting the 
consumer outlook in both the UK and the US to deteriorate, and so will look for signs of any fall in Signet's sales. 
Watch sales at UK chain Ernest Jones will be of particular interest, as slowing watch sales dragged down store 
revenues over Christmas. Broker Seymour Pierce expects EPS of 7.7p in 2007, rising to 8.2p in 2008.

Correction
In the issues of 19 January and 26 January 2007 we published details concerning the future flotation of Barracuda. 
This information, which was supplied to investors chronicle by Digital Look, was in fact incorrect and we would like 
to sincerely apologise to both Barracuda and investment bank Citigroup.
THE ECONOMICS
On Thursday, we will find out whether the Bank of England will raise interest rates for the second time in two 
months.
Following the news that the committee was split 5-4 on last month's rise, economists think that rates will remain 
static. However, if Tuesday's survey from the British Retail Consortium confirms the CBI's report that retail sales 
boomed in January, this might change.
Also on Tuesday, official figures are likely to show that the UK's manufacturing output is still weak, and not growing 
at all in the fourth quarter. One reason for this might be seen in Friday's trade figures, which are likely to show that 
exports aren't growing very quickly, despite decent growth in world trade.
Other figures on Friday might point to this growth accelerating. The OECD is expected to report that its index of 
leading indicators for the world economy picked up last month.
Week Ahead...
Perhaps the most important figure of all, though, will be Wednesday's news on US non-farm productivity growth. 
Economists expect output per worker to rise an annualised 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, which would leave 
year-on-year growth at 1.7 per cent - substantially slower than in the past few years.
The question is: does this mean that US trend growth is slowing? Or is it merely the result of slow demand and 
labour hoarding temporarily depressing output per worker? If it's the former, low valuations on equities might be 
justified.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary admits that it looks unlikely that his audacious bid for Irish rival Aer Lingus 
will succeed. Aer Lingus's employee shareholder ownership trust (ESOT) will vote on the offer in the next few 
weeks, and Mr O'Leary says: "It looks likely they'll reject it". The ESOT owns 13 per cent of Aer Lingus, so this 
would make it difficult for Ryanair to amass a majority stake.
Mr O'Leary says that, if the bid does fail, Ryanair would retain its 19.2 per cent holding in Aer Lingus and use its 
influence to push the airline towards a lower-fare, lower-cost strategy. It's a model that certainly seems to be 
working for Ryanair. A 23 per cent jump in passenger numbers and 9 per cent increase in yields (the difference 
between the ticket price and cost of operation) drove a record-breaking first-half performance.
Fuel costs rose by 42 per cent during the period, although falling oil prices mean that the headwind should lessen 
somewhat. Ryanair has also been able to hedge half of its requirements for October to December 2007 at a price 
10 per cent lower than in the same period this year.
Broker Collins Stewart now expects EPS of 47 for the full year, rising to 68 next year (39 in 2005-06).

TUESDAY 7 November
Associated British Foods announces its full-year results on Tuesday - and investors will ask whether an improved 
performance from the retail side has been enough to offset a decline in profits from the sugar division. Consensus 
estimates suggest that it will be, with pre-tax profits expected at GBP559m and EPS of 50.4p, up from GBP479m 
and 42.2p, respectively, a year earlier. Business at its Primark chain remains strong, but its sugar arm has been hit 
by European Union measures that will cut sugar prices by allowing tariff-free imports from poor nations. Meanwhile, 
the grocery side - which boasts brands such as Twinings, Ovaltine and Ryvita - has performed well, although Allied 
Bakeries is suffering from reduced volumes and lower profitability.
THURSDAY 9 November
Hedge fund giant Man Group is expected to show the benefits of a large inflow of funds when it announces first-half 
results on Thursday. Recent figures from the European hedge-fund sector suggest that the industry's assets have 
been boosted by 22 per cent in the first six months of the year to more than $400bn (GBP210bn), with over 80 per 
cent of these managed by UK-based firms. Man has already confirmed that it has $56bn in funds under 
management, up from $44bn a year ago. It is also demerging its brokerage arm, Man Financial, which will be 
floated in New York with a value of between $3bn and $5bn. Consensus estimates are for group full-year pre-tax 
profits of $1.4bn and EPS of 58.3.

THE ECONOMICS
Almost all economists expect the Bank of England to raise the repo rate by a quarter point to 5 per cent next 
Thursday. But will this be the last rise? Figures next week could give us some clues.
The most important will be on Friday. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is 
likely to confirm then that its index of leading indicators is slowing down, albeit modestly - the six-month growth rate 
should still be higher than it was in early 2005. It should also say that global broad money growth is still strong at 
over 5.5 per cent. This matters as this growth has been a handy longer-term lead indicator of activity.
Week Ahead...
These two figures together would suggest that the world economy is about to experience a modest and short-lived 
slowdown - which might not be enough to offset the Bank of England's concerns about higher domestically 
generated inflation.
However, the OECD could also report a sharp slowdown in its measure of narrow money growth, possibly to the 
slowest rate for five years. And this could hint at a sharper global downturn.
In the eurozone, meanwhile, figures on German manufacturing orders (Monday) and output (Tuesday) will be 
important to see whether the recent fall in confidence has led to weaker activity. Recent figures on both have been 
strong, so a small dip would not be alarming. In fact, Tuesday's numbers could show that eurozone retail sales, 
having stagnated for years, are finally picking up.
Watch out, too, for the US trade report on Thursday. It's likely to show the deficit falling from last month's record.

Michael O'Leary has a reputation for audacity, but his shock swoop on Aer Lingus really took the biscuit. The chief 
executive of Ryanair made his move just three days after the Irish national airline's shares floated on the London 
and Dublin markets. Ryanair acquired a 16 per cent stake and is now offering e2.80 a share in cash for the 
remaining shares. The offer values Aer Lingus at e1.48bn and represents a 27 per cent premium to the IPO price of 
e2.20 a share. Aer Lingus has firmly rejected the offer on valuation grounds, calling the approach "wholly 
opportunistic".
But if successful, Ryanair's bid will strengthen its grip on the European low-cost airline market. It would keep the 
Aer Lingus brand, though, and the two airlines would operate separately, competing on the routes where they 
currently overlap. The combined group would carry over 50m passengers annually. This compares with other large 
airline groups, such as Lufthansa/SAS/Swiss (75m passengers), Air France/KLM (70m passengers) and BA/Iberia 
(63m passengers).
One reason Mr O'Leary gives for the bid is that Aer Lingus' earnings yield is superior to what Ryanair currently 
makes on its cash pile. However, there's more to it than that. Gaining Aer Lingus' 23 landing slots at London's 
Heathrow airport is a clear attraction, as these are like gold dust. Also, about a year ago, Mr O'Leary predicted that 
eventually only four airlines would matter in Europe: British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa and Ryanair - so the 
current bid is the first move aimed at ensuring that Ryanair is a hunter and not the prey in the consolidation chase.
The bid could even mark the start of a fresh round of takeover activity elsewhere in the sector. Rumours of a 
possible approach for British Airways (BA) are currently taxiing to the runway. A Middle Eastern group has been 
sniffing around the UK flag-carrier lately - and, as the Arab purchase of ports operator P&O and the Spanish 
acquisition of BAA have shown, even the most national of assets can fall into foreign hands.
BA is an obvious target in many respects. It's the biggest carrier at the most lucrative airport in the world and will 
soon be operating out of the new, super-efficient Terminal 5. In fact, Andrew Fitchie, transport analyst at Collins 
Stewart, believes a bid for BA is "only a matter of time". He estimates that BA's 42 per cent share of Heathrow's 
landing slots are worth around GBP2.5bn, which could support a bid at over GBP6 a share.
Bid speculation alone should therefore keep airline shares cruising at high altitude. However, the recent dramatic 
drop in the oil price and the ongoing strong demand for flights are also very helpful. Of course, August's terror scare 
in London, which led to the draconian restrictions on hand baggage, hurt BA's passenger traffic in September. But, 
Airlines on bid radar
following the relaxation of the emergency rules, passenger growth should soon bounce back. For the low-cost 
carriers, the tighter rules, which meant more checked-in baggage, may even prove to have been a windfall. Ryanair 
charges for each bag checked in, while easyJet demands a fee for anything more than one bag per passenger. And 
both airlines have pretty steep excess baggage rates.
So the confluence of takeover talk, a healthily growing global economy and the prospect of lower fuel prices, makes 
this an interesting time for the sector. We think investors should make their way to the boarding gate and prepare 
for take off.
Sterling prospects or fools' gold?
Silverjet listed on Aim in May,raising GBP25.3m to fund the launch of a new low-fare, 100-per-cent-business-class, 
transatlantic airline. Its fully extending beds and rapid check-in from a private terminal at Luton are aimed at wealthy 
corporate passengers. But its fares are firmly low-cost, with a return ticket costing an average of GBP999. This is 
way below BA's business class fares - the airline's website offers a business-class return to New York in late 
October for nearly GBP4,000. Silverjet expects to start its first service to the Big Apple within three to four months.
So the airline might be ready for take-off, but what about the shares? They've risen 8 per cent since the placing to 
121p, valuing the company at GBP36m. And although start-up airlines are always a risky investment proposition, as 
some never get off the ground, Silverjet does seem to be on track with its plans. In fact, the logic of concentrating 
on just one narrow segment of the market should enable better control of costs - and the general backdrop of 
growing air travel demand and falling oil prices is also supportive.
It's encouraging, too, that other recently launched all-business-class transatlantic airlines - the privately owned 
Maxjet and Eos - seem to be doing well. Maxjet is a low-cost business-class airline with singles starting at $679. 
Eos is at the ultra-high end of the market with specialised catering and return fares of $6,500. Both launched 
London to New York services last autumn, but have since expanded their service and route offerings. Eos recently 
said that its reservations were 62 per cent higher than the previous three-month average.
Still, with Silverjet's business at a much earlier stage, it's hard to place a value on its shares. However, they could 
be worth a punt for braver investors.

Pilots of takeover target Aer Lingus have taken a 2 per cent strategic stake in the airline. Ryanair last week 
launched an audacious E2.80-a-share offer for Aer Lingus, which was rejected by the board. This move means the 
Irish government and Aer Lingus employees, both of whom are opposed to the bid, control 42 per cent of the 
shares.
Aer Lingus shares are trading at E2.91, which looks fairly priced given there's a modest chance that Ryanair will 
increase its offer.

Shares in Irish national airline Aer Lingus have embarked upon their maiden flight, although they didn't reach the 
Irish government's desired altitude. They were initially sold for E2.20 each, at the lower end of the government's 
hoped for E2.10-E2.70 range. Prior to listing, the company slashed its workforce and fares in a bid to compete with 
the likes of budget carrier Ryanair.
Despite their subdued takeoff, the shares are an interesting proposition at E2.16. And with Aer Lingus planning to 
expand its long-haul business, they look good value.

Airlines and airports are now getting back to some kind of normality following last week's terror alert. But, as the 
airlines count the cost of the disruption, attention is turning to the long-term impact the events may have on air 
travel.
Not surprisingly, British Airways (BA), as the UK's leading transatlantic carrier, was the worst hit. Its shares fell 5 
per cent, wiping more than GBP200m off the company's stock market value. Shares in low-cost airlines Ryanair 
and easyJet dropped more modestly, though, by 1 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. Andrew Fitchie, transport 
analyst at Collins Stewart, estimates that the disruption has cost British Airways around GBP50m so far. By 
contrast, easyJet, which has faced disruption at Gatwick and Luton, is reckoned to have taken a hit of around 
GBP10m, while analysts calculate the GBP12m cost to Ryanair as less than 5 per cent of the company's pre-tax 
profits.
However, it's the ongoing implications that will have more bearing on the airlines' future. There will undoubtedly be 
a short-term shift away from air travel simply due to the disruption. Indeed, Eurostar said it had seen a 27 per cent 
increase in passenger traffic since the terror alerts. And Damian Brewer, transport analyst at investment bank JP 
Morgan, believes there could be "a windfall for UK rail operators on routes that compete with air operators". Other 
potential beneficiaries include aircraft charter brokers such as Air Partner, who will attract business travellers 
seeking to avoid check-in queues.
Nevertheless, Mr Fitchie also points out that "the general public is pretty battle-hardened" so he expects the positive 
passenger traffic demand to assert itself before too long.
On the cost side, there have been concerns that airlines might end up paying for increased security through higher 
airport charges. But, with a review of airport charging already under way amid calls to break up BAA's monopoly, 
and security measures likely to moderate with time, a major hike in charges looks unlikely.
The low-cost carriers face a different set of challenges, though. Tighter hand-baggage restrictions could threaten 
their business models, which are built on encouraging passengers to take only hand baggage in order to speed up 
turnarounds and cut down on baggage-handling costs. So while BA suffered the biggest share-price fall on the day, 
it could in fact be the low-cost carriers that ultimately feel a lasting impact.
Airlines grounded by terror threat
The underlying demand and pricing environment for airlines remains strong and, as the dust settles, that will once 
again become clear. Shares in British Airways, at 377p, look good value, trading on only 9 times forward earnings. 
EasyJet now rates fairly priced at 411p, but Ryanair, which trades on a lower rating than easyJet, still looks good 
value at ?7.25.

The airlines were flying high in the second quarter. Ryanair's adjusted net profit rose 80 per cent to a record 
E115.7m (GBP77.9m), while British Airways' (BA) pre-tax profit soared 57 per cent to GBP195m, and easyJet said 
that its total revenue per seat had risen 17 per cent to just over GBP45.
These results are all the more impressive against a backdrop of spiralling fuel costs. Ryanair, for example, said its 
fuel bill had increased by 52 per cent. But a stronger pricing environment, helped by Easter falling in the second 
quarter this year, meant that the airlines were able to offset rising fuel bills with higher ticket prices. The low-cost 
carriers were also boosted by rapidly growing ancillary revenues, which include car rental, insurance and hotels.
However, the outlook could be more turbulent. The winter months are always quieter for the airlines, and price 
competition in the short haul market, described by BA chief executive Willie Walsh as "brutal", tends to hot up when 
it's harder to get bums on seats. What's more, the oil price is back up to near record highs, so profit growth could 
stutter, as it gets increasingly difficult to offset fuel costs with fare increases. "The fuel situation is definitely an issue 
as some carriers run out of hedging," says Gert Zonneveld, transport analyst at Panmure Gordon. Indeed, Ryanair 
says that if oil prices stay above $74 a barrel, it may slip into the red over the winter.
Nevertheless, the uncertain outlook isn't putting new entrants off. Hot on the heels of recently launched transatlantic 
business carriers MAXjet and Eos, low-cost airline Zoom has announced plans to start services from the UK to the 
US and Caribbean.
Although Ryanair is sounding a cautious note, there's a good chance that a decent pricing environment will allow 
the airlines to keep their positive momentum. So shares in all three offer good value at current prices: BA at 389p, 
easyJet at 420p and Ryanair at E7.53. From the three, Ryanair presents the most upside as it's the only one whose 
shares are lower now than at the start of the year. Kirsty Campbell

Despite posting a 66 per cent rise in profits before tax for the first quarter, shares in Ryanair fell 3 per cent after 
chief executive Michael O'Leary warned that the company expects to see tough trading conditions in the winter 
months. The low-cost airline admits it could make a loss in the fourth quarter, but left its full-year-earnings guidance 
unchanged for now. Profits were boosted by strong Easter trading and fuel surcharges imposed by competitors.
After a strong recent performance, the shares are fairly priced at E7.60.

Reflecting the impact of its US sub-prime lender, Household, HSBC's provisions as a proportion of loans tend to be

Tuesday sees HBOS announce half-year figures and investors can expect the City to look for evidence that the 
growth profile - traditionally stronger than for its key rivals - remains intact. It's also worth casting an eye over the 
performance of the bank's fast-growing overseas units. And, while HBOS remains the UK's largest mortgage 
lender, a further reduction in overall market share could be possible. Teather & Greenwood expects full-year EPS of 
94.1p.
Also on Tuesday, insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson announces half-year figures. Analysis of the 
implications of its recently abandoned attempt to buy rival Heath Lambert looks likely. With softening premium rates 
in some sectors, analysts will be looking for evidence that the group can deliver decent earnings growth - an

THE ECONOMICS
Thursday's meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee will be the focus of attention next week. 
Following a surprise jump in inflation and strong retail sales, a rate rise will be on the agenda. Most economists, 
Week Ahead...
however, suspect the committee will wait before moving - although it will be a close thing. Indeed, next week's other 
developments could add to the pressure for a rise.
On Monday, we'll get Bank of England figures on bank and building society deposits. These are likely to show that 
households' money holdings are around 9 per cent higher than they were a year ago. This pent-up spending power 
is potentially inflationary. Then, on Tuesday, we'll get purchasing managers' surveys from around the world. These 
are likely to confirm that manufacturing activity is still strong.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank is likely to raise its repo rate to 3 per cent, in response to the strong 
economic upswing in the region. Although there's no reason why the Bank of England must follow, the move will 
draw attention to the fact that global inflationary pressures are mounting. Then, on Friday, we'll get the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development's leading indicators for advanced economies. These, too, are likely to 
point to a continued upswing. The same day, we'll see the US employment report. Economists expect non-farm 
payrolls to rise 145,000, in line with the recent average.

It has been a dramatic year for Northgate Information Solutions after its head office and main data centre was lost 
in the Buncefield oil depot explosion. Morgan Stanley estimates that the disaster reduced organic growth by 2 per 
cent, leaving it at 4 per cent for the year. But Northgate says it now expects organic growth to accelerate in 2006-
07, and the broker forecasts growth of 6.5 per cent in the new financial year.
That's because the company is well-positioned in growth markets such as human resources and education, where 
there is a trend towards outsourcing. Its Sx3 acquisition boosted sales, but new client wins also helped. In fact, the 
human resources division signed up 73 new clients in the period, including Boots and RyanAir. Its public service 
unit added another 57 new clients, and managed services netted 230.
So management sounds confident about the outlook, which seems justified given the increase in orders - 
particularly in education - since the year-end figure of GBP366m (from GBP370m in 2005-06). Northgate is also 
looking to overseas markets, including bolt-on acquisitions. So broker Morgan Stanley forecasts adjusted EPS for 
2006-07 of 6.03p (5.15p).

Dart Group's shares soared 9 per cent on a reassuring set of results. In fact, the owner of low-cost airline Jet2.com 
grew its underlying pre-tax profits by 6 per cent to GBP14.7m.
And while it's still dwarfed by the likes of easyJet and Ryanair, Dart says that Jet2.com has 'real strength in the 
north'. From its base in Leeds, the airline serves 26 destinations and carried 2.25m passengers over the period, up 
from just over 1.3m in the previous year.
But it's not just tourists that use Jet2.com's services. Each night, six of its aircraft are converted into post carriers for 
the Royal Mail, bringing in another revenue stream. It has also given itself some protection against high oil prices by 
hedging 80 per cent of its fuel needs for the financial year at below the current market price.
Dart's second division - the Fowler Welch-Coolchain food distribution business - also had a successful year,

Ryanair expects to overtake Lufthansa as the world's largest scheduled airline by passenger numbers later this 
year. That will be another milestone in chief executive Michael O'Leary's quest for dominance in the European 
short-haul market. The company's passenger numbers rose by 26 per cent to 35m in the year to March 2006, and 
average yields - the difference between the cost of operation and the ticket price - increased by 1 per cent. This 
pushed adjusted profits after tax up 12 per cent to a better-than-expected E302m (GBP208m), and was achieved 
despite a 74 per cent increase in fuel costs.
Mr O'Leary says that other airlines' decisions to impose fuel surcharges has pushed passengers towards Ryanair 
and led to a more helpful yield environment. He claims that this, together with continued cost-cutting, is helping the 
company to offset higher fuel costs. The airline has now hedged 90 per cent of its fuel needs to October at $70 a 
barrel so, if fuel prices stay at this level, profits are expected to rise by between 5 and 10 per cent this year, driven 
by 20 per cent passenger growth.
Oriel Securities currently expects adjusted EPS of around 40 for 2007 (39 in 2006).

The FIFA World Cup is not just important to fans, it has become increasingly important to individual businesses and 
even national economies. Deutsche Bank has estimated that the German economy will receive a E5bn boost during 
the summer, as around 3.5m fans spend their money in bars, hotels, restaurants and shops.
However, World Cup benefits are not just specific to the host country. ABN Amro (Soccernomics 2006) has 
calculated that the country that wins the World Cup enjoys an average 0.7 per cent economic boost, while the 
losing finalist suffers an average loss of 0.3 per cent, compared with the previous year. In addition, during the last 
three World Cups, the winning country's stock market has recorded an average gain of 10 per cent, against a loss 
of 25 per cent for the loser.
Whatever the result this time, there's a whole host of listed companies set for bumper sales and profits this 
summer. In addition to the pubs, bookmakers and retailers (see page 24), there are a number of other industries 
that should benefit.
Flight operators easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways will be flying out the expected 100,000 England fans to 
Germany and back. All three have already dramatically hiked air fares around key games, while easyJet and 
Ryanair also plan to provide extra flights to service all the other matches. However, their plans could be devastated 
if German air traffic controllers take industrial action in protest at privatisation.
The World Cup should also provide a big boost to ITV, which will be hoping to eclipse the 17.8m viewers who 
watched France versus England in the 2004 European Championships. A similar company, but on a smaller scale, 
is Ulster TV. Its GB Radio business outperformed the industry in 2005, thanks to strong advertising growth at 
talkSPORT, which should again set the pace in 2006, on the back of World Cup interest.
Global advertising group WPP, with clients such as Ford and American Express, is also well-positioned to capitalise 
on burgeoning advertising spending. Up to 30bn viewers worldwide are expected to tune in, making this World Cup 
bigger than the Olympics and the Super Bowl.
Finally, Goals Soccer Centres, operator of five-a-side football centres, is set for an immediate jump in revenues 
during the tournament, as football players look to emulate their heroes on the pitch. It should also see a more 
sustained increase in the months following the World Cup. Admittedly, a lot of the good news has been priced in 
already but, for a higher-risk investor, further gains cannot be ruled out.

Hopes in the airline industry of relief from soaring fuel costs have been dashed in recent weeks. Diplomatic tension 
with Iran has pushed the oil price up to a new peak of more than $71 a barrel. So while UK airline shares rose by an 
average of 49 per cent last year despite the cost of fuel, oil concerns have grounded the sector this year.
One factor that helped to cushion the airlines from the oil spike last year was hedging. However, this protection has 
now largely expired. "People are getting concerned," says Gert Zonneveld, airline analyst at Panmure Gordon. "It's 
a major cost issue for the airlines, particularly for the low-cost carriers." Fuel costs account for a larger proportion of 
total costs for the low-cost airlines than for British Airways (BA), making these firms' profits more sensitive to 
changes in the oil price.
Since the start of the year, Ryanair's shares have fallen 16 per cent. And easyJet's are down 18 per cent, following 
the decision of its major shareholder and potential takeover bidder to sell its stake in the firm. By contrast, BA's 
shares have stayed pretty flat this year.
Admittedly, conditions in the industry aren't totally unfavourable. Passenger numbers are on the up, and the airlines 
are doing a decent job of controlling their non-fuel costs. But share prices will probably stay stuck on the tarmac 
until investors feel reassured that they're coping with the latest surge in fuel costs.
Lowest cost wins
In this environment, controlling the rest of their costs is more important for the airlines than ever. That's because the 
low-cost approach to air travel is fast becoming the sector's dominant business model, at least for the short-haul 
market. The ascent of Ryanair and its other no-frills rivals has sent ticket prices tumbling over the years. Flights to 
eastern European capitals often cost less than a train ride to Bognor nowadays, which is encouraging the public to 
travel more adventurously than ever. In March, Ryanair carried more than three million passengers in Europe, more 
than BA transported across its entire global network.
Ryanair and easyJet still have huge expansion potential. Ryanair's March passenger growth was 17 per cent and 
easyJet's 7 per cent, despite a late Easter, which made trends appear less favourable. And new route possibilities 
are continually opening up. EasyJet announced last month that it would start flying to Istanbul and Marrakesh this 
summer. Ryanair is also getting in on the action, and recently announced new routes from its Frankfurt base to Fez 
and Marrakesh.
Airlines skid on oil
BA jumps onto no frills bandwagon
This low-cost revolution poses a challenge to BA and other traditional airlines. The airline's UK and European traffic 
fell by 3 per cent in March. So the former state-run carrier has now embraced the attitude that 'if you can't beat 'em, 
join 'em'. Willie Walsh, the company's new chief executive, has already taken BA into the low-cost arena with its 
regional services, which operate routes across the UK and Europe from provincial airports. These services were 
rebranded as BA Connect and offer single-class cabins as well as free food and drink.
Now, though, Mr Walsh is taking on the low-cost carriers across BA's entire short-haul network. Fares from London 
airports are to come down by as much as half in some cases, with one-way fares starting from GBP29. Accordingly, 
a one-way fare from London to Nice will now start at GBP39, compared with GBP237 a decade ago. These new, 
short-haul fares will make BA a direct competitor with the low-cost carriers. It hopes to differentiate its services with 
added frills, though, such as allocated seating and complimentary food and drink.
However, while BA's entry into the low-cost market will intensify the struggle for market share, stiff price competition 
won't necessarily lead to lower profits for the airlines. The key to this is keeping a lid on costs. Ryanair - famous for 
its free seat giveaways - makes a very healthy profit margin and easyJet doesn't do too badly either, despite 
frequent single-digit price offers.
Battle for the business buck
British Airways (BA) has clearly lost out to the low-cost airlines in short-haul. But could low-cost competition also 
start to eat into BA's long-haul premium routes? The premium market is BA's real bread and butter because these 
services allow for juicy price rises during the good times. Even here, though, it is already facing a new breed of 
rival, albeit from the top end of the market rather than the bottom.
In the past six months, two new airlines have launched services that compete directly with BA's business class 
services. Maxjet, described as "the industry's first, low-fare, all-business-class airline", began a London to New York 
service in November. Maxjet's fares start at $679 one way, which compares with BA's lowest published London to 
New York business class fare of $3,416 (GBP1,913). In October, Eos, a single-class, premium airline which offers 
lie-flat seats and boutique catering, began flying between London and New York with a return fare of $6,500.
Now, another new rival is taxiing to the runway. Silverjet, a new British airline, has recently announced plans to float 
on Aim in order to raise GBP25m. The start-up will also operate business class flights on the London to New York 
route. In terms of pricing and service offering, it will be somewhere between Eos and Maxjet with return fares 
averaging around GBP999 ($1,784) and some luxury touches, including a lie-flat bed.
The logic behind all these start-ups is that focusing on just one narrow segment of the market allows even better 
control of costs. Without the additional expense of managing crowds of economy class passengers, these new 
business-only airlines hope to be able to undercut the all-things-to-all-people flag-carriers such as BA.
So far, BA's business class services haven't suffered. In March, premium passenger numbers rose 15 per cent. For 
the moment, then, it's hard to envisage the new entrants causing BA much trouble. The London-New York route is 
already quite competitive and the upstarts are tiny fish in a giant ocean. Also, many corporate passengers have little 
choice when it comes to their flights since their employers are signed up to bulk deals with a particular airline - and 
BA has no shortage of these preferred carrier deals in place.

 TUESDAY 7 FEBRUARY
 Forget the Euro lottery millions, the oil majors deal in billions these days and BP - which reports final results on 
Tuesday - is no exception. The City is looking for record pre-tax profits of £19bn, up from £13bn last year. Apart 
from the usual discussion on how long the profit-driving oil price rally can last, expect attention to focus on BP's 
Russian plans, following recent speculation that the group may seek to shut down its loss-making refinery in 
Ukraine.
WEDNESDAY 8 FEBRUARY
 On Wednesday, industrial gases group BOC reports first-quarter results, but the numbers are likely to be 
overshadowed by bid speculation. BOC recently hit the headlines after rejecting a £7.6bn approach from German 
rival Linde. The bid was deemed too low, but rumours persist of a higher offer. The results will also give BOC the 
chance to outline its plans as an independent firm, including a plant-expansion programme and acquisitions.
 THURSDAY 9 FEBRUARY
 Barclays reports full-year results on Thursday. The City expects pre-tax profits of £5.2bn, against £4.6bn last year. 
Investors will look for an update on its international businesses, which include a controlling stake in South Africa's 
largest retail bank, Absa. Barclays' growing international presence marks it out from its more UK-focused peers who 
are suffering from flatter domestic markets.

 The Economics
 Next week's main event will be the monetary policy committee's interest rate announcement on Thursday. 
Economists expect it to quash hopes of an early cut, and leave the repo rate unchanged at 4.5 per cent. One 
reason for this decision is likely to be that the world economy is picking up. Data on Monday and Tuesday are set to 
show that industrial production and new orders in Germany - once the sick man of Europe - are 5-6 per cent higher 
than a year ago. And, on Friday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is likely to report 
that its index of global leading indicators is rising, too.
 However, the UK seems not to be sharing in the global upturn. Wednesday's official numbers are likely to show 
that manufacturing output has been flat for the past two years. This is a marked contrast to the US or Germany, 
where it has risen more than 10 per cent. Yet it's possible that this is partly due to a measurement problem as 
official UK figures on output have been weaker than surveys by the Confederation of British Industries or Chartered 
Institute of Purchasing and Supply would suggest. But another figure will confirm that the UK isn't benefiting much 
from the worldwide upswing. Thursday's trade balance is forecast to show a big deficit, and that exports have not 
risen as much in recent months as the rise in world trade would suggest.
 Investors should also watch out for the US's trade deficit, on Friday. At $64bn, this is likely to be smaller than in 
recent months.

When British Airways (BA) sold its low-cost subsidiary Go in 2001, chief executive Rod Eddington said: "As a no-
frills operator, it simply does not fit with our full-service strategy."
What a difference four years make. This week, BA announced a revamp of its regional CitiExpress service - now 
BA Connect - that sees the operation move into low-cost territory.
"BA is adopting similar techniques to low-cost airlines," says Chris Avery, transport analyst at JP Morgan. From 
March, the cabin will be single class and passengers will pay for food and drinks. Fares will be slashed by more 
than 40 per cent, with tickets starting at GBP25 - prices that David Evans, managing director of CitiExpress, says 
"match the no-frills airlines".
In 2001, BA said that the sale of Go would allow it to focus on business-class passengers and restore its loss-
making European services to profit. But those services still lose GBP30m a year, so BA hopes this latest overhaul 
will improve profitability.
The low-cost model is winning the battle for the skies on short-haul flights at least. And FL Group, the owner of 
Icelandair, wants a piece of the action. FL Group has built a 16.2 per cent stake in easyJet, which makes it the 
second-largest shareholder after founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou. EasyJet's shares have risen 6 per cent in the past 
week on rumours that FL Group will launch a bid.
Also this week, easyJet released traffic data that showed it carried 30m passengers last year, up 18 per cent from 
2004. Mr Avery believes the low-cost model will continue to thrive and anticipates "10 years of low-cost growth". 
Ryanair's passenger numbers grew by 26 per cent to 33m, but the airline warned in December that late delivery of 
new aircraft would reduce passenger numbers between January and March.
So what now for BA's more discerning business customers? It's hard to see them joining the single-class masses 
with their 50p packets of peanuts. Instead, they may turn to business jets for the luxury they seek - good news for 
the likes of aircraft charter broker Air Partner.
This was the first major move from BA's new chief executive Willie Walsh and it looks sensible. But the real 
challenges - open skies, pension and wage negotiations, and the move to Terminal 5 - are still to come. 
Nevertheless, BA's shares look good value at 330p, trading on 11.5 times forward earnings. EasyJet's shares have 
BA embraces no-frills model
soared to 400p and, while their rating is sky high at 24 times prospective earnings, shareholders should sit tight as 
a bid now looks a real possibility. Ryanair's shares are fairly priced at ?7.92, or 20 times forward earnings.

 As if overeating, excess drinking and being cooped up in each other's company wasn't bad enough, the gods 
contrived one further Christmas ritual to put family members at each other's throats: Boxing Day is the traditional 
date for choosing next year's family holiday.
 This year, many will have plumped for the old favourite: the package holiday. Reports of its death have been much 
exaggerated. We may be less likely to choose the traditional two weeks on a Spanish beach - bookings for Spanish 
holidays have fallen by 25 per cent over the past decade, and Thomson and Thomas Cook axed more than one-
quarter of a million Spanish holidays from their brochures this year. But Spain is still the number-one destination for 
British holidaymakers, and the package deal is still the most popular way we take our holidays. Government 
statistics show that just under half of our overseas holidays are packages - so there has been little change in the 
number of package holidays sold in the past five years.
This suggests a stagnant market, but there is good news for investors. While there has been little change in the 
number of package holidays, there has been a phenomenal increase in the amount of travelling we do. The official 
figures show the number of visits abroad by UK residents has almost tripled since 1984, to a record 64.2m visits a 
year.
 The big winners are the budget airlines. Ten years ago, they didn't exist. Freddie Laker's Skytrain had long-since 
hit the buffers - so the only cheap flight was a charter flight. Then in November 1995, a garish-orange plane took off 
from Luton, heading for Glasgow. Easyjet was born. Shortly afterwards, Ryanair started its first cut-price British 
service, the beginning of its transformation from a domestic Irish commuter service into one of Europe's aviation 
giants.
 Their impact on our travel, on business and on society has been so astonishing that it's easy to forget they've only 
been around for a decade. They have helped slash the cost of travel - not just by reducing their own prices, but by 
forcing the other major carriers, such as BA and KLM, to follow suite. In 1980, a return ticket on Europe's busiest 
route, London to Paris, would have cost the equivalent of one week's wages. Today, the same ticket can cost as 
little as half a day's pay.
 So, now, the number of people flying from the UK to Barcelona has gone up around 180 per cent in the past 10 
years. And the number flying to Prague is up 400 per cent. As for Alicante, the number of passengers is up, not 200 
per cent, but 2,000 per cent. Some of these extra journeys were made by people who had never flown before 
Winter Blues
because they couldn't afford to. Many others are by well-heeled folk who now fly more frequently. The Civil Aviation 
Authority says half of the passengers on budget airlines come from the richest quarter of society, following the 
boom in second homes across France, Spain and Portugal - and now eastern Europe.
 The biggest impact of all has been on the airline industry itself. When Ryanair switched to a low-fares strategy in its 
home Irish market in the early 1990s, its establishment rival, Aer Lingus, thought it was just a one-off promotion. 
Then it realised the promotion was permanent. Aer Lingus was caught on the hop. Now it and all the other major 
carriers have cut back on their full service, and fought back with lower prices.
 As a result, the major airlines have been notoriously bad investments. American investment guru Warren Buffet 
was once quoted as saying that, if he could go back in time, he'd shoot the Wright brothers before they invented 
their aeroplane, saving shareholders from multi-million-pound losses and a lot of heartache. US carriers pop in and 
out of bankruptcy protection. Many European operators just scrape by from year to year. The low-cost airlines, by 
contrast, have seen bumper growth. In recent months, however, easyJet's growth has faltered and its shares have 
been given a kicking. Ryanair suffered after its warning of a "fares bloodbath". Just before Christmas, it announced 
it would cancel 1,200 flights during the winter. It blamed delays to the delivery of new aircraft, critics claim it's 
because its runaway growth is running out of steam.
 What's more, the low-cost airlines will face ever-tougher competition in the future - from each other and from the 
bigger carriers. Oil prices also remain stubbornly high. Airports are demanding a greater financial share from the 
boom in passenger numbers, too. And, despite the 1 per cent decline in capacity between 2000 and 2004, industry 
bosses such as Michael O'Leary say there are still too many seats chasing too few passengers and mergers or 
closures are on the cards.
 But some analysts are calling for an in-flight reality check. They say growth for the low-cost airlines is merely 
descending from the stratospheric. Market researcher Mintel claims the budget airlines will still enjoy the biggest 
growth in the industry over the next five years. Compared with the full-service airlines, the slowdown will still feel 
like a boom.

Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, predicts that, longer term, only two low-cost airlines will remain listed - 
his and easyJet. But, for now at least, Dart's Jet2.com seems to be doing relatively well. The Manchester, Bradford 
and Leeds-based airline flew over 1.25m passengers in the first half, up from 570,000 last year.
And far from retreating from the market, Jet2.com is adding new bases - Newcastle, Blackpool, Belfast and 
Edinburgh - and buying bigger planes. Aviation turnover rose 53 per cent to GBP119.6m. Even so, Dart warns that, 
in line with the usual seasonal pattern, Jet2.com will make a loss in the winter.
Dart also has a distribution business, which supplies chilled food to UK supermarkets. It entered into significant new 
warehousing contracts in the first half, and also won business with Somerfield. The division's turnover rose 8 per 
cent to GBP55.2m.
Rowan Dartington expects full-year, adjusted pre-tax profit of GBP14.5m, giving EPS of 28.7p (from GBP14m and

Ryanair and British Airways (BA) released first-half results this week revealing that yields - the difference between 
operating costs and ticket prices - have gained altitude for the first time in years. Ryanair's yields rose 3 per cent 
during the first half, while BA's were up 1.5 per cent. This is significant news - Andrew Lobbenberg, transport 
analyst at ABN Amro, "can't remember when BA last reported a quarterly price increase effect". EasyJet, 
meanwhile, reported that passenger numbers grew 13.7 per cent in October.
But what does the future hold? The winter is a tougher time for airlines, so both Ryanair and BA expect yields to fall. 
Ryanair thinks that its yield drop in its fourth quarter to March could reach 10 per cent, although around half of this 
will be due to Easter falling later next year. Then there's the fuel-cost headwind, which BA has tried to offset with 
fuel surcharges. BA said this week that kerosene prices have continued to rise, but Tony Shepard, transport analyst 
at Charles Stanley, believes "the price of fuel will probably head down next year."
There is also uncertainty from the impact of slower consumer spending, which could see people less keen to jet off 
on weekend city breaks. That would probably leave low-cost operators most exposed. BA has some protection, as it 
is more geared towards business travel and the current deal-making boom, which has seen jet-set bankers and 
lawyers boost BA's premium traffic. However, some analysts are concerned that the best of this premium growth 
may have already been seen.
The outlook for the airlines is, as ever, dependent on many factors, many of them macroeconomic. But the future 
still looks fairly positive - they have coped well with fuel costs so far, and there are no signs of weakening 
passenger traffic. BA's shares - trading at 310p, or 12 times forecast earnings for the current year - look the best 
value. And Ryanair's shares - at E6.83 or 17 times forecast earnings for the current year - look fairly priced, given 
its growth prospects. But easyJet's shares are high enough, at 307p, or a flighty 21 times forecast earnings for the 
current year.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary believes that eventually there will be only four airlines that matter in 
Europe - Ryanair, British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa. Mr O'Leary aims to double passenger numbers and 
profits by 2012, and expects rival low-cost operators to fold or be taken over.
And the airline's first-half performance was strong. Fuel costs rose 108 per cent to E237m, pushing unit costs up by 
8 per cent. But passenger numbers grew by more - up 29 per cent to 18m as Ryanair added new routes. What's 
more, revenue per passenger rose 3 per cent. So adjusted post-tax profits rose by 18 per cent to a record E237m. 
Ancillary revenues, such as insurance and car hire, rose 40 per cent, and could potentially be a major revenue 
contributor if Ryanair's in-flight gambling initiative takes off.
But despite these solid results, management's outlook comments were cautious. Mr O'Leary expects the growth in 
revenue per passenger to peter out in the second half, as Easter falls later next year, and the airline will keep fares 
low to fill increased capacity on its Dublin flights.
Broker SG Securities expects full-year EPS of 40 (from 35.1 in 2004).

Monday 7 November
Ryanair, which announces interim results on Monday, recently boasted that it carried more passengers than British 
Airways (BA) in August. Although this was mainly down to the Gate Gourmet strike fiasco, which led to the 
cancelling of BA flights, it points to Ryanair's stated ambition to be Europe's biggest airline by 2010. But the 
company's colourful chief executive, Michael O'Leary, is more cautious on expected trading this winter. At the 
trading update last month, he told investors that, although yields would benefit from European rivals in Europe 
adding fuel surcharges to fares, competitors would also be trimming their underlying fares to compete with 
Ryanair's prices.
Tuesday 8 November
Just as Twiggy seemed to have worked her magic at Marks and Spencer (M&S), George Davies resigned from the 
company last month ahead of the half-year results. The consultant to the Per Una business leaves in 12 months, 
along with Andrea White and Melanie Davies, respectively Per Una's finance director and head of merchandising. 
M&S's second-quarter trading statement in October was positive, revealing like-for-like sales up 1.3 per cent 
compared with a fall of 5.4 per cent in the first quarter, boosted by a "positive" customer reaction to the new autumn 
ranges. But the City fears the loss of Mr Davies is a "massive blow" to the company. Analysts expect full-year EPS 
of 20.2p.

 630p - Transport - BAA's decent dividend income, combined with its utility-like regulated nature, has proved 
beguiling for investors searching for steady capital appreciation. But several key factors affecting BAA's 
performance have recently turned more negative.
 First, the growth in the number of passengers passing through BAA's airports is slowing. In its financial year to 
March, passenger growth was 6 per cent as air travel recovered from 11 September 2001's terrorist attacks and the 
Sars virus outbreak. Then, in July, BAA said that it expected 3.5 per cent growth in the current year. But, in last 
month's trading update, the group was forced to trim this growth forecast to 3 per cent, causing brokers to cut 
earnings estimates. London's terrorist attacks and industrial action at Heathrow have undoubtedly accounted for 
some of the slippage, although analysts have pointed out that there are other longer-term concerns. Gatwick airport 
is suffering from the declining charter market, while Stansted's low-cost airline driven boom is petering out. Ryanair 
is involved in a public spat with BAA over its plans for Stansted, and has established a new base at Luton, run by 
rival airport operator, TBI. Growth at Heathrow, meanwhile, is being held back by capacity constraints.
Second, there is the risk that the consumer soft patch could hit BAA's airport shops. Conditions on the high-street 
are miserable - the Confederation of British Industry's retail survey recorded the fastest year-on-year sales decline 
in its 22-year history in September. So far, BAA seems to be bucking the trend. The group's recent trading update 
reported that its retail business was performing well. But fellow airport retail operator Alpha Airports recently flagged 
up a worsening airport retail environment, and there's a risk that BAA will suffer.
 Third, there are concerns on the regulatory front. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulates BAA's London 
airports and it decides what BAA can charge airlines for using its airports. With the group heading into the latter half 
of its current regulatory period, attention is turning to the CAA's intentions for the new regime, which will start in 
April 2008. The CAA is expected to publish a consultation paper in the next few months, and there are worries that 
BAA's allowable returns may be trimmed.
 One thing that still attracts investors to BAA is its monopoly - its position as operator of the UK's key airports is 
unthreatened by competitors. But this monopoly structure has provoked criticism from its airline customers, 
particularly Ryanair. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, is highly critical of BAA's £4bn plan to expand 
Stansted, calling it "gold-plating on a rip-off scale", adding that the "CAA stands idly by while BAA ignores the 
stated wishes of airline users at Stansted." This monopoly backlash was again in evidence at the recent Labour 
BAA (BAA)
Party conference where anti-BAA beer mats were handed out. All of this increases the pressure on the CAA to 
deliver a fair deal, perhaps at the expense of BAA's profits.
 There's also some uncertainty over BAA's earnings potential. That's because, at present, BAA capitalises the 
interest on its Heathrow Terminal 5 project, rather than charging it through the profit and loss account. And, 
according to analysts at investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, after excluding capitalised interest, 
earnings would actually decline over the next three years. When Terminal 5 opens in 2009, the broker expects 
reported earnings to fall 35 per cent, and this issue clouds future earnings.
 Strip out exceptional items, and investment bank JP Morgan expects adjusted earnings per share of 42p for 2006, 
which leaves the shares trading on 15 times expected earnings. So this above-market rating looks unjustified, given 
that the group's outlook is more clouded than it has been for some time. With the shares already trading near a 
three-year high, sell.

 Low-cost airline Ryanair was this week crowing over August's passenger data, which showed that it had overtaken 
strike-hit British Airways (BA) for the first time. BA's passenger numbers slumped 4 per cent to 3.1m, against 
Ryanair's 3.26m.
 This is a glimpse of what's to come - Ryanair plans to be Europe's largest airline by 2012 - but the shares, trading 
on a chunky PE ratio of 19 times at E6.8, are fairly priced. Meanwhile, BA's premium traffic growth story should 
soon return so, at 286p, and on a PE ratio of 11, its shares are good value.

 If nothing else, say some analysts, Gate Gourmet got one thing right. The catering company is under intense fire 
for sacking almost 700 of its workers, triggering a wave of strikes across Heathrow Airport that grounded its main 
customer, British Airways (BA). Thousands of passengers were stranded, and BA is thought to have lost £30m. Yet 
at the very height of the disruption, Gate Gourmet's boss told one of my BBC colleagues that the real industrial 
problems lay at BA, not in his food factory. Why, he asked, were BA's baggage handlers and other workers so 
willing to down tools because of a dispute at another company?
That is the chord that chimed with the analysts. BA is no stranger to strikes. It suffered from a major walk out two 
summers ago, and narrowly avoided another bust-up last year. The spark in 2003 was the airline's plans for a new 
swipe-card system, but the underlying reason was BA's overall drive for more efficient ways of working. BA had 
already axed thousands of jobs after the terror attacks on the US in September 2001. The company's management 
- and its major investors - thought that more was needed to keep up with budget rivals at home and slimmed-down 
competitors abroad.
 The City worried then that BA did not have its workers onside to deliver the extra savings that it expected. And the 
big shareholders will become more concerned the closer we get to BA's move to Terminal Five. The airline will want 
to negotiate new terms and conditions before it shifts to its new home - it currently has different agreements with 
workers in each of Heathrow's existing terminals, and unifying those deals makes commercial sense. The wildcat 
strikes two weeks ago may have been triggered by Gate Gourmet's troubles, but investors are concerned that they 
may also have been a flexing of union muscle ahead of those talks concerning Terminal Five.
 BA's new boss, Willie Walsh, earned himself a reputation as an industrial hardman when he beat Aer Lingus into 
shape against Ryanair's ferocious competition. He may follow the mellower example of the man he is replacing, Sir 
Rod Eddington. "Success is mutually dependent on everyone pulling together to achieve the same business goals," 
said Sir Rod. Or he may plump for an intense, but brief, confrontation to bring rebellious staff to heel. He made it 
work at Dublin Airport, but Aer Lingus was on the verge of going bust, while BA is hugely profitable. The trauma of 
Gate Gourmet could tell him that the short, sharp shock may not be so easy to pull off at Heathrow.

 Low-cost airline Ryanair announced record first-quarter results driven by a 30 per cent jump in passenger 
numbers.
Despite leaving full-year guidance unchanged, Ryanair was cautious on the outlook, drawing attention to the 
continued drag of high oil prices, and the possibility of further terrorist attacks in London hitting passenger volumes.
 On 19 times forward earnings, the high oil price leaves the shares looking fairly priced for now at E6.81. But 
Ryanair has excellent long-term growth prospects, and we prefer it to the more expensively rated easyJet.

 Ryanair has come a long way in 20 years. Back in 1985 - Ryanair's first year of operation - the airline carried 5,000 
people on its single route between Ireland and Gatwick. Last year, Ryanair ferried 27.6m passengers on 229 
routes.
Rapid passenger growth has been achieved through the expansion of the fleet while maintaining the lowest prices 
in the sky. Ryanair's average fare of E41 compares favourably both to easyJet's E62 and British Airways' E268. 
Ryanair now plans to be Europe's largest airline by 2012, carrying over 70m passengers a year - and it expects to 
overtake BA's monthly traffic later this summer.
 What's more, Ryanair is converting this rampant passenger growth into hard profits. Adjusted profit after tax rose 
19 per cent last year, to E268.9m, despite fierce competition and the high oil price. The company has controlled 
costs by using newer and more efficient aircraft, as well as through flying to cheaper airports.
 Looking ahead, advance bookings are strong, and chief executive Michael O'Leary says: "We are a touch more 
optimistic than a year ago". The company is still working on the basis that its average fares will fall this year, but 
they are flat so far. Goodbody Stockbrokers expect EPS of 36.

 easyJet is getting more people on its planes, but still needs to prove that it can generate earnings growth from 
them. Solid revenue growth in the first half mirrored the 25 per cent increase in passengers, but the pre-tax loss 
widened slightly.
 Management points out that, as a percentage of revenue, the scale of the losses reduced from 6.2 to 5.6 per cent. 
But while this is not a bad performance, it wasn't good enough to sustain the recent share price rally, and the 
shares fell victim to profit-taking. The market is watching for signs that easyJet can lower its costs and kick-start 
earnings growth. This will be difficult, though, as it struggles to absorb rocketing fuel prices, which make up 18 per 
cent of its cost base.
Nevertheless, easyJet will return to profit in the second half, in line with the usual seasonal pattern, driven by the 
summer holiday period. And although the airline expects reported full-year pre-tax profit to be below last year, 
because of higher fuel costs, the City has already factored this into forecasts.
 Broker Merrill Lynch expects pre-tax profit, before goodwill amortisation, of £66m for the full year (from £79m last 
year), giving EPS of 10.8p (14.3p).

 Tuesday 31 may
 Despite the soaring cost of jet fuel, Ryanair is set to reveal further progress on Tuesday. Another big jump in 
passenger numbers, along with impressive control of costs, is forecast to have lifted full-year pre-tax profits from 
E228.5m to E268.5m over the past year. The key elements to the Irish low-cost airline's success this year will be 
further cost control and good summer trading.
Wednesday 1 june
 Having begun the new year with a profit warning, Northern Foods has managed to avoid further mishaps. But the 
food processor says that conditions in the industry are still making life difficult, particularly ingredient costs and 
selling price trends. Under its new chief executive, Wednesday's announcement should see Northern trying to 
reassure investors about to its progress. Expect full-year, pre-tax profits of £78m, giving EPS 12.8p.
 Thursday 2 june
 Excitement about Splenda - Tate & Lyle's sweetener - sent shares in the ingredients maker soaring last year. 
Although the rally continued into 2005, it has faltered lately, with concern over high sugar prices. Shareholders will

 THE ECONOMICS
 Economists believe next week's figures will confirm that the US economy is in a soft patch. They expect 
Wednesday's ISM survey of manufacturing to give its lowest reading for almost two years, and Friday's non-farm 
payrolls to post a gain of just 175,000. This would give an average gain in the past three months of just under 
200,000, which is low for an economic expansion.
 Purchasing managers' surveys in the UK, Japan and the eurozone, all due out on Wednesday, will show how far 
this soft patch is spreading around the world. They are likely to point to falling manufacturing output in the UK and 
eurozone.
 There will also be figures next week regarding UK consumer spending. These could be mixed. The good news is 
that consumer confidence data, due on Wednesday, is expected to be quite high, while households' bank deposits, 
out on Tuesday, are growing strongly - by over 9 per cent year-on-year. But Monday's figures are likely to show that 
the M0 measure of the money stock, which has been correlated with retail sales in the past, is slowing, while 
Tuesday's figures are likely to show that mortgage lending - and, more especially, mortgage approvals - are 
weakening.
 There will, though, be some good news. Tuesday should see an upward revision to US first-quarter productivity 
growth, following upward revisions to GDP. This growth will be lower than in recent years, but it augurs well for 
long-term economic growth.

 The future is orange. Well, for short hops across to Spain at least. This week, easyJet reported that passenger 
volumes were up by 25 per cent in April, well ahead of forecasts. Ryanair had a good April, too, with its passenger 
volumes also rising by 25 per cent. By contrast, British Airways (BA) reported last week that short-haul passenger 
volumes fell by 5 per cent in the same period.
What's more, easyJet filled 85.2 per cent of its available seats, up from 81.6 per cent a year ago. By contrast, BA 
filled only 68.7 per cent of its seats, against 69.4 per cent last year. The low-cost carriers' performance is even 
more impressive given that the busy Easter period fell in April last year, but March this year.
 And growth should continue for both. easyJet also announced that its fleet has now reached 100 aircraft, and will 
increase to 150 by 2007. Ryanair's fleet will reach 140 by then, up from 80 now. This fleet expansion puts these two 
airlines well ahead of the other low-cost minnows, and will continue to drive passenger growth as new routes and 
destinations are added.
 But BA is more than just a flag-carrying dinosaur doomed to extinction at the hands of the low-cost carriers. Its 
business model is completely different. As Tony Shepard, transport analyst at Charles Stanley, points out: "80 per 
cent of BA is now long-haul, international traffic".
 So, despite lower short-haul volumes - where the low-cost airlines are clearly taking market share - BA is doing 
well. Its premium passenger volumes rose by 13 per cent in April, the seventh consecutive month of premium traffic 
rises. This is the juicy segment for BA where there is potential to raise fares.
 Ryanair and easyJet's race to establish themselves as Europe's leading low-cost carrier has cost them earnings 
growth in recent years. But with their market positions now firmly established, the earnings outlook is rosier. We 
prefer Ryanair to easyJet, due to its more attractive rating. BA, meanwhile, is enjoying a premium traffic recovery, 
and we continue to believe that its shares offer good value.

Low-cost airlines carried 21 per cent more passengers, with Gatwick, used by easyJet and Ryanair, the fastest-
growing airport.
 Following a steep take-off, BAA's shares have run out of steam lately. For the long term, though, the company 
remains a good value play on the growth in air travel.

 Budget airline Ryanair saw off the bears this week as it reported robust nine-month results and a substantial 
upgrade to full-year guidance. The feared winter bloodbath among low-cost airlines has been more of a storm in a 
teacup for Ryanair - fares were maintained and traffic levels improved 13 per cent.
 There have been some casualties in the battle for the low-cost skies (notably Volare and Air Polonia), but both 
Ryanair and rival easyJet are performing well. However, the UK's smaller listed operators, EUjet (owned by 
Planestation) and Jet2.com (owned by Dart), may find it more difficult to deal with the competitive pressures.
Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary, believes that traditional airlines are facing "a permanent shift towards 
low-cost air travel". British Airways (BA) will have a chance to respond to that challenge when it reports nine-month 
results today (4 Feb). BA has kept a foot in the low-cost market with cheap deals on specific routes but, ultimately, 
premium travel is its strength.
 Its premium traffic rose by 6.8 per cent in December - the third consecutive month of premium traffic rises - which 
bodes well as strong volumes could bring scope to increase premium fares.
 Fuel costs are a key driver of earnings and investor sentiment for the airlines. Brent Crude is currently at $45 a 
barrel - well below last year's highs of $55 - but oil analysts remain divided on its likely direction over the year. JP 
Morgan's oil analysts are forecasting that Brent will drop to $35 this year, which implies a substantial reduction in 
airline fuel prices.
 Since we recommended buying BA shares at 203p (29 October 2004) they have risen 34 per cent to 272p. But this 
is eclipsed by the gains made by the low-cost carriers - Ryanair shares are up 40 per cent and easyJet's 34 per 
cent in the past three months. All three companies have scope to benefit from further oil price relief, earnings 
upgrades and strong fundamentals for air travel. We like BA for its premium pricing potential and prefer Ryanair to 
easyJet, whose share price already reflects bid hopes.

 NEWS
 Monday 31 January
 Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary recently said that "Ryanair is the Tesco of the airline industry". Today is 
his chance to prove it as the low-cost carrier reports third-quarter results. The market is waiting to see if strong 
passenger growth continued in December and will also be watching for signs that yields are under pressure. 
Ryanair is expected to break even in the second half, with analysts forecasting full-year profits of E200m (£138m).
 Wednesday 1 February
 Travis Perkins is holding an extraordinary meeting to approve its £950m Wickes acquisition. The builders' 
merchant had been chasing Wickes for some time and the deal is seen as a good fit, allowing Travis Perkins to 
enter the high-growth DIY market. The acquisition still needs to be cleared by the Office of Fair Trading, but Travis 
Perkins does not expect any problems.
Thursday 3 February
 Royal Dutch Shell reports final results with the market looking for pre-tax profits of £5.5bn. Shell is struggling to 
restore its reputation after last year's oil-reserves scandal. The company's new chief executive, Jeroen van der 
Veer, has promised a review of the company's method of oil-reserve accounting and Shell is now re-checking its 
entire reserve pool.

 RESULTS UPDATE: Last week, we reported that Teather & Greenwood was advising investors to hold Bradford & 
Bingley's shares (21 January 2005, page 36). Shortly after that edition went to press, the broker downgraded its 
recommendation to a 'sell' - it says this reflects the "stellar short-term performance" of the shares.
 THE ECONOMICS
 Next week should give us more clues about how quickly consumer spending and house-price inflation are slowing 
down. On Monday, the CBI will report on January's retail sales. This, at least, should show a less bleak picture than 
last week's official figures for December. On Tuesday, though, the Bank of England is likely to report a big fall in the 
numbers of mortgage approvals.
 However, HBOS's latest report on house prices is likely to be less downbeat than the lending numbers would 
suggest. And other figures from the Bank of England should show that households' cash holdings are rising 
strongly, which should underpin spending.
Week Ahead…
 It's not just the consumer picture that's unclear. So, too, is manufacturing. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing 
and Supply is likely to report on Tuesday that output rose in January. For months, though, this survey, like that of 
the CBI, has given a brighter reading of manufacturers' fortunes than official data has.
 In the US, meanwhile, the big headline will be the Fed's rate rise - to 2.5 per cent - on Wednesday. But a more 
interesting story is that labour productivity growth is slowing down. It's likely to be up by an annualised 1.9 per cent 
in the fourth quarter. That's only half the average growth since 1999.  In this context, investors should see Friday's 
strong job creation - non-farm payrolls might be up by around 185,000 - not as a sign of fast economic growth, but 
as a sign that corporate efficiency is now growing more slowly.

 He nursed his airline from crippling losses to bumper profits. He cut routes, slashed costs and forced through 
thousands of job losses. He clashed with trade unions and endured bruising strike action. He fought off competition 
from the budget airlines.
It could be British Airways' chief executive, Rod Eddington. It could also be the man who's tipped by some to 
succeed him. Willie Walsh is, until the end of this month, the chief executive of the Irish state airline, Aer Lingus. He 
is hailed as the man who rescued the carrier from the brink of bankruptcy, and he's leaving after another clash with 
his majority shareholder - the Irish government - amid a public storm about what his next move is.
 Of course, there's no immediate vacancy at British Airways (BA). Mr Eddington was appointed on a rolling contract 
in May 2000 - so there's no confirmed leaving date. He even said recently that he has no intention of quitting, telling 
reporters that he still has a "couple of laps" in him. Yet the airline industry is guessing when he'll leave, and who will 
get the job when he does.
 Mr Eddington and Mr Walsh faced similar problems - a worldwide economic slowdown, the after-effects of the 
terrorist attacks on America and tough competition from nimble, low-cost carriers. But, if anything, Mr Walsh had 
tougher going. Aer Lingus was losing E25m every day after 11 September 2001 - many analysts thought that it 
would go bust. So he shut 25 per cent of its operations, and cut the workforce from 6,108 to 4,281 within two years. 
Last autumn, he scrapped another 1,300 jobs - one-third of the remaining workforce - to bring costs into line with 
Ryanair's.
 And that was part of his problem with the Irish government. Commentators say that there wasn't the same political 
support for the latest cuts, now that the airline is on track for a E100m profit. The other issue is funding. A 
government-commissioned report from Goldman Sachs says that Aer Lingus is cash-starved. Mr Walsh and his 
colleagues tried to buy the airline from the state. They were rebuffed.
 Substitute labour relations for political tussles, and you've got another of Mr Eddington's problem at BA - 
persuading workers that the company has to stay lean, even though it's profitable again. Mr Walsh has seen all of 
that at Aer Lingus. He also took on Ryanair, and turned his carrier into a semi-low-cost airline. It might be just the 
trick that BA needs to shake-up its short-haul routes in Europe. That's why some analysts say that BA might be the 
right place for Mr Walsh's next move

 After the warnings about a bumpy flight, the landing appeared to be pretty smooth. Earlier this year, easyJet told 
shareholders to adopt the brace position, take off high-heeled shoes and prepare to see profits slip down the 
emergency slide. This week, it revealed that it actually made more money, with pre-tax profits up 21 per cent.
But run the headline figures through the X-ray machine, and a different picture emerges. The company admits that 
its underlying profits actually fell 11 per cent. And the business appears less efficient in some critical areas. The 
typical revenue per passenger has fallen 2 per cent as cut-throat competition trims ticket prices. And the time each 
plane spends in the air (earning money) has fallen from 11.1 hours a day to 10.5 hours a day.
 easyJet's headline profits are growing, partly because it has laid on extra routes. In most businesses, relying on 
new business for profits growth is perfectly acceptable. But in the budget airline world, it's not enough. At least, 
that's the opinion of the man who runs that daddy of all them all: SouthWest Airlines in the US.
 When I met its chief executive, Gary Kelly, in Texas in September, he said that low-cost carriers must keep finding 
new efficiencies, and keep driving costs down.
 So how is easyJet doing? Its biggest bill is airport charges, at £191m. But even though it has pulled out of Zurich 
airport, because it had become too expensive, it paid its airports an extra 28 per cent this year.
 And instead of copying the SouthWest model of using just one type of plane, easyJet is introducing a mix of 
Boeings and Airbus. That cost it an extra £6m as it sent staff on training courses and hired extra crew to cover.
 What's more, its fuel bill jumped by almost 22 per cent to £147m. While it can't do much about the oil price, it can 
protect itself by hedging. SouthWest has bought oil at a fixed price as far ahead as 2008. easyJet appears more 
vulnerable - it says that it will be "adversely affected" if the oil price doesn't fall quickly.
 Will it get better? Chief executive Ray Webster says that the rest of the winter will be "challenging", and 
competition "intense." Ryanair's chief, Michael O'Leary, has already promised a fares "bloodbath". easyJet says 
that it can't predict the fares it might charge, and warns that fuel prices and foreign exchange remain unknown 
factors.
 The corporate captain has left the 'fasten seat belt' sign on.

 At a time when the government is fighting off mass criticism about its plans to introduce 'super casinos' in the UK, 
Ryanair's boss, Michael O'Leary, has set his sights on turning his planes into gambling dens in the sky.
 Ryanair has already begun renting out portable terminals for passengers to watch TV programmes or films on their 
flights. On their introductory flight last Sunday, they were all rented out at a price of E7 per person. In total, 5,000 
are on order, and Ryanair expects the units to generate E14m in revenues over the next year.
This extra revenue stream is seen as a way of fighting back against the consistent yield declines that the business 
faces. A 20 per cent penetration rate at E7 per passenger will add E1.4 per journey leg. At present, the average 
fare per sector is E40 so, on these assumptions, the hand-held kit would add 3.5 per cent to average yields.
 Air Alaska is the only other operator hiring out the same equipment. It has managed a 40 per cent penetration, 
albeit on longer average journey lengths, which makes watching feature films more viable.
 But Ryanair's plans for generating more money out of its passengers won't stop there. "The next big step is 
gambling," says Mr O'Leary. "That is where we ultimately want to get to." Considering the high proportion of leisure 
traffic using Ryanair's services, it has a potentially large captive market.
 Lacking its own expertise in gaming, Ryanair would have to team up with an experienced operator, but that should 
be no problem. "We're beating the gambling operators back from the door," says Mr O'Leary. He says that, as long 
as Ryanair is in international airspace, there should be no legal barriers.
 The immediate obstacle to the plan is to get the hardware modified. The group is now trying to find a way of taking 
credit-card payments from passengers. Until that practical problem is overcome, the project will not be feasible.

Ryanair shares soar as capacity is filled

 Ryanair's shares surged 17 per cent this week as the Irish airline revealed that pricing pressure for the low-cost 
airlines is not as bad as had been feared. A 5 per cent decline in average yields in the first half of the year was at 
the bottom end of the expected 5-10 per cent range.
 Ryanair now expects declines over the winter of 5-10 per cent, compared with its previous guidance of 10-20 per 
cent. While chief executive Michael O'Leary still predicts a "bloodbath" this winter - and only expects to just about 
break even in the second half - the warning now rings slightly more hollow. Unsurprisingly, shares in easyJet, 
Ryanair's rival, also rose on the news, gaining a further 7 per cent to 171p.
While the lower average yield declines are welcome, they weren't entirely unexpected. Analysts have consistently 
said that they thought Ryanair was being overly pessimistic in its yield projections.
 If so, what accounts for the surging share price? "Up until today, it was a theory; as of today it becomes a fact," 
said Mike Powell, airlines analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.
 John Mattimoe, analyst at Irish stockbroker Merrion, agrees. "A key message today was that the risk associated 
with the stock has been reduced," he said. He expects earnings per share of 26 this year and 30 in 2005-06.
 The reason for this relatively benign operating environment, according to Ryanair, is that fuel surcharges imposed 
by flag-carriers such as British Airways, Lufthansa and KLM, are pushing more traffic than expected its way.
 But, while this is clearly a relief, it does little to address the longer-term problem in the industry of too much low-
cost capacity in the market. This capacity is only disappearing slowly. If, and when, the flag-carriers remove their 
fuel surcharges, Ryanair and easyJet will still face yield problems, albeit on lower average fuel prices.
 High fuel prices are the other big threat to Ryanair. Its fuel hedging position - at around $35 per barrel - runs out 
this month. And although there is some de facto hedging by buying weak US dollars in the futures market, most 
costs in excess of that will have to be taken as a straight hit to profits.
 Ryanair says $50 oil will add an extra E55m to costs each year, so the high 28 per cent net profit margins that the 
company enjoys are set to come under pressure. In the second half, Mr O'Leary says that Ryanair will only just 
break even.
Ryanair shares soar as capacity is filled
 Conditions aren't back to normal but they certainly seem better than they did. The rating looks high, but further 
forecast upgrades could come through. Good value.

 At some point, the student sometimes becomes the teacher. The US airline Southwest is the daddy of the budget 
carriers. It has been making a success of low-cost fares since the 1970s, and is the template for many of the 
world's no-frills operators. Michael O'Leary trekked to its Texas headquarters when Ryanair was just another full-
service airline, and came back possessed by a plan to cut costs and slash fares. What he learned there helped turn 
Ryanair into one of Europe's most profitable carriers.
Now Southwest is learning something from Ryanair. Driving past its home base, Dallas's Love Field airport, you 
can't miss Southwest's latest poster campaign, encouraging customers to check-in online. The internet is 
commonplace for air travellers in Europe. In the US, it's still the next new thing.
 But Southwest has fresh lessons to teach its newer acolytes - and its older, more established rivals such as 
American, United or Delta. The first is how to cope with soaring oil prices. With the cost of Brent Crude passing $50 
a barrel in London this week, and US Light Crude already beyond $53 a barrel on the New York markets, major 
airlines like BA and Virgin have put their fares up again. But low-fares rivals like Ryanair have not - they've copied 
Southwest by hedging their fuel costs. Of course, the big airlines hedge as well, but not to the same extent as 
Southwest. It has hedged some of its oil until well into 2008. During my recent trip to Texas, Southwest's new chief 
executive, Gary Kelly, told me that high oil prices would have wiped out his airline's entire profits in 2003, had it not 
bought so much in advance.
 The other lesson is a focus on keeping costs low. Most big airlines lose money. This once prompted Warren Buffet 
to say he would shoot the Wright brothers if he was able to go back in time. But Southwest has made a profit every 
year since 1973 by being prudent. Southwest's boss says that is why the company never planned to operate in 
Europe. Even though the success of Ryanair shows its low-cost model can be very successful over here, 
Southwest considered it a distraction. Mr Kelly says that finding new efficiencies is his constant priority. And it's a 
mantra Mr O'Leary echoes. But is it a message that easyJet - which faces the costs of two London headquarters, at 
Luton and Gatwick - holds close to its heart? Its recent series of profit warnings suggests that its grip on costs is not 
as tight as it might be.

 At first glance, easyJet's pre-close trading update was relatively benign, given the turbulence currently affecting the 
airline sector. Load factors in the high 80s, pre-tax profits at least 16 per cent up on 2003 and ongoing cost 
efficiencies aren't the sort of thing to send share prices into a tailspin. But they did. Put it all together, and the 
implication is that average fares are under more pressure than investors had thought - in an industry that is already 
beset by cut-throat competition. The shares sank to an all-time low.
What's more, easyJet's announcement that it would begin flying to Cork, Shannon and Knock was also unnerving. 
Ireland is Ryanair's home turf and it could react viciously to easyJet's moves by slashing prices further. Competition 
between the sector's two leaders has been limited in the past and the fact that they are now coming into closer 
contact could signal limitations on the expansion opportunities available elsewhere. EasyJet is cutting back capacity 
growth to mitigate its exposure to low fares - but not by as much as had been hoped for.
 VIEWS
 UBS Warburg
 Neutral. EasyJet's guidance implies that operating margins will be around 6 per cent this year, compared with 12 
per cent last year. If oil prices remain at current levels, easyJet would post a small operating loss in 2005. 
Rationalisation in the airline industry tends to be slow and the short and long-term earnings outlook is unclear.
 Credit Suisse First Boston
 Neutral. Earnings forecasts for 2005 have been slashed by 58 per cent to 5.4p due to lower yields and higher fuel 
prices. Pre-tax profits of £30.2m are now expected. The shares could drop as low as 100p over the winter as 
newsflow gets increasingly negative.
 Gerrard
 Outperform. Longer term, easyJet's business model should ensure that it is one of the winners in the European 
low-cost air-travel market. But investors have to be aware of the potential volatility in earnings forecasts and the 
high-risk nature of the stock. Wait for better news on ticket pricing and oil prices before buying.
EASYJET ( ESJ )
 The next few months are shaping up to be very difficult for easyJet, and its shares are likely to come under 
pressure. Although it has the financial strength to weather the onslaught of new entrants to the industry, you should 
sell now with a view to buying back later. Last IC view: High enough (142p, 27 August 2004).

 Never mind a lucky bet on the horses. If you want to make quick money, find a website that will sell you a Hilton 
hotel bedroom for less than the company's own price. The hotel giant is so keen to stop its business leaking away 
to independent travel websites, like Expedia, lastminute.com or ebookers, that it has launched a "best-price 
guarantee". Make a reservation through any of Hilton's websites, and it will give you a $50 cheque or refund if you 
find the same room for less on another website within 24 hours of booking. Hilton isn't the only hotel chain to try to 
buy back its customers' e-loyalty. Both Marriott and Radisson will knock 25 per cent off any cheaper rate located 
elsewhere. The super-luxury chains - Starwood and Westin - will give a 10 per cent discount, and so, too, will the 
Intercontinental group, owner of Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza.
In fact, Intercontinental has just made it more difficult to find a cheaper rate elsewhere. It announced this week that 
it will stop selling rooms on Expedia, the biggest virtual travel agency of them all. If you wanted to put a positive 
gloss on it, you could see this as a sign of recovery in the hospitality industry. Intermediate travel websites were just 
the ticket for hotel companies when they were desperate to fill their rooms in the wake of the 11 September 2001 
terrorist attacks. Now, the hotels are not as keen to take trade from any old vendor. Remember, the companies are 
not using discounts to poach us away from their hotel rivals - they're making sure that when we book one of their 
rooms, we do it on their websites.
 Not that there's anything new about travel companies refusing to have truck with the intermediate websites. Both 
Ryanair and easyJet have only ever sold their online tickets through their own internet pages. But airlines are small 
beer for the likes of lastminute.com or ebookers - there's not much profit in selling plane tickets. Their big money 
comes from hotel rooms and hire cars, where margins are fatter. So Intercontinental's decision raises a sticky 
question for the independent websites. They don't own rooms or resorts or cars.  They just sell other people's stuff. 
But if the suppliers won't offer them the goods at all, what's the point of them staying in the business?
 At ebookers, they seem fairly relaxed about the split between Intercontinental and Expedia. Rather than 
interpreting it as the hotel giants turning on all independent travel websites, chairman Dinesh Dhamija thinks that 
this is just Intercontinental clipping Expedia's wings, before it becomes dominant enough to dictate terms to the 
hotel groups. Lastminute, meanwhile, is stressing that it "has built on its relationship with Intercontinental" by 
signing new agreements with Hilton's European and British hotels, and with Radisson's Edwardian chain. It also 
says that it can carve out a whole new niche for itself by selling holiday add-ons - the bus tours, boat trips and 
romantic dinners that fill out even the shortest of mini-breaks.
With reservations
 But the split with Expedia is the last thing that lastminute's or ebookers' shareholders want to hear. They have 
already taken a beating on the stock market. Lastminute shares lost around one-third of their value in a single week 
after the company said that its profit margins were being squeezed, in part because it has to spend more to fight off 
an increasingly aggressive Expedia.
 News that two big shareholders, including a former executive, have sold its shares didn't help matters, either. 
ebookers, which has also stepped up its spending on marketing and new technology, has already disappointed its 
investors with half-a-dozen profit warnings and other cautious statements. Its shares have fallen by 70 per cent over 
the past year, though they perked up earlier this week when the company said that it had trimmed its half-yearly 
losses from £12m to £5m.
 Both companies forecast a better tomorrow. Mr Dhamija points to the explosion in online bookings in the US. 
There, 25 per cent of travel is already fixed over the internet, and that's forecast to rise to 65 per cent by the end of 
this decade. He hopes that there will be an even greater expansion in Europe, with online booking rising from the 
current 10 per cent of travel to 50 per cent. But how much of that growth will fall into the laps of ebookers and 
lastminute? If the hotels get their way - and their "best-price guarantees" do the trick - they may corner the lion's 
share, at the expense of the intermediaries.

 British Airways' (BA) first-quarter results, released this week, have prompted yet further heavy selling of its shares. 
The share price slumped 4.7 per cent as the UK's flag-carrier once again highlighted the tough trading conditions 
that it faces.
 The major new detail to emerge from the results was the increase in the fuel surcharge on long-haul flights from 
£2.50 per one-way leg to £6. It says that this should raise an extra £70m this year, which should largely cancel out 
higher fuel costs.
High fuel costs have become one of the biggest risks attached to BA. These results showed fuel and oil costs - BA's 
biggest outlay - rising 12.7 per cent to £258m in the first quarter. The airline now says that fuel costs will be £225m 
higher this year than last. It was previously banking on a hike of £150m.
 But the good news is that, according to the oil futures market, crude oil prices should start to drop from September, 
when a barrel of oil is expected to cost $41.28. The bad news is that the price isn't going to drop very quickly. In a 
year's time, a barrel will still cost $36.91. By implication, jet kerosene prices should follow a similar trend.
 So BA has upped its hedging on long-haul flights. It is now 72 per cent hedged at $32 per barrel for this year. The 
fuel surcharge should plug the gap.
 "It's interesting that they've only imposed the surcharge on long-haul flights. On long-haul flights, it should be pretty 
straightforward. The average business-class fare is probably about £1,000, so £6 is neither here nor there. And BA 
is seeing some tentative signs of pricing power in long-haul economy," said Mike Powell, aviation analyst at 
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.
 Confirming this, Virgin copied BA and also hiked its fuel surcharge.
 BA has not been able to impose a higher surcharge on short-haul routes, though. Passenger numbers in first- and 
business-class on short-haul flights are still low, and BA says that the non-premium markets remain highly price 
sensitive.
British Airways ' shares nosedive following fuel hike
 Overall, BA has been facing lower average fares. Yields in the first quarter are down 4.5 per cent on the first 
quarter of 2003. This is particularly disappointing because yields seemed to have turned the corner when BA 
reported in May that first-quarter yields were up 3.9 per cent.
 But, as the low-frills carriers Ryanair and easyJet have both made abundantly clear, the short-haul market is 
extremely competitive right now, so yields are likely to be forced down in Europe at least.
 "There's got to be a lot of bad news in the price at these levels," said Edward Legget, a fund manager at Standard 
Life, which owns 2.9 per cent of BA's shares. "But then again, you could have said that a couple of months ago 
when the oil price was $40. Now it's $45. It's difficult to see why there's going to be a lot of buying of the shares in 
the short term."
 And yet more bad news could emerge soon as BA confronts trade unions representing ground staff and 
administrative staff over a pay agreement. Its pay offer has been rejected and the Transport and General Workers 
Union (TGWU) has served notice of a strike ballot.
 Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive has a good record when it comes to labour relations, but there's a risk that, by 
not buying off the unions now, BA's longer-term cost-cutting programme will come under threat. BA says its plan to 
strip a further £300m from its wage bill is "a challenge - in particular given the current industrial relations 
environment". And what's more, BA may find itself boxed in and forced to come to some agreement as the peak 
August bank-holiday travel period approaches. Analysts estimate that a strike could cost BA £25m.
 Following the results, analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston cut earnings forecasts for the current year by 22.8 per 
cent to 17.8p and by 21 per cent to 20.5p for 2006.
 The challenges that BA faces are immense. While the shares aren't gripped by the same sense of crisis as before 
the Iraq war, conditions couldn't be much tougher. Barring a sharp fall in oil prices, the group is going to take a 
further hit on fuel next year, and it's hard to see the pricing pressures disappearing any time soon. The shares may 
look inexpensive, but forecasts could be cut again. High enough.

 Ryanair revealed this week that yield pressures are not as great as had been feared. Average fares fell by 6 per 
cent over the first quarter of this year, which is at the low end of the 5-10 per cent range that Ryanair had previously 
warned of.
Net margins were resilient at 18 per cent.
 Even so, Ryanair reiterated warnings that winter yields are likely to be 10 to 20 per cent down on last year. Making 
matters worse, it says its fuel price hedge will run out completely at the end of September, meaning it will be fully 
exposed to higher energy prices.
 These results were better than they might have been and Ryanair may be painting an overly bleak picture of the 
future. But, until there are signs that capacity is withdrawing from the market, the shares are high enough.

 Fresh from losing its battle with the European Commission, Ryanair has started a new legal battle against airports 
operator BAA. Ryanair is now suing BAA, alleging monopoly abuse of air levies at Stansted, the low-cost airline's 
most important base.
In turn, BAA is suing Ryanair for £1m in unpaid fuel bills.
 Analysts view the spat as a bargaining ploy ahead of the renegotiation of Ryanair's landing charges at Stansted. 
Upping the ante, Ryanair has also opened nine new routes from Luton airport, which is owned by TBI. It currently 
operates just 14 routes from Luton, but the move is an overt threat to BAA that Ryanair is willing to take its 
expansion away from Stansted if necessary.
 Ryanair's shares have dropped 7 per cent since the news broke. But although trading will remain tough this year, 
this does not look like a sign of a deeper financial crisis at the airline.

EasyJet shares dive on profit warning

 EasyJet's second profit warning in a month has caused widespread alarm in the City, and raised questions about 
just how attractive the low-cost airline model actually is.
 The shares, which crashed from 201p to 161p - their lowest level since flotation - have come under pressure 
because of "uncompetitive and unrealistic pricing" by competitors. Goldman Sachs cut its pre-tax profit forecast 
from £83m to £60.5m.
 Easyjet's warning mirrors those put out by Ryanair, the Irish no-frills carrier, this year. The volume of new entrants 
in the low-cost segment of the market seems particularly culpable.
EasyJet and Ryanair both reckon that they will see off the competition. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, 
talks enthusiastically of a "bloodbath" to come that will drive out the competition. But bath time may take a lot longer 
than he expects.
 While it's true that one start-up, Duo, went bust last month, and another, Now Airlines, this week deferred its launch 
indefinitely, it won't be easy for the established players to push the start-ups out of the market.
 Cheap financing is one thing that has attracted new entrants. The problem is that the leasing agreements they've 
signed can't be terminated easily. That acts as a barrier to exit, and means the new airlines are likely to go chasing 
volume simply to help cover their fixed costs. And this situation could persist.
 "This time last year, everyone was going on about the winter being a bloodbath, and yet most of (the new start-
ups) are still around," says one frustrated fund manager. "History would say that they don't disappear as fast as you 
would hope, or would seem logical."
 EasyJet and Ryanair also like to boast about their financial strength in relation to their competitors. And their 
finances are certainly healthy (Ryanair has £800m of cash on its balance sheet, and easyJet has £230m). But not 
all of their competitors are weaklings. Bmibaby, for example, is 30 per cent-backed by Lufthansa, the German flag 
carrier.
 Of course, neither easyJet nor Ryanair is above blame for the current mess. Both have also aggressively increased 
capacity, and there is more capacity growth to come.
EasyJet shares dive on profit warning
 Those programmes look set to be scaled back, though. Ryanair announced in January that it would reschedule 
aircraft deliveries. EasyJet said this week that capacity deployment in 2005 is now under review.
 All of this leads some analysts to question whether, in fact, the low-cost carriers are still a more attractive and 
faster growing business proposition than the full-service airlines.
 Over the past few years, the low-cost carriers have taken great pleasure in trouncing these 'high fares' airlines. 
Part of the attraction of the sector was that they were upstarts, and that it was easy to take market share from the 
big carriers. But it would be hard to characterise the sector as such now.
 In May, for example, Ryanair carried 2.17m passengers and easyJet carried 2.09m passengers. This compares 
with 2.05m passengers carried by British Airways in Europe over the same period. This means that they are less 
likely to be as insulated from industry-wide trends as they were before.
 Perhaps even more depressingly for investors in low-cost airlines, the high returns that they generated for 
shareholders in the past are now under pressure.
 As the chart (left) shows, airline analysts at UBS think that, although returns from Ryanair are still leading the 
European airline industry, returns from easyJet will be below those generated by British Airways. That makes the 
premium ratings that they have enjoyed hard to justify.
 "At the moment, it's worth bearing in mind that margins (among the low-cost carriers) are better than those for most 
of the network carriers. But margins are coming down, so it's a question of what happens to yields over the next few 
months," says a fund manager. "Until you get positive mood music from them, it's difficult to see why the shares are 
going to go up."
 Ryanair reports that summer bookings are reasonably firm, but that they're likely to be hit again in the winter. 
There's also the impact of high fuel prices to worry about. So, in the short to medium-term, at least, the mood music 
will remain blue.
 EasyJet and Ryanair will last the course and should offer good value for the longer term. But the problem of 
overcapacity could take much longer than expected to rectify. In the meantime, analysts could well keep 
downgrading forecasts as yields continue to weaken. Competitors look likely to keep pricing low, and that's likely to 
do the same to share prices.

 These results provided further proof, if any were needed, that the low-cost airline bubble has properly burst. As 
presented, the numbers don't look too bad. But it's Ryanair's performance in the fourth quarter that shows just how 
much pressure it faces. The airline sank into the red during the fourth quarter, making losses of E3.89m against 
profits of E48m a year earlier. The 14 per cent decline in average fares for the year as a whole is bad enough but, 
for the fourth quarter, the drop was 21 per cent. Still, at least it wasn't as bad as the 25-30 per cent decline warned 
of by chief executive Michael O'Leary back in January.
Summer bookings look decent enough but, beyond that, trading could get tougher still. The group's fuel exposure is 
fully hedged until the end of November. After that, high fuel prices will bite. At least this will probably force the 
market's new entrants out of business more quickly.

 Ryanair still has the financial strength to see off the competition. Trading may not improve immediately, but it 
should eventually pick up strongly. Currently trading on 16 times 2004-05's depressed forecast earnings, the shares

 The revelation that underlying sales of food at Marks and Spencer (M&S) have fallen for the first time in several 
years won't just have got them choking in the company's boardroom. As a major supplier of the retailer's foodstuffs 
- including sandwiches, ready-meals and biscuits - Northern Foods will also be feeling unsettled. Northern has 
already had its share of problems of late, issuing three profit warnings in the past couple of years. However, the 
food processor is set to reveal full-year earnings that are "broadly in line with expectations", which is quite 
something given its recent history.

The results will also give most investors their first taste of Patricia O'Driscoll, the company's new chief executive. 
She is likely to confirm the continuation of the cost-cutting programme that is already in progress. Shareholders will 
also be keen to hear the new boss's vision for achieving greater focus within the business, and how it is to achieve

 BT will once again hear ringing in its ears when Carphone Warehouse reports its full-year earnings next week. The

 The company's traditional mobile phone business will also reveal a strong recent performance. Sales of both pre-

 The economic week ahead
 Next week's biggest economic story is likely to be Friday's confirmation that the US economy is now definitely 
creating jobs. Economists expect non-farm payrolls to have risen 215,000 in May. This would be the third 
successive month of big gains.
 The chuntering classes will say that this is good news for President Bush. However, it could be bad news for 
investors, because it suggests that the 'sweet spot' of the economic cycle - in which output and profits grow without 
inflation - is largely behind us. Jobs growth is usually a lagging indicator.
 Other figures released next week will show that the US upswing is generating inflationary pressures. The Institute 
for Supply Management's (ISM) measure of prices paid by manufacturers for raw materials is likely to be close to its 
record high on Tuesday. This index has sometimes been a signal of turning points in inflation generally.
 Also, Friday's figures could show that wage inflation is picking up. Annual growth in hourly earnings is likely to be 2 
per cent, compared with just 1.6 per cent in February.
 What's more, there could be two signs that output growth is slowing down. The ISM survey on Tuesday, and 
factory orders on Thursday, might both show that growth is moderating.
Next week
 With growth slowing and employment rising, productivity growth will slow down. For this reason, Thursday's figures 
- showing output per person-hour in the business sector rising at an annual rate of an extraordinary 5.3 per cent - 
aren't quite as impressive as they seem.
 In the UK, meanwhile, we might get some mixed news about the consumer boom. M0 growth - which is correlated 
with retail sales - is likely to have fallen to its lowest rate since December 2000.
 However, Wednesday's figures will show that consumer borrowing is still growing strongly. And numbers from 
Nationwide and HBOS are likely to show that house prices are still rising strongly.
 Wednesday's numbers will also show that households' bank deposits are growing strongly - at an annual rate of 8 
per cent. This has been an overlooked factor behind the booms in house prices and spending.
 There'll be good news about manufacturing next week, too. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply is 
expected to report that output grew last month. This will deepen the conflict between strong surveys and downbeat 
official data about the sector.
 In the eurozone, the European Central Bank is expected to resist calls for lower interest rates at Thursday's 
meeting. Tuesday's numbers will show one reason for it to do so. They will reveal that GDP growth accelerated in 
the first quarter, and that purchasing managers report that manufacturing output grew this month.

 So petrol prices are going up again. One filling station I was at in south London now charges 81.5p a litre - steep 
for that part of town, but probably much less than many investors chronicle readers already pay, especially in rural 
communities, where forecourt prices are easily above 85p a litre.
 If you're muttering about the expense of putting a tiger in your tank, just think what it costs to fill up a Boeing 777. 
British Airways (BA) warned this week that its fuel bill will be £150m (just over 16 per cent) higher next year 
because aviation fuel is much more expensive - analysts say jet-fuel increases have far outstripped oil price hikes 
on the commodity markets. It's a major headache for the airlines - fuel is BA's second-biggest cost. The company 
has already acted to limit the financial damage by adding a £5 fuel surcharge to the cost of its return flights, and by 
bulk-buying more oil in advance at fixed prices. Around half of the fuel BA needs in the short term is now pegged at 
$28 a barrel, and the airline is hedging almost twice as much oil as it was a year ago. Despite all that, the 
company's chief executive, Rod Eddington, warned that he couldn't rule out further ticket price rises if the oil price 
stays close to $40 a barrel.
The fuel warning took attention away from BA's really big news: higher profits and lower debt. Pre-tax profits rose 
70 per cent last year to £230m. The figure is better than the City expected, because the carrier has trimmed more 
fat than it hoped. Cost-cuts have saved it £870m over two years, instead of the projected £650m. Routes have been 
dropped, planes have been mothballed, and just over 13,000 people are off the payroll - exactly what the company 
said it would do. Frequently, companies announce massive lay-offs to soothe investors, but then fail to wield the 
axe aggressively enough.
 Meanwhile, the company's borrowings have slimmed down to their lowest level in five years, cut by another £991m 
to £4.2bn. BA's debt mountain is now one-third smaller than it was at its peak, but £4.2bn is still an eye-watering 
IOU, and shareholders aren't getting a penny back in dividends until that figure falls still further - £3bn is Mr 
Eddington's new target.
 Profits up, debt down. Job done? Not quite. Aside from higher fuel costs and rising pension contributions, the 
airline faces another squeeze from the budget carriers. Ryanair's outspoken boss, Michael O'Leary, warned earlier 
this month that a new price war would lead to "blood all over the walls". Shortly afterwards, BA slashed fares on 38 
European routes by up to 30 per cent, even though its short-haul network has been bleeding heavily for years. It 
brings the cost of some BA flights to Naples and Prague down to £69, a figure "within touching distance" of the low-
Flight plan
cost carriers. BA warned this week that it will make less money per passenger this year, but has pledged to make 
up the difference by filling more seats on more flights.
 Here, the rise in fuel prices may - perversely - come to BA's aid. Insiders at the company fret privately about 
complacency. They fear the massive cost savings already achieved will make managers, workers and trade unions 
think that the hard graft has been done. But getting the airline's finances to take off is one thing, keeping them on 
the flight path is another, possibly more difficult, task. Workers may be more willing to accept cuts and lay-offs when 
the company appears to be knocking on death's door. It's much more difficult to persuade them that the cuts need 
to continue when profits are up and fortunes appear to have revived. As the budget airlines have shown, though, 
the need to keep costs down is never-ending. It's a message Ryanair drummed home to its staff in April, when it 
threatened a pay freeze for all 2,300 workers (it eventually granted a backdated rise of 3 per cent a few weeks 
later).
 BA now appears to be sending a similar message to its staff and investors. The company's chairman, Lord 
Marshall, ended his official comments this week with a caution: "The continuing focus on controllable costs remains 
key to long-term profitability." The spectre of dearer oil, and warnings from BA and Sir Richard Branson that some 
well-known airlines could go bust this summer as a result, could restrict any opposition from staff to further cuts. It 
could also make it easier to persuade shareholders to go without their dividend.

 "If you see a bandwagon, it's too late", remarked Sir JAMES Goldsmith, famously. He should have added that, if 
you're an investor, it's also best to get out of the way. The success of Ryanair and easyJet has led to a flood of 
copycat rivals and this is taking its toll on the marketplace, pushing already low fares even lower.
This prompted a profit warning from easyJet last week, which followed a similar warning from Ryanair - its first ever 
- in February. Last month, chief executive Michael O'Leary, reiterated his view that market conditions would be 
"awful" this year and pledged to keep fares low to make things even tougher for the new no-frills upstarts. This 
could force some out of business and put the low-cost sector back onto a steadier financial footing.
 This situation wasn't helped by Ryanair's plans to add heavily to capacity. It has now, however, decided to take 
delivery of its new aircraft later than originally planned and this should help take some of the pressure off pricing. 
Ryanair still expects fares to fall by between 5 and 20 per cent this year.

 Add. Although margins could remain under pressure in the long term, market expectations for yields this year still 
look low, and upward earnings revisions should boost the share price. New bases - at Rome and Girona - should 
prove more successful than the ones set up last year. In the longer term, Ryanair will continue to face cost 
pressures.

 Hold. While the medium- to long-term strategic position of Ryanair still looks favourable, there's a short-term lack of 
visibility on passenger yields. Expect underlying pre-tax profits for the year to March 2004 of E237m, giving EPS of 
28.4. Trading is expected to weaken in 2005 to give pre-tax profits of E220m and EPS of 26.

 Underperform. Yields are the most important driver of Ryanair's earnings, and remain the key uncertainty going 
forward. Ryanair's choice of aircraft and destinations could have eroded its pricing power. The share price target is 
E4.42.

 Although these numbers were better than analysts' forecasts, easyJet's shares still nosedived 25 per cent on the 
day they were released as the market was spooked by the company's recent trading figures. Management told the 
City that unsustainably low prices from competitors had knocked average fares by 5 per cent and had resulted in 
easyJet's planes carrying 3 per cent fewer passengers in April.
Ultimately, though, easyJet and Ryanair should see off the competition, as both airlines have very healthy balance 
sheets and can afford a protracted price war.
 And the results themselves were good. Most interestingly, they showed that the introduction of the new Airbus 
A319 planes into easyJet's Boeing fleet had not hiked costs. Costs per available seat per kilometre held steady at 
4.17p. But what could hit costs hard is the higher oil price - easyJet doesn't hedge its fuel price exposure - and the 
strengthening dollar.
 Goldman Sachs has cut earnings forecasts from 18.1p in 2004 to 14.6p. For 2005, it forecasts EPS of 15.7p

 The news was disappointing, especially since easyJet had previously claimed it wasn't being affected by the tough

 Just over a year since its first profit warning, low-fares airline easyJet has hit the City with another. Its shares fell 22 
per cent, to 227p, as it said that tough competition from new start-ups has hit both fares (down 5 per cent), and the 
number of seats that it has been able to fill (down 3 per cent).
It follows a profit warning from its competitor Ryanair in January, which the Irish airline blamed on similar factors. At 
the time, easyJet was keen to distance itself from Ryanair's problems, and said that it was "cautiously optimistic" 
about the future. Duo, one of the new carriers blamed by easyJet and Ryanair for their troubles, went bust this 
week.
 Despite these problems, easyJet, like Ryanair, has enough financial firepower to blast the new upstarts out of the 
skies. The shares are still good value for the long term.

 So even Rolls-Royce can produce a cracking set of results. If this one-time object of scorn can do it, what does it 
say about the wider sector? Does it mean other commercial aerospace companies must also now be in recovery 
mode?
 At first glance, the answer is yes. The aerospace and defence sector is up 10 per cent on last week. Since Rolls-
Royce's results last Thursday, Meggitt's shares are up 7 per cent, Cobham's are up 4.4 per cent and Smiths' have 
gained 2.2 per cent. Is this because orders are reappearing as passengers return to air travel?
No it isn't, says Aviation Strategy, an aviation consultancy. It argues that, while 2003 may have looked like the order 
cycle's trough, two months into 2004, it remains difficult to see where the next aeroplane orders will come from.
 Low-cost carriers have dominated orders for the past two years, but even the mega-bullish Michael O'Leary, chief 
executive of Ryanair, has effectively admitted that he's piled on new capacity too quickly. He's now pushing back 
his own schedule for new aeroplane deliveries.
 What's more, Aviation Strategy says 1,300 perfectly decent, usable aircraft remain parked in the Arizona desert - 
500 of which will return to use over the next two years. That leaves even Rolls-Royce's forecast of an upturn in 
2005 looking optimistic. Rolls' own strong performance has been driven by good aftermarket sales, not new orders.
 So we must look elsewhere to explain the rising share prices in the aerospace and defence sector. Actually, the 
sector's gains are nothing new. After a weak start to the year, it has gradually risen up the leader board of the stock 
market's best-performing sectors.
 That's probably down to the steady 'defence' part of the sector, not its exposure to commercial aerospace. 
Investors are gradually rediscovering the attractions of steady companies and this is the main reason for the 
sector's strong showing. Ultimately, Rolls-Royce's results will probably only be marginal to a continuing strong 
sector performance.

 No-frills airline easyJet has unveiled strong traffic figures, in stark contrast to those of Ryanair a week earlier. 
January traffic rose 12.3 per cent on last year and the airline filled 77 per cent of its seats.
It remains "cautiously optimistic" about its performance this year.
 This is a reversal of the situation last March, when Ryanair was clearly doing better than easyJet. But since then, 
easyJet has since cut back its capacity growth from 33 per cent to a target of 20 per cent, while Ryanair's has 
increased. easyJet also said it supports the European Commission's decision to clamp down on selective discounts 
from state-owned airports. This, the company says, is "supportive of the low-cost airline industry".
 ICView - This was the best way for easyJet to signal that its problems are behind it, and that it is avoiding the 
turbulence that is affecting Ryanair. We advised buying at 263p last November and, even after the rise to 336p, the 
shares aren't expensive. Good value.

 Every now and again, the City gets into a complete tizzy. Tantrums are thrown. Share prices are smashed against 
the wall. Last week, the no-frills airline Ryanair lost more than a quarter of its value in a single day. That followed a 
warning that profits will be lower than expected this year, and the European Commission was about to ban 
subsidies Ryanair had received for flying to Belgium's Charleroi airport.
 It didn't take the City long to do a loop-the-loop. When the European Commission finally adjudicated this week, it 
ordered Ryanair to repay millions of pounds' worth of handouts. But the airline's shares jumped by more than 6 per 
cent. Having made a fuss the previous week about the £11m it might have to repay at a single airport, Ryanair 
appeared to get off lightly with a likely bill of just £3m. That didn't halt the vociferous denunciations from its colourful 
chief executive, Michael O'Leary. He called it "a shocking decision, reversing 20 years of competition in Europe", 
and warned ticket prices may have to rise, or routes shut down.
Some of you may wonder why the subsidies were judged illegal. After all, the money transformed an airstrip in a 
rundown part of Belgium into a Continental hub. Previous attempts to run regular services to London had flopped. 
Now, with the subsidies, Ryanair flies to a dozen destinations, including London, Stockholm, Barcelona and Rome. 
The airline's arrival at Charleroi created 1,800 jobs, and injected nearly £30m into the local economy. investors 
chronicle reader Alastair Hill asks: "Isn't this a 'win-win' situation?" He sent me an e-mail, making a stout defence of 
Ryanair's Belgian subsidies. "Surely in a competitive free market, the best negotiator gets the best deal? If you 
were buying a car, you'd negotiate a discount, or at the very least get a free tank of petrol."
 The European Commission insists its decision "promotes the activities of low-cost airlines and regional 
development". So I forwarded Alastair's e-mail to the Commission's London office, requesting why Charleroi can't 
give its number one customer a discount just like a car salesman. The Commission thinks no car salesman would 
be as generous as Charleroi. It gave Ryanair reduced landing fees, discounts on airport services, money towards 
marketing and promotion, reimbursements for pilot training and help with its hotel bills. The total package came to 
£10m. Without state backing, argues the Commission, this sort of sweetener would not have been affordable - and 
no private airfield could have risked offering it.
 But isn't that the point of state aid - using a little sugar to make viable the initially unviable? What, asks Alastair, is 
the difference between a state-run airport in a rundown area using subsidies to drum up business, and a 
government using taxpayers' money to bring a factory to a deprived region?
Ryanair - hot air
 The competition watchdogs say they don't have a problem with either of those things. They say Charleroi can 
continue to offer financial help for new services - and Ryanair can keep the money it received in the past for its 
innovations. Their problem is that the handouts kept on coming. Charleroi offered Ryanair valuable perks that no 
other airline enjoyed, and had agreed to pay out for up to 15 years. In one case, it was even paying new money for 
an old service that had been launched years before. It looked like Ryanair was getting help with its day-to-day 
operational costs, not a start-up boost.
 The Eurocrats say that if Charleroi - or any other state-owned airport - is doling out spoonfuls of honey, it should 
dole them out to everyone. It should offer the same incentives to all the airlines that want them, linked to new routes 
and limited to five years. The Commission says that the new, level playing field will encourage more cut-price 
flights, not scare off the existing budget carriers. Ryanair says the ruling is "a disaster for the low-cost travel 
industry".
 Its rivals disagree. Sir Richard Branson's no-frills operation, Virgin Express, says it will "redress the balance of fair 
competition". And competition lawyers, such as Alex Potter at law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, say you 
could now see more airports offering more new deals. "Whether or not you agree with the rules, the Commission 
has set down a framework, and if you know what the rule is, you can operate within it," he says. Much as Ryanair 
hates it, some experts think this week's ruling could be the making - not the breaking - of cheap travel.

 British Airways launched another assault on its bloated cost base last week, announcing plans to make £300m of 
cost savings by 2006. These savings come on top of the £450m it will have saved by March under its 'Future Size 
and Shape' restructuring programme.
 As with that programme, the burden of cost-cuts will fall on employees. Up to 3,000 are expected to go, probably 
through voluntary redundancy and early retirement. Working practices are also being addressed - BA wants to 
reduce absenteeism from an average of 15 days per employee each year. That could prove difficult to achieve. The 
wildcat strikes at Heathrow last summer indicate that staff appear to be fed up. They have already seen 13,000 
employees lose their jobs since 2002.
The ultimate objective of the scheme is to secure operating margins of 10 per cent over the course of the economic 
cycle. That was the aim of 'Future Size and Shape', but conditions in the industry have been so poor that BA is 
having to go further than it had previously thought necessary in order to achieve these goals. The group's third-
quarter results are due out on 9 February.
 VIEWs
 CHARLES STANLEY
 Short-term hold. Assuming that revenues continue to improve and that BA hits its cost-saving targets, 10 per cent 
profit margins should be achievable. But, given BA's susceptibility to outside events and the tough competition, 
highlighted by Ryanair's profit warning, reaching its previous peak earnings levels could prove a challenge. 
Forecasts are difficult to make at the moment but, for now, expect pre-tax profits of £185m (EPS of 9p) in 2004, 
rising to £360m (EPS of 30p) in 2005.
 BNP PARIBAS
 Outperform. The cost-reduction programme is gradually achieving its targets and the revenue outlook is positive. 
Particularly encouraging is the tendency towards higher numbers of premium-fare passengers. This latest round of 
cost savings will probably be mainly in back-office functions. Although there has been employee unrest at BA, more 
problems seem unlikely as the changes will be for the long term. BA will probably introduce them slowly and expend 
a lot of effort on making sure they are accepted.
BRITISH AIRWAYS ( BAY )
 ICView - The shares have had a strong run and now reflect very bullish growth forecasts. But, despite the 
improving economic backdrop, economic and geopolitical risks remain. Fairly priced. Last IC view: High enough

Double trouble hits Ryanair

 Investors in Ryanair received two crushing blows this week, sending shares in the Irish low-cost airline into tailspin. 
The shares slumped 27 per cent to E5.1 as Ryanair predicted that a European Commission ruling into illegal state 
aid would find against it, and then, a day later, warned that profits would not match analysts' forecasts.
 The European Commission investigation into subsidies at Ryanair's Belgian hub at Charleroi has been hanging 
over the airline for more than two years. The investigation will determine whether discounts that Ryanair receives 
for flying there should be classified as subsidies that are not permitted under European law.
Ryanair claims it was told on Monday that the Commission would find against it; that discounts from such publicly-
owned airports, which account for 18 per cent of Ryanair's European traffic, would not be allowed in future; and that 
discounts at European airports that receive an element of public subsidy would also be banned. The final restriction 
could cover almost all of Ryanair's airports.
 "We've never paid a full price (to fly to an airport)," admits Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive. So the 
implications are potentially enormous.
 For a start, Ryanair could find itself paying back the subsidies it has received from Charleroi. Mr O'Leary says that 
these could be as much as E15m. It also sets a precedent for similar claims at other airports around Europe, which 
could cost up to E100m.
 Admittedly, that's not much for a company with E1.1bn of cash on its balance sheet.
 But more importantly, the decision could also force Ryanair to withdraw from some well-established and profitable 
routes, as it did with Strasbourg last year. It could also force the company to raise prices, although Mr O'Leary says 
that will not happen for at least the next year.
 Raising prices without getting any improvement in margins is the last thing that Ryanair needs at a time when it is 
struggling to fill the planes it already owns, let alone the planes it has on order. Mr O'Leary says that January traffic 
figures, which are not yet published, will show that Ryanair only filled 70 per cent of its available seats, compared 
with 76 per cent last January.
Double trouble hits Ryanair
 "There's seat-dumping everywhere," he said, adding that "forward bookings look bloody awful". He blames 
increased competition from loss-making low-cost start-ups, as well as lower prices from flag-carriers such as British 
Airways. With capacity growing at over 20 per cent a year, Ryanair is cutting average fares by 25-30 per cent in the 
current quarter to fill its seats and it expects fare declines of 5-20 per cent thereafter.
 The decline in fares has forced Ryanair to issue its first profits warning since floating in 1997. It has been made all 
the more painful because, just three months ago, Ryanair had been confident about the outlook. "We did say 
previously that margins weren't sustainable," says Mr O'Leary. "But we didn't think they'd come down this bloody 
quickly." Mr O'Leary agrees that this could all give the impression of a company out of control.
 In response, Ryanair is deferring the delivery of some new Boeing 737s to ensure that capacity growth becomes 
more manageable.
 Ryanair now thinks net income will be E215m this year, compared with E239m last year, a 10 per cent drop. This is 
down to yield decline - as competition intensifies and capacity grows - and the weakening of sterling against the 
euro.
 For an airline that has prided itself on maintaining industry-beating margins, this week's bad news spells trouble. 
"We could be looking at margins of under 20 per cent," says Mr O'Leary. "They could conceivably be under 10 per 
cent."
 Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein have cut pre-tax profit forecasts for this year from E267m to E195m, 
and for next year from E317m to E230m.
 Low-cost rival easyJet is keen to disassociate itself from Ryanair's problems. An easyJet spokesman said that the 
company remains cautiously optimistic for this year, despite its 20-25 per cent capacity growth, and is unfazed by 
any adverse ruling from the European Commission. "Our view is that this is a pretty Ryanair-specific issue and the 
deals we do with airports are not dependent on government subsidy," he said. Nevertheless, easyJet's shares 
dropped 25p to 331p on the news.
 ICView - Ryanair's briefing in Brussels was unofficial and the airline won't name its source, so don't assume 
Armageddon just yet. More worrying are the trading problems, which could last for a long time as new, loss-making 
start-ups continue to enter the market. High enough.

 Ensuring a good flight takes meticulous preparation and easyJet has evidently done its groundwork well. Over the 
past couple of years, the low-cost airline has successfully acquired rival Go and combined it with its own business, 
while also buying a fleet of new Airbus aircraft. And despite this big jump in total capacity, easyJet managed to keep 
its flights full last year. Now, the company's earnings look set for take-off.
Assuming that the economy continues to strengthen over the coming months, then demand for air travel should 
steadily increase. Besides leading to fuller planes, this should also help stem last year's decline in average ticket 
prices. Together, these developments could fatten easyJet's profit margin from 9 per cent to around 10 per cent. As 
in previous years, the main risks are slowing economic growth and the threat of terrorism.
 But, on a longer-term view, the airline's prospects look attractive and there are still plenty of potential European 
passengers yet to take a low-cost flight. easyJet's strong market positioning and brand name should allow it to 
capitalise on this.
 VIEWs
 DAVY STOCKBROKERS
 Buy. Seasonal factors have traditionally meant a net loss in the first half for easyJet, but this deficit promises to 
shrink by over half this year. The improved economic environment, as well as issues such as positive cost 
movements, should support this process. easyJet's shares deserve to trade on 16 times forecast EPS of 24.8p for 
2004, suggesting a share price target of 400p. That would still represent a 20 per cent discount to the broker's 
estimate of Ryanair's fair value.
 CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON
 Outperform. Around 30 per cent of easyJet's costs are denominated in US dollars and, as the airline has no dollar 
revenues, it should be a direct beneficiary of the recent weakening in the US currency against sterling. Over the 
coming year, the number of passengers carried by the airline should increase by almost 22 per cent to 24.7m. And, 
given that management won't have to deal with some of the distractions of recent years - such as the Airbus order 
or the Go deal - there's a good chance of efficiency gains.
EASYJET ( EZJ )
 ICView - We suggested buying easyJet's shares at 263p last November and, in the short time since, they have 
risen 42 per cent. But that's still not expensive given the long-term outlook. Keep buying. Last IC view: Buy (263p, 
28 November 2003).

 Shares in the aviation sector, notably those of British Airways and BAA, perked up as soon as hostilities started in 
Iraq last year. As it became apparent that the world wasn't heading for Armageddon after all, their prices were 
propelled upwards in relief.
 Combine that with a forecast traffic recovery as the world economy came out of the doldrums, and the tonic was 
potent enough to lift British Airways' shares from 86p in March to 249p in November.
And that recovery has continued into this year, following strong December traffic figures from BA.
 BAA has fared less well, partly because it possesses some utility-like characteristics and is not as operationally 
geared as its airline counterparts. But a favourable regulatory settlement last year, combined with good progress in 
building Heathrow's fifth terminal, should mean that the shares are pushed higher again this year.
 Low-cost airlines like easyJet and Ryanair should also continue to perform well. However, the European 
Commission is currently investigating the legality of Ryanair's low landing charge arrangement at Belgium's 
Charleroi airport. An adverse ruling could scupper the ability of low-cost airlines, particularly Ryanair, to secure a 
range of favourable landing charge arrangements.
 This year, the public transport operators will be awarded - and start operating - new rail franchises. Just before 
Christmas, the Strategic Rail Authority awarded National Express the new Greater Anglia franchise ahead of the 
Firstgroup-owned incumbent, GB Railways. Firstgroup will take over Thames Trains for two years from the end of 
next year, though. That's probably in preparation for taking on the merged Thames Trains-Great Western franchise 
in 2006.
 The ports operators should continue to experience volume growth as world trade expands. That will be important 
for P&O, which has interests in the Chinese market.

 Shares in aviation companies have enjoyed a fantastic run this month as the City has taken heart from the 
gathering pace of the sector's recovery. Leading the way, shares in British Airways and easyJet have both gained 
over 25 per cent since the start of January as both companies reported strong traffic figures.
British Airways reported a 4.8 per cent increase in passenger traffic in December. Crucially, this was helped by 4.7 
per cent growth in high-yielding premium traffic. This compares with 2.5 per cent in November, and just 0.5 per cent 
in September.
 The positive numbers led to a rash of large earnings upgrades, with analysts expecting the recovery to accelerate. 
BNP Paribas, for example, now forecasts EPS of 3.53p this year (up from the previous forecast of a 0.73p loss), 
and 13.6p in 2004-05 (up from 3.8p).
 Low-cost carrier easyJet, meanwhile, revealed that it carried 16 per cent more traffic in December than a year 
earlier, and that it had also improved load factors. Credit Suisse First Boston upgraded its target price for the shares 
from 310p to 372p.
 Ryanair shares rose only marginally, though, despite strong traffic figures. Risks remain that a European Union 
(EU) investigation into illegal state aid will prove damaging to the airline. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, 
said last week that he still understands that the EU's draft decision is negative.
 Low-cost airline strength was largely responsible for good traffic figures from airports operator BAA. Its shares 
moved up to 514p, their highest level in a year.
 ICView - The aviation sector is recovering well, and we're positive about the prospects for BAA and easyJet, in 
particular. However, with the likelihood of further geopolitical problems never far away, tread carefully.

 A few weeks ago (3 October), I referred to the list of "15 points to look for in a common stock" drawn up by investor 
Philip Fisher. His list is a gold standard, not always accessible to common or garden types such as you and me - 
take, for example, Fisher's instruction to assess "How good are the company's cost analysis and accounting 
controls?" You will only get an accurate answer after said controls have blown up. So with apologies to Philip 
Fisher, I here set out my own framework for gauging the quality of a company. When assessing a prospective 
investment, I always take five minutes to score the company between one and five on the following dimensions of 
quality.
 nSector: Is this a prosperous sector or not? Growth in demand is part of it, but by no means all. Airlines are not a 
prosperous sector - Ryanair would score '0' under this heading. I'd say non-life insurance scores pretty low, too. 
High-scoring sectors include luxury goods and simple, low-cost, everyday services. PHS and Rentokil make 
shocking amounts of money by servicing company washrooms. The answer isn't always crystal clear. Retailing, per 
se, is one I am never too sure about - I'd probably assign a retailer '3'. But I would first ask whether I could define a 
narrower sector.
nManagement: There are two issues: "Are they any good?", on which you shouldn't have the confidence to give a 
high score unless they have a four or five-year record at the company in question; and "Will they honestly report the 
company's progress to you?" Again, only time tells. Sometimes, this question helps: "Are these managers keen to 
become stock market heroes?" If the answer is yes, the score is low.
 nMargin on sales: Does the company make 30 per cent on sales or 3 per cent? Although the true determinant of a 
great investment is profit as a percentage of capital employed, rather than profit as a percentage of sales, profit 
margins do count. High-quality media companies should, by definition, make fat margins. But bear in mind that 
profit margins can fall if they are not readily defendable.
 nTrack record: The easiest of the lot. You can leave the management out of this - just look at the company's 
earnings-per-share record and its share price progress over five or 10 years.
 nProspects: I mean long-term prospects over four to five years - not this year's profit forecast. This one is very 
difficult. I never give out a '5' here. If the prospects of the company and its sector are difficult to work out, face the 
facts.
Building a measure of company quality
 nBalance sheet: This one is easy and, somewhat unconventionally, I advise you to approach it through the profit-
and-loss account rather than the balance sheet itself. Try this question: "How many times is interest covered by 
operating profits excluding genuinely unusual items?" If you have a few extra minutes, answer this question, too: 
"How many times are interest and fixed- charge items, such as rents, covered by operating profit excluding these 
items?" This is known as fixed-charge cover. If the answer is over 10 times cover, score it '5'. If the answer is under 
two, the score will probably be '0', unless the company's revenue stream is unusually stable.
 nSimplicity: "Does this look like a simple business to run?" Very few companies score highly here, and those that 
are unlikely to do so include large companies (anything in the FTSE 100) and multi-divisional companies. High-
scoring companies probably do just one thing. Simple businesses are attractive for two reasons: they should be 
easier to run and they should be easier for the investor to appraise. I think Hornby - as in model railways and 
Scalextric - is probably a fairly easy business to run compared with many others. You could probably say the same 
about most small breweries.
 nMarket share: I am sure you agree that companies that dominate their markets have certain attractions. Think in 
terms of 'relative market share' because often that angle - how big the company is compared with its biggest 
competitors - gives you better insight. If A has 30 per cent and B has 25 per cent and C has 20 per cent, none of 
them are going to score highly. But relative market share needs interpretation. A company with 12 per cent market 
share whose biggest rival has only 6 per cent is not a high scorer.
 The maximum score is '39', because no-one scores '5' for prospects. If you're looking at a company scoring '30' or 
more, you're probably looking at a high-quality company. But not necessarily an attractive investment. Because you 
need to buy it cheaply, too.

 owning property abroad has become the new national pastime. For years we've been snapping up properties all 
over the world for use as holiday or retirement homes. And now we're increasingly buying properties as 
investments, not for our own enjoyment, but as buy-to-let back-ups for our pension funds.
 But jumping in to this market feet first - confident that if it doesn't work out as planned, we can just sell up and walk 
away with a handsome profit - is the kind of lazy thinking that got many investors into trouble during the big bubble 
of 1999 to 2001.
Investing in overseas property is a perfectly sensible idea but, if it's to work, you need to do your research and plan 
a route around problems you are likely to encounter, including language barriers, ignorance of local laws and taxes, 
and exchange rate fluctuations.
 And besides finding the property of your dreams, you'll also need to find professionals whom you can trust to carry 
out your instructions and lead you through the whole process.
 Planning is vital
 Buying property abroad as an investment is similar to buying a buy-to-let flat or house in the UK. You should know 
exactly what your target market is, and how well your chosen property will meet their needs. And if you want a 
rental income all year round, you must choose the location with great care. A ski resort, for example, will not attract 
tourists for 12 months of the year, but an apartment in Tenerife probably will. For a high income to cover all your 
costs, your property will have to be attractive, and offer everything the renter wants, such as a great location.
 The most popular countries for investors are the top holiday destinations: France, Spain, Florida and other parts of 
the US, Portugal and Italy. Properties in these hot spots tend to have appreciated in value, prompting new investors 
to buy cheap homes in former holiday destinations, such as Dubrovnik, or other emerging destinations, such as 
Turkey, Goa and Egypt.
 The easier it is to get to your house, the easier it will be to let. Most estate agents advise a distance of no more 
than an hour's drive from an airport. However, if you're going to rely on low-cost budget airlines, remember that 
flights can be withdrawn - as Ryanair is now threatening to do on some routes.
Pastures new
 The proximity of your home to a tourist attraction, or a part of the countryside renowned for its beauty, a stretch of 
coastline, a major city such as Paris, or a beach, will determine how many holidaymakers beat a path to your door.
 Be realistic about yields
 Estate agents are the same whatever language they speak. A yield of 7.5 per cent may not be achievable in reality, 
and you should check the going rates for similar properties to see if the yields being quoted are feasible. The capital 
gains figures also quoted may not be realistic, either.
 Remember you will have to deduct expenses for a managing agent if you are employing one, or your own 
expenses finding a flow of tenants if you do not, plus cleaning and general maintenance. If interest rates go up, the 
cost of your mortgage will also rise, thereby eating into your margins.
 Let someone else do the work
 The time and effort required to manage your own rental property from the UK can be significant, so it's often easier 
to let someone else do the work for you. Use a reputable agent who is a member of a recognised association.
 Spain is a popular choice for those who plan to retire to their overseas property in later years, and is still a favourite 
with holidaymakers. Many developers now offer purchasers a deal whereby you buy the apartment and thereafter 
they supply you with a rental income minus costs. Often you will be allocated a few weeks each year for your own 
personal use.
 And while buying 'off plan' can save you money, don't forget that developers can run out of money, too.
 FOREIGN TAXES
 Familiarise yourself with local fees and taxes as these will eat into your projected returns. In France, for example, 
you will have to pay stamp duty of 5 per cent of the purchase price - or around 1 per cent on new properties plus 
VAT of 19.6 per cent - plus, in addition to legal fees, you will have to pay the Notary's fees (notaries handle all the 
conveyancing paperwork), which will be based on the cost of the property. According to tax experts Deloitte and 
Touche, there are also three annual taxes, including a 'wealth tax' that applies if you own assets in excess of 
E720,000, which property owners must pay regardless of whether they are resident or not, and whether the 
property is owned through a corporate structure.
 Rental income is taxable, of course, but if a double taxation agreement exists with the country in which you've 
bought a property, you will not have to pay tax twice. Rental income is taxed at a minimum of 25 per cent for a non-
resident in France, however you can deduct similar expenses to those allowed on buy-to-let properties in the UK. If 
the property is owned through a corporate structure, tax is charged at French corporation tax rates, which are 
higher still. In Spain, you are obliged to complete a tax return every year, declaring any income you have received 
from your property and, even if you do not rent out the property, you will have to pay tax on a notional income.
 You will also be faced with a tax bill when you sell the property. But long-term gains are subject to a reduced rate 
of tax in France, so if you hold the property for 22 years the disposal will be tax-free.
 Inheritance laws are tricky to negotiate, too - you may have to set up a 'societe civile immobiliere' to acquire the 
property to avoid French succession law restrictions, but this, warns Deloitte and Touche, can create income and 
capital gains tax complications. It fears that the Inland Revenue will use a recent ruling to target UK individuals who 
own overseas property via overseas companies, and says the potential tax liabilities could amount to £5,000 on a 
£300,000 home.

 These results should pacify some of Ryanair's harsher critics. While it's true that fares are falling, the 12 per cent 
decline compares with City estimates of around 14 per cent.
And in the second quarter, the fall was only 10 per cent. This drop is partly because of sterling's weakness, and 
partly a consequence of Ryanair's rapid expansion. The other consequence of the airline's expansion has been a 
lower load factor. However, the 5 per cent first-half decline was in line with the airline's previous estimates, and 
could improve as the board looks to jettison underperforming routes. Net margins remain healthy at just over 28 per 
cent.
 Ryanair wants to finance more of its planes on operating leases, rather than owning them outright. This should 
improve cash flows and its return on capital.  The short-term risk is a negative ruling from the European 
Commission, investigating potentially unfair subsidies being received by Ryanair for flying to Charleroi airport in 
Belgium. A ruling against Ryanair could force backdated subsidy repayments of around £8m, and is expected later 
this month. Analysts expect full-year EPS around 35 (24p last year) this year, rising to 42 (29p) in 2005.

 Forgive me for going celestial, but the metaphor is compelling. On Sunday, astronomers announced the discovery 
of the Lynx Arc - "the biggest, brightest and hottest star-forming region ever seen in space". Apparently, a useful 
benchmark is the Orion Nebula, a pretty big beast in cosmological terms.  Orion is powered by four huge stars. 
Lynx contains a million such stars. This weighty phenomenon is 12bn light years away, so you don't need to worry 
about it.
 On the black hole front, next week is the first anniversary of the Hubble telescope's discovery in our very own 
galaxy of a flying black hole approaching Earth at 250,000 miles an hour. Don't fret - it's still 8,000 light years away.
But worry and fret all you like about their terrestrial parallels. Subtract 12bn from Lynx and trim 8,000 from the flying 
black hole, and you should have some appreciation for the dangers posed to investors and everybody else by 
China's incipient manufacturing supremacy, and the US trade deficit.
 While you and I are searching out good investment value by appraising ICI's earnings prospects, Ryanair's price-
earnings ratio and whatever, these two stupendous forces could make our efforts utterly irrelevant. Allow me 
another metaphor: we are focusing on wormcasts, but a tsunami and an earthquake are around the next two 
corners.
 There is, of course, nothing new about either China's manufacturing supremacy or the US trade deficit. They've 
both been creeping up on us for 20 years. We are used to a thousand UK manufacturing jobs a day decamping to 
China. Even high-priced quintessentially English products are heading there. This year, Doctor Marten transferred 
all his boot production to China. Wedgwood transferred just its cheap stuff, but one look at its recent results will put 
you in no doubt that its core brands will be off there soon. It's not just that China is cheaper, although that is indeed 
a big part of it: skilled production labour earns $1 an hour. More importantly, China is finer. Having researched and 
written several pieces on the subject in recent years, I have no doubt that it is easier to get a quality product from a 
Chinese factory than a Western one.
 I hope I am not telling you anything you did not know. And, of course, you know this, too: now, administrative jobs 
are migrating to India at the same speed. Last week, Lloyds Bank owned up to moving 1,000 jobs there. But can 
you believe it does not envisage moving another 20,000 there in the foreseeable future? China and India: 1.5bn 
people keen to do your work for a $1 an hour: the biggest, brightest and hottest job-forming region ever seen on 
earth.
The giant star & the black hole
 Meanwhile, the US trade deficit is in its third age. Can you remember the second age in the late 1980s, when the 
US trade deficit suddenly zoomed up to 3 per cent of gross domestic output? Put another way, the US was 
spending 103 per cent of its income, and building up a mortgage to the rest of the world in order to do so.
 Between 1980 and 1990, this process resulted in US net international investment (that is all the US-owned foreign 
assets built up throughout history, minus all the foreign holdings of US assets) moving from plus $400bn to minus 
$300bn.
 The deficit problem went away for a few years, but it has been back big-time since the mid-1990s. Now, the US is 
spending 105 per cent of its income, and US net international investment stands at minus $2.5 trillion.
 This cannot go on. According to a pretty doomladen analysis of the problem by Warren Buffett in this week's 
Fortune magazine, the US as a nation is about 5 per cent geared (having, in 1980, been - this is my guess - 10 per 
cent ungeared) and its debt ratio is worsening at one percentage point of the nation's wealth a year. This could go 
on for five years, and maybe 20, but no more. The trend has to reverse (Warren Buffett's article proposes how to 
start the process. But I fear this kind of problem only goes to the mender after an acute crisis. The dollar will touch 
20p before George Bush or his successor reaches for the Buffett plan).
 And at some point in those same 20 years, the last manufacturing job in the West will be sucked into China. And 
the last transferable service job in the West will be taken up keenly by an Indian graduate on $1 an hour.
 What should investors do about this? I will return to this subject as soon as I have the answer.

 78p - aviation services - You would be hard-pushed to call Alpha Airports lucky. The group, which runs airport retail 
concessions and provides in-flight catering services, was hit by the end of intra-European Union duty-free in 1999. 
Then, in 2001, Tamil Tiger separatists bombed Sri-Lanka's Colombo airport, where Alpha has retailing interests. 
And, like everyone else in the aviation industry, Alpha has suffered during the traffic slump prompted by the World 
Trade Center attacks and the war in Iraq.
 The good news, though, is that Alpha's luck may be changing. First, air traffic seems to be recovering. Last month, 
the UK's biggest airports operator, BAA, reported that July was its second-busiest month ever. That echoed bullish 
reports from elsewhere in the aviation industry.
Such an increase in passenger numbers will push more customers through Alpha's retail outlets, which are already 
recovering after the abolition of duty-free. Following a rebranding exercise aimed at overcoming customer 
confusion, the signs coming from this retail business are positive. At its annual meeting in May, Alpha said that UK 
retail sales were up 13 per cent on last year. This is being driven not only by increased footfall in its shops, but also 
by squeezing more money out of each customer - up around 4 per cent, year on year.
 The recovery in traffic should help Alpha's in-flight catering business as the cut-backs, imposed by airlines 
struggling to survive, come to an end. Still, we shouldn't overstate the upside here - around 90 per cent of Alpha's 
in-flight business is geared towards short-haul European traffic, which never really suffered from the downturn. The 
trend that hit it hardest was the market share gains made by low-cost carriers over full-service carriers in Europe. 
Full-service airlines, such as British Airways, used to lavish Alpha with money for on-board meals. No-frill 
competitors, such as easyJet and Ryanair, don't.
 Alpha has, at least, managed to work with the low-cost carriers, providing pay-as-you-eat meals and in-flight 
retailing services. This exposes the company to the sector's rapid 25 per cent-a-year traffic growth. The problem is 
that deals with the budget airlines aren't as lucrative - they operate on profit-sharing agreements and, of course, not 
all passengers want to buy a meal.
 So profits are down. On continuing operations, profits last year in the in-flight business slipped 10 per cent to 
£15.7m. The good news is that the worst now seems to be over. Even Alpha's own broker, Panmure, estimates 
that, from now on, revenue gains from the low-cost airline market should more than offset any lost income from the 
full-service carriers, resulting in a recovery in profits at the flight services division from this year onwards.
ALPHA AIRPORTS (AAP)
 So the outlook, barring any unforeseeable incidents, looks clearer for Alpha than it has for some time. Panmure's 
forecasts reflect this. It expects the group's underlying pre-tax profits to bottom at £21.4m this financial year, before 
climbing to £26m in two years' time. These forecasts exclude the £2.9m charge for amortising goodwill reflected in 
the figures in our table.
 Profits could still rise further if the company makes acquisitions. Alpha is generating stacks of cash and 
management wants it to expand overseas. Kevin Abbott, chief executive, says that no deals have been done so far 
because the right opportunity just hasn't come along. If no clear takeover candidates do emerge, then management 
could easily afford to return cash to shareholders, given that Alpha has almost no borrowings.
 This robust financial position, and the encouraging signs of recovery, have pushed Alpha's share price up to a five-
year high since March. But, trading on just 11 times forecast underlying earnings for this year - and underpinned by 
a healthy dividend yield - the shares are hardly expensive. This recovery story has further to go. Buy.

 Ryanair could be forced off its Strasbourg-London route by a French court ruling that prohibits publicly-owned 
Strasbourg Airport from subsidising Ryanair's activities. But the low-cost airline says disputes like this, over state 
aid from airports, won't hold back growth.
The company also faces an European Union investigation in Belgium, because of a similar agreement with 
Charleroi Airport. Chief executive Michael O'Leary says that if he cannot strike such deals in the future, Ryanair 
may only fly to privately-owned airports.
 Mr O'Leary also unveiled the company's first-quarter results, showing sluggish EPS growth of 12 per cent - the 
result of new route launches and the integration of Buzz. However, he dismissed a new Irish competitor, FreshAer, 
as "a bunch of nutters with 757s," ruling out retaliation as it would be "like mocking the afflicted."
 ICView - Plenty of expansion opportunities remain, and sluggish growth is down to rapid capacity expansion, to be 
reined-in next year. But the rating is still punchy. Fairly priced.

 Despite heavy share sales by founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, shares in easyJet continued their ascent this week 
after it released strong traffic figures. Like-for-like traffic grew 13.5 per cent and load factors remained strong at 85.8 
per cent.
The shares hit 249p against a June low of 163p, as optimism continues that this months trading statement will be 
more positive than expected. Optimism also persists about British Airways, which says traffic is improving after a 
severe dent early this year.
 But Ryanair shares dropped 20p to 402p as it revealed a 9 per cent fall in the proportion of seats filled in June. 
That shouldnt be too much of a worry - many of its routes are new and it has a good record of maturing them 
quickly.
 IC VIEW
 The outlook for the airline sector is better than it was three months ago and Ryanairs problems shouldnt prove too 
much of a drag.

 Were all going on a summer holiday - and thats according to the tour operating industry, rather than Sir Cliff 
Richard. In recent weeks, leading players in the sector have experienced a surge in demand for package holidays 
for the crucial summer period. The recovery follows a nasty dip in bookings during the Iraq war. This sunnier 
outlook will come as great relief to investors in the industry, especially given its poor track record of profitability and 
the lack of decent returns.
 Overall, though, the number of holidays sold by the tour operators is actually down on last year. TUI - the German 
firm that owns Thomson - recently announced that the number of packages booked was down by around 12.6 per 
cent. In the case of MyTravel, the shortfall to date is 5 per cent, while bookings within First Choices UK mass-
market business are down 2 per cent. Brokers believe these firms are unlikely to make up the difference for the 
year.
In itself, that isnt necessarily a bad thing. Its partly a reflection of the fact that there are fewer packages on sale. 
Because the Iraq war was clearly on the cards for some time beforehand, the tour operators foresaw the likely fall-
off in demand and reduced their capacity. For example, MyTravel has cut its offering of packages by 12 per cent 
across its various operations. The result is that it is selling fewer holidays, but at a higher average price.
 All this is a far cry from what has happened in previous years. Tour companies have either overestimated demand 
or tried to grab business from rivals, by flooding the market with tens of thousands of bargain holidays at the last 
minute. These price wars have predictably had a devastating effect on the holiday firms profits. And the only 
winners have been consumers, who have got their fortnight in the sun for a song.
 Although improved industry discipline is a very welcome development, balancing supply and demand isnt the only 
issue for the tour operators. The advent of the internet and the boom in low-cost airline travel has opened up a 
world of possibilities for consumers. Booking flights and accommodation directly over the internet can be much 
cheaper than buying a traditional package holiday. And since the internet has made prices and availability more 
visible, the public is often prepared to wait until the last minute to book.
 These arent theoretical challenges. The number of people booking flights with budget airlines really is rocketing. 
Ryanair recently began the sale of a million rock-bottom fares for the peak summer period. So the tour operators 
need to act if they are to stay in the game. Trying to add value by offering more specialised trips is one strategy, 
Post-war boom for the travel sector
and seems to be working for First Choice. Ultimately, though, the sector will probably need further consolidation. 
Theres now a stronger case than ever for the big four players becoming three.
 IC VIEW
 Shares in travel firms have had a bumpy ride lately and further turbulence is very likely. As a destination for 
investors, the sector is only for the adventurous right now.
 MARGINS ON THE UP AT FIRST CHOICE
 First Choice knows how to handle itself during difficult times. The firm endured the aftermath of 11 September 
much better than its struggling rival MyTravel. It took swift action to cut its costs and its offering of holidays. And it 
has got it right once again this year. As expected, the absolute number of bookings taken has fallen. But the 
average selling prices are up, which is boosting profit margins.
 As with all tour operators, First Choice always makes a seasonal loss in the first half of the year. Thats because the 
business incurs heavy costs during that period, while the key summer selling period falls in the second half. And 
with a slowdown in sales around the Iraq war, losses in its UK mainstream business widened from £34.1m to 
£37.8m. But, elsewhere, there were some very encouraging trends. In particular, the firms Canadian operation 
rebounded to a £4.1m profit from losses of £1.5m last year.
 Given the 7 per cent hike in the dividend, First Choices management is evidently confident about the outlook. The 
firms balance sheet is still pretty robust, with net cash of £14.3m. That leaves it in an excellent position to make 
further niche acquisitions, building up its strength in the specialist holiday market. Deutsche Bank is forecasting full-
year EPS of 8.4p, rising to 10.4p in 2004.
 IC VIEW
 First Choice is without doubt the sectors quality play. But the shares have risen strongly in recent weeks and now 
reflect much of the companys recovery potential. High enough for now.

 IC VIEW
 Shares in travel firms have had a bumpy ride lately and further turbulence is very likely. As a destination for 
investors, the sector is only for the adventurous right now.
 MARGINS ON THE UP AT FIRST CHOICE
 First Choice knows how to handle itself during difficult times. The firm endured the aftermath of 11 September 
much better than its struggling rival MyTravel. It took swift action to cut its costs and its offering of holidays. And it 
has got it right once again this year. As expected, the absolute number of bookings taken has fallen. But the 
average selling prices are up, which is boosting profit margins.
 As with all tour operators, First Choice always makes a seasonal loss in the first half of the year. Thats because the 
business incurs heavy costs during that period, while the key summer selling period falls in the second half. And 
with a slowdown in sales around the Iraq war, losses in its UK mainstream business widened from £34.1m to 
£37.8m. But, elsewhere, there were some very encouraging trends. In particular, the firms Canadian operation 
rebounded to a £4.1m profit from losses of £1.5m last year.
 Given the 7 per cent hike in the dividend, First Choices management is evidently confident about the outlook. The 
firms balance sheet is still pretty robust, with net cash of £14.3m. That leaves it in an excellent position to make 
further niche acquisitions, building up its strength in the specialist holiday market. Deutsche Bank is forecasting full-
year EPS of 8.4p, rising to 10.4p in 2004.
 IC VIEW
 First Choice is without doubt the sectors quality play. But the shares have risen strongly in recent weeks and now 
reflect much of the companys recovery potential. High enough for now.

 <Text> Were all going on a summer holiday and thats according to the tour operating industry, rather than Sir Cliff 
Richard. In recent weeks, leading players in the sector have experienced a surge in demand for package holidays 
for the crucial summer period. The recovery follows a nasty dip in bookings during the Iraq war. This sunnier 
outlook will come as great relief to investors in the industry, especially given its poor track record of profitability and 
the lack of decent returns.
 Overall, though, the number of holidays sold by the tour operators is actually down on last year. TUI the German 
firm that owns Thomson recently announced that the number of packages booked was down by around 12.6 per 
cent. In the case of MyTravel, the shortfall to date is 5 per cent, while bookings within First Choices UK mass-
market business are down 2 per cent. Brokers believe these firms are unlikely to make up the difference for the 
year.
In itself, that isnt necessarily a bad thing. Its partly a reflection of the fact that there are fewer packages on sale. 
Because the Iraq war was clearly on the cards for some time beforehand, the tour operators foresaw the likely fall-
off in demand and reduced their capacity. For example, MyTravel has cut its offering of packages by 12 per cent 
across its various operations. The result is that it is selling fewer holidays, but at a higher average price.
 All this is a far cry from what has happened in previous years. Tour companies have either overestimated demand 
or tried to grab business from rivals, by flooding the market with tens of thousands of bargain holidays at the last 
minute. These price wars have predictably had a devastating effect on the holiday firms profits. And the only 
winners have been consumers, who have got their fortnight in the sun for a song.
 Although improved industry discipline is a very welcome development, balancing supply and demand isnt the only

 Ryanairs management want you to forget whatever youve heard on Watchdog. It says that Ryanairs flights are the 
most punctual of any European airline and proportionally fewer of its passengers bags go missing than those 
unfortunate souls who fly with the upmarket carriers. While Ryanairs claims may raise a few cynical eyebrows, 
there is less room for scepticism when it comes to the Irish low-cost airlines financial record. The firm has 
established itself as the leading budget carrier in Europe and its profitability is enough to make competitors reach 
for their sick bags in envy.
To report record earnings in a year when the rest of the industry is struggling with the effects of the Gulf War, Sars 
and economic downturn is, indeed, impressive. Its a testament to Ryanairs adherence to the budget airline 
business model pioneered by Southwest in the US. While rival easyJet has moved away from its low-cost roots and 
now operates out of some prime destinations, Ryanair has stuck with lesser-known airports and bargain fares.
 Because fares are so low, Ryanairs planes take to the air with few empty seats. The average load factor last year 
rose from 81 to 84 per cent. And because costs didnt rise as fast as ticket sales, the firm saw profit margins 
improve as well, from 24 to 28 per cent. That was despite a fall in average fares and higher fuel costs. But 
management stresses that the fat profit margins achieved this year wont be sustainable and that theyll shift back 
towards the firms target level of nearer 20 per cent.
 This relates to Ryanairs recent acquisition of fellow low-cost carrier Buzz.  In order to fill all its extra capacity, the 
firm is slashing prices yet again.  As a result, passenger numbers could jump by more than a half, from their current 
level of 15.7m a year. But the extent of the discounts is jangling investors nerves, sending the shares 10 per cent 
lower to 400p on these results. Ryanair is dumping 1m bargain-basement fares on the market for the three peak 
months of summer. At the same time, the firm is facing pressure from a weaker pound and an EU investigation into 
its relationship with Brussels Charleroi airport.
 Given Ryanairs record of delivering impressive results and its highly-rated shares, the market can react harshly to 
any unfavourable news. While passenger and profit growth should continue at a rate other airlines can only dream 
about, it may not be enough to keep the share price in the clouds. Merrill Lynch forecasts 2004 pre-tax profits of 
E299.5m and EPS of 35.

Lower fares push down easyJet profits

 EasyJet proved that even low-cost airlines are mortal this week when it unveiled disappointing first-half results. As 
expected, the no-frills carrier slipped into a £46m operating loss against profits of £4m last year. More worrying is 
the longer-term outlook as revenue pressures intensify.
 The drop into the red resulted from lower average fares, which were 10.7 per cent down overall. Aeroplanes were 
fuller - load factors increased by 1.1 percentage points - but only on the back of heavier promotions.
Yields recovered in April as the Gulf War ended and easyJet benefited from a late Easter. But dont expect a 
permanent recovery. The company says that it expects continued pressure on fares in the second half, that forward 
bookings for June are weak, and that revenue visibility over the rest of the year is low.
 A particular worry is that easyJet wont be able to absorb all the extra capacity it has coming on stream, which will 
hit yields further still. easyJet operates 68 Boeing 737s, but 10 more are due to be delivered by next May. On top of 
that, it has ordered 120 Airbus A319s to be delivered by September 2007.
 "We see a direct inverse correlation between the strength of our growth rates and yields," says Chris Walton, 
easyJets finance director."We have a 25 per cent annual growth profile of aircraft, but that will be much more 
measured (than what has gone before)."
 In the first half of this year, capacity expanded by 40 per cent.
 While revenues are under pressure, Mr Walton says that easyJet has cut unit costs by 8 per cent. Flying to main 
airports, rather than Ryanair-style outposts, has left the company more exposed to rising landing and ground-
handling charges. But it has saved on maintenance, crewing and insurance costs. Analysts expect full-year pre-tax 
profits of around £70m, giving EPS of around 13p.
 Separately, British Airways also released passenger figures this week. Its shares jumped 7 per cent to 145p as it 
revealed that passenger numbers in April were down just 2 per cent - an improvement on the 11.4 per cent drop 
recorded in March.
 While creditable, this headline number masks a deteriorating passenger mix: premium-first and business-class 
traffic fell 26.4 per cent last month, but standard-class traffic improved 2.4 per cent. While overall traffic growth is 
Lower fares push down easyJet profits
likely to return when the scares over terrorism and Sars recede, the traffic mix is likely to remain poor as long as the 
economic downturn persists.
 ebookers rides out travel turbulence
 While the airlines have been under pressure, online travel agent ebookers is riding out the turbulence in the global 
travel market well. First-quarter results this week showed the company moving into profit for the first time, despite 
an estimated cost of £3m-£4m from the war in Iraq.
 Demand has remained strong, with organic revenue growth of 42 per cent, but much of the benefit has come from 
cost-cutting. Ebookers relocated its call centres to India last year and is saving more than £1m per quarter. The 
next challenge is Sars - potentially damaging because ebookers specialises in flights to Australasia.
 "Its less predictable than the war," said Nigel Addison Smith, the companys finance director,"but Id be surprised if 
its as damaging."
 He reckons that, at worst, ebookers profits will suffer a £3m hit. House broker Beeson Gregory forecasts pre-tax 
profits of £12m-£14m this year, giving EPS of 17.4p-24p, depending largely on how long the Sars problems 
continue.
 These are good results and if the Sars outbreak doesnt linger, growth should continue. As long as consumer 
spending holds up, the shares still dont look too expensive. Good value.

 Budget airline Ryanair has sealed the takeover of low-cost rival Buzz at a knockdown price. The Irish airline finally 
bought Buzz from Dutch carrier KLM for E20.1m (£13.8m) following due diligence.
It had previously agreed to pay E23.9m. In exchange, it will take 10 aeroplanes, 130 employees, and landing slots 
for 12 routes. After hitting Buzz with some tough-to-swallow cost cuts, Michael OLeary, Ryanairs chief executive, 
now thinks that it will be profitable from its relaunch on 1 May. Buzz already has 100,000 passengers booked to fly 
during May and another 400,000 during the summer.
 Ryanair and KLM still havent secured takeover approval from the Office of Fair Trading or the Civil Aviation 
Authority because they were keen to push the deal through quickly. Regulatory problems arent anticipated.
 IC VIEW
 It may be unpleasant, but Michael OLearys big stick approach to Buzz should be reassuring for Ryanairs 
shareholders. This deal looks attractive but, trading on 17 times forecast earnings, the shares are fairly priced.

Early termination of easyJets option to buy Deutsche BA, British Airways German subsidiary, cheered up investors 
in the low-cost carrier this week. The shares surged 14 per cent to 229p.
The City had been concerned that easyJet would saddle itself with a lot more risk while still integrating its 
acquisition of Go, the low-cost rival bought last year, and fighting pressure onits prices.
EasyJet wanted to buy Deutsche BA to establish a foothold in Germany. Carrying out exclusive due diligence on 
Deutsche BA has cost (GBP) 6.2m in payments to British Airways. But easyJet has walked away, citing rigid 
German labour lawsand aggressive pricing by German flag-carrier Lufthansa.
Irish no-frills airline Ryanair, trading successfully in Germany, bid auf weidersehen saying"when the going gets 
tough, easyJet gets going". easyJet says it will look for other entry points to Germany.Joe Thomas

Try to figure this one out. There are two budget airlines listed in London, both growing like the clappers despite the 
risks of terrorist attacks, and both with brands that are now household names. So why does one, Ryanair, have a 
share price thats still up in the clouds, while shares in the other, easyJet, have had a nasty stall?
The reason is that these two businesses differ a lot more than you might think. Although their brands have become 
virtually synonymous with cheap flightssince they stormed the European airline market in the 1990s, their business 
models are actually diverging.
The first clue comes from their choice of destinations. While easyJet flies to premier league airports like Paris 
Charles de Gaulle, Madrid Barajas and Venices Marco Polo, Ryanair is keener on the lesser-known likes of Aarhus, 
Ancona and Alghero. When it does fly to established destinations, it normally chooses second-tier airports. For 
example, its Frankfurt flight terminates at Hahn, a former US fighter base 60 miles away from the city.
The choice of different routes and airports has several knock-on effects. While more established routes are a safer 
target (you know that the traffic is there), flying to primary airports costs much more in landing charges (see chart, 
right, for a breakdown of the airlines costs). Flying to bigger and more congested airports also makes easyJet 
slower than Ryanair at shuttling planes back and forth.
It also means that its routes tend to attract different sorts of customers and arouse different responses from 
competitors. The routes less travelled that Ryanair goes for often have little, or no, effective competition, in clear 
contrast to easyJet.
Until now, that hasnt been a problem for easyJet - a lean organisation up against bloated national carriers who 
largely ignored the low-cost threat. But, worried by the erosion of their market shares, the old-guard airlines have 
started to fight back by lowering fares, sometimes down to no-frill levels.
EasyJet revealed late last month that average fares were 6 per cent down on last year, and warned that they could 
fall further. Its shares duly tumbled. Though its hard to be sure, this drop in yields could be down to renewed 
competition from the full-service carriers.
The City was particularly unsettled because easyJet had previously shown a trend of increasing fares. Ironically, 
investors dont seem to mind that Ryanair is constantly cutting prices. Indeed, it makes a virtue of it.
Off to a flier
This is because easyJets fixed costs - like landing charges - are higher, so there is more of an operational gearing 
effect when it adjusts fares.
"Ultimately, the impact of a 1 per cent increase or decrease in fares is much greater for easyJet than Ryanair," says 
Gert Zonneveld, a transport analyst at WestLB Panmure. And if you compare the two firms operating margins - 26 
per centat Ryanair, 13 per cent at easyJet - you can see which company has the most breathing space.
Then there are the aeroplanes. Both groups spotted an opportunity to buy new aircraft on the cheap in the big 
aviation slump that followed the 11 September terrorist attacks. Each secured big discounts from the 
manufacturers, desperate for work at a time when no one else was buying airplanes. But while Ryanair matched its 
existing fleet by choosing Boeing 737s, easyJet plumped for Airbus A319s. It will now have a mixed fleet of Boeings 
and Airbuses.
To the low-cost purists, it marks a big difference. The conventional wisdom has been to maintain a fleet of the same 
aircraft types. That way, the theory goes, the fleet is easier to maintain and run, keeping costs low. Its what 
Southwest Airlines, the American pioneer in the field, has done successfully forthe past 32 years.
Of course, easyJet has given good reasons for its decision. The deal came at a knockdown price and easyJet says 
the offer from Airbus was,"significantly better than the offer from Boeing". It also reckons that using Airbus jets will 
cut its unit costs by around 10 per cent.
Despite all this, the Citys unease remains, contributing to easyJets shaky share price. Investors are unlikely to give 
the firm the benefit of the doubt until the airline delivers clear proof through its financial results.
There are other differences in the two companies strategies, like their approach to acquisitions (see box) and 
easyJets policy of not hedging its fuel exposure while Ryanair covers itself almost completely. At this stage, the City 
is firmly behind Ryanair. Its strategy is simpler than easyJets and its a provenwinner in the US.
But problems could emerge for Ryanair in a big consumer slowdown, which is when its dependence on leisure 
traffic could really show through. The British publics appetite for weekend breaks cannot grow forever. Meanwhile, 
easyJet would benefit if business passengers trade down from the full-service airlines. And its not obvious how long 
the higher-cost carriers can keep competing on price.
On 11 times 2004 earnings, easyJets shares are cheap. But it has a tough time ahead and a lot to prove. Trading 
could get worse, which would force analysts todowngrade their forecasts again. Ryanair looks a safer bet, with a 
more straightforward strategy - but, on 18 times next years earnings, this is in the share price already. At a time of 
uncertainty for the airline industry generally, its shares are too expensive to chase.
Land grab in the skies
In the past year, both easyJet and Ryanair have veered away from the path of organic growth by buying out smaller 
rivals in a bid to grab market share. Ryanair took Buzz off KLMs hands and easyJet snapped up Go.
Even in these deals, there are contrasts in their approach. While easyJet will integrate Go with the existing 
business, Ryanair is content to keep Buzz atarms length. Ryanair chief executive Michael OLeary says that he 
plans to use Buzz as a subcontractor for his airline. The real prize within Buzz was access to its landing slots, 
particularly at the increasingly full Stansted Airport.
Theres also a difference in tone from the management teams. Ryanairs tough approach to Buzz and its staff 
contrasts with easyJets more conciliatory approach at Go. Around two-thirds of Buzzs staff face the axe and Mr 
OLeary saysthat, if the rest dont play the game his way, hell shut down the airline. Its anabrasive approach but one 
that has pacified the City, reassured that Ryanair wont be blown off course by integration issues.
Ryanair looks unlikely to do another deal, preferring to concentrate instead on organic growth from now on. But 
easyJet may well buy British Airways German subsidiary, Deutsche BA. It has already bought an option to take over

the business and must make its mind up in the summer. Should it decide to take the plunge, the shares could fall 
further as the City gets to grips with a whole newset of risks.

 EasyJet warned investors this week that average fares would be lower than the City had expected. The low-cost 
airline said that fares in the four months to January were 6 per cent below last year because it tried to increase the 
number of seats being filled by Go, the low-cost rival that it bought last year.
EasyJet's shares fell 14 per cent to 213p.
 EasyJet's problems seem to be worsening. It indicated that, for the half-year to March, average fares would 
probably be down by around 8 per cent - the same as recently reported by Ryanair. Analysts at BNP Paribas cut 
full-year EPS forecasts by 9 per cent to 18.5p. EasyJet isn't as capable of absorbing lower fares as Ryanair 
because it has higher costs - the result of flying to more popular airports.
 IC VIEW
 The scale of fare reductions was surprising, vindicating the critics of last year's Go acquisition. But the deal still 
makes long-term strategic sense and, on a forward PE of 12, the shares are worth holding on to.

Europes low-cost airline industry has taken its second major step to consolidation with the acquisition of KLM-
owned Buzz by Irish carrier, Ryanair. The deal unsettled the City as the planned takeover marks a departure from 
the groups previous organic growth strategy. Uncertainties over easyJets acquisition of Go last year have pushed 
easyJets share price lower.
But there is merit in the deal. Ryanair buys slots at its existing base at Stansted, which are increasingly difficult to 
obtain as the airport fills up. And sharing bases with Buzz adds to economies of scale as well as providing 
opportunities to launch new routes and increase frequencies.
And the deal is cheap. Ryanair could have waited for the loss-making Buzz to fold naturally before picking up the 
pieces, but a gross price tag of (GBP) 16m hardly stretches a company with net cash of (GBP) 44m.
Integration shouldnt be too tough either, as Ryanair plans to leave Buzz as a separate firm, effectively a sub-
contractor, rather than integrate it fully intoits business as easyJet is doing with Go.
But integration wont be quite as straightforward as Ryanair chief executive Michael OLeary claims. Buzz, unlike 
Ryanair, will remain unionised, and unions like the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) are unlikely to take job 
cuts of 20 per cent lying down. Labour unrest has a history of wreaking havoc inthe airline industry and could 
scupper the deal.
But Mr OLeary is taking no prisoners."For those that dont want to sign on to the programme, the door is over there," 
he said."If Balpa want to go on strike on 1 April, it wont be a case of sacking them, well just close down Buzz." By 
closing Buzz, Ryanair would keep the landing slots but lose the troublesome staff.
The success of Ryanairs plan depends on cutting unprofitable routes, shedding staff and doubling the carriers traffic 
to 4m passengers this year, thereby pushing Buzz into the black. Analysts at Merrill Lynch estimate that Buzzs 
losses are 12 per cent of Ryanairs profits. So any slippage could force analyststo downgrade their Ryanair 
forecasts. For such a highly-rated airline, the impact on credibility would be massive.
"They cannot afford to let this drag on," says Gert Zonneveld, transport analyst at WestLB Panmure. But he says"I 
dont think we should be looking at profit warnings. It wont reach that stage as theyll shut Buzz down. Ryanair is 
playing a very hard game at the moment."
Ryanair deal unsettles investors
The Buzz deal is the second major takeover in the low-cost sector, dividing Europe between Ryanair and easyJet. 
Consolidation had been expected for some time but, as Mr OLeary puts it, the concept of low-cost travel"is 
spreading likea virus over Europe", and that has tempted new entrants into the market. Tour operators have been 
particularly keen to get in to stop market share erosion.
But dont expect any more takeovers just yet. Many budget airlines are just not big enough to hit the radar of the big 
players, and their viability is not assured. One Scandinavian player has already gone bust and, given the problems 
in the rest of its business, MyTravels commitment to its airline MyTraveLite is questionable. Even easyJet, which 
has taken an option to buy British Airways Deutsche BA subsidiary, is believed to be getting cold feet.
Ryanair plays down war risks
Ryanair also published impressive third-quarter results this week, in marked contrast to the gloomy news from 
elsewhere in the sector.
Although revenue growth for the nine months to December slowed to 37 per cent, good cost-control meant that 
profits still advanced 45 per cent to E47.8m.Growth should continue - January traffic figures showed passenger 
growth of 55 per cent - and advanced bookings from the new base at Milan Bergamo indicate that around four-fifths 
of all seats offered will be filled.
The main risk is war. Mr OLeary says hes"not hugely concerned" as advanced bookings are good. And fuel looks 
well hedged at 20 per cent below spot prices for the rest of the year. But even he admits that there could be 
problems if wardrags on or leads to more terrorism.
IC VIEW
The shares have fallen back recently, but still trade on a demanding forward PE of 21. The Buzz deal looks decent 
and these financial results were excellent.But, with the uncertainties of war ahead, the shares are fairly priced.

Ryanair selects Swedish hub

Body
Budget airline Ryanair put the latest plank in its European expansion strategy this week, selecting Stockholms 
Skavsta airport as its sixth European hub. Ryanair plans to begin flying from there to eight other European cities 
from 4 April.
The choice of base looks sensible as Scandinavia is one of the less developed areas on the European low-cost 
airline map and is seen as a high-fare market.
Skavsta airport, which had been loss-making until the first half of this year, is owned by UK airports operator TBI."I 
think this is a marginally positive move for them," said Andy Murphy, transport analyst at WestLB Panmure, 
cautious that Ryanair is likely to have struck a very hard bargain. He thinks profit forecasts for TBI are only likely to 
edge up 4 to 5 per cent. TBIs share price didnt budge.
IC VIEW
The deal is unlikely to be a big catalyst for TBIs shares which, together with Ryanair shares, may come under short-
term pressure as worries escalate about war in the Gulf.
