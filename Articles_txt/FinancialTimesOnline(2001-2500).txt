Ryanair has swung from a record loss to one of the largest profits made by any airline during last year's economic 
downturn.
The Dublin-based airline says it will pay a one-off dividend of EUR500m, or EUR0.34 per share, in October - a year 
earlier than expected - as it forecasts profits would rise further this year.
"We can be proud of delivering a 200 per cent increase in profits and traffic growth during a global recession when 
many of our competitors have announced losses or cutbacks, while more have gone bankrupt," said Ryanair chief 
executive, Michael O'Leary.
He added that he expected higher yields, or average fares, would offset increased fuel and other operating costs in 
the coming year, meaning profits should rise by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent, to a range of around 
EUR350m ($426m, £295m) to EUR375m.
In contrast to full-service flag carriers such as British Airways or Air France-KLM, which have both reported large 
losses recently, Ryanair made a pre-tax profit of EUR341m in in the 12 months to the end of March.
The figure is a sharp improvement on the pre-tax loss of EUR180.5m Ryanair recorded last year , its first loss since 
it was floated in 1997.
That deficit arose after the no-frills airline had to take a EUR222.5m write-off on the value of its stake in its smaller 
Irish rival, Aer Lingus, whose share price plunged after Ryanair made a failed take over bid for it.
Ryanair to pay dividend after record turnround
Mr O'Leary, who last December ended discussions for an order of 200 new Boeing aircraft, said on Tuesday that 
the airline expected to generate up to EUR1bn in surplus cash by the end of the 2013 financial year.
"We now propose to return EUR500m of this cash in a one-off dividend in October 2010 subject to shareholder 
approval at our September AGM," he said, adding another EUR500m could be paid either via share buy-backs or 
another one-off dividend by the end of the 2013 financial year.
Analysts were impressed by the latest results.
"This is a very robust set of numbers in an extremely difficult market," said Joe Gill of Bloxham stockbrokers in 
Dublin, who said the main reason behind the results was Ryanair's ability to "consistently keep their unit costs at 
industry lows".
"When things are good, you make a fortune doing that and when things are tough you stay profitable when others 
are losing money," he said.
"Ryanair has made a net after-tax profit of EUR320m in the same 12 months that Air France-KLM and British 
Airways have lost EUR2bn."
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
Mr O'Leary said the closure of European air space because of Icelandic volcanic ash caused the cancellation of 
9,400 Ryanair flights, and the loss of 1.5m passengers up to May 18.
"The full cost of these cancellations will not be known for some time and will depend on the [passenger 
compensation] claims we receive," he said. "We estimate the cumulative exceptional cost of these unnecessary 
cancellations is approximately EUR50m and we will continue to update shareholders quarterly on the likely final 
outcome."
Tuesday's results confirm Ryanair's strength as one of Europe's leading airlines.
The 67m passengers it carried during the 12 months to March dwarfs the 47m Easyjet passengers transported over 
the same period.
It is also more than double the 31.8m that British Airways carried, though many of BA's global routes are much 
longer and more lucrative than those of Ryanair, which remains very much a low-cost, short-haul European airline.
BA last month reported it had made a record annual pre-tax loss of £531m, more than the £401m it lost in the 
previous year. Easyjet made a pre-tax profit of EUR54.7m in 2009, though over the 12 months to September, when 
economic conditions were poorer.
Air France-KLM, Europe's second biggest airline by revenues after Lufthansa of Germany, suffered a EUR1.5bn net 
loss last year.
Lufthansa also made a net loss, though it was a much smaller EUR112m.

First the good news. Ryanair is giving something back. After 13 years as a public company, Europe's biggest low-
cost airline will pay investors a dividend. The one-off EUR0.34 payment per share comes as the airline tripled its 
annual profits to EUR305m, happily vacuuming up cash as the world around it fell apart. Indeed, industrial action at 
British Airways and ongoing economic uncertainty have only helped the airline's bottom line.
Now for the bad. Income from ancillary services, the life-blood of the airline, looks shaky. These sometimes sneaky 
extra charges for baggage and check-in service handed the airline EUR664m last year, more than twice its profit. 
But after five straight years of boosting the amount paid per passenger, this year it dropped to under EUR10 per 
person. At the same time, growth in passenger numbers declined for the fifth straight year.
Investors, then, may wonder whether the payment of a dividend is merely a sweetener as the company relinquishes 
its status as a growth stock and assumes some of the mantle of an income producing one. This seems unlikely for 
now. The trend away from business class travel for short-haul flights across Europe should be maintained by 
continued economic turbulence in the region. Furthermore, its new aircraft on order will allow it to carry 85m 
passengers within three years. This would give it a market share of about 15 per cent; still below the 18 per cent of 
the US market held by Southwest, whose business model inspired Ryanair.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, insists the dividend, along with plans for another EUR500m return to shareholders 
before 2013, is a one-off. But even though there is still room to grow, the continued trend of slower growth means 
that it is perhaps only a matter of time before the Scrooge-like airline becomes more generous with investors.

British Airways is losing money like it's going out of fashion. Hot on the heels of a £400m pre-tax loss in 2008, it 
dropped another half billion in the year to March. At least BA isn't alone: Air France-KLM lost EUR1.5bn during its 
"annus horribilis" last year. These are not just recessionary hits: the global airline industry was barely profitable 
even before the downturn and has failed consistently to generate a return on invested capital that covers the cost of 
capital.
BA's chief executive Willie Walsh, recognising this, has been trying to make permanent changes to the company's 
cost base. He has had some success, too, shedding almost 4,000 staff last year (a tenth of the global workforce) 
and arranging tie-ups with American Airlines and Iberia that could generate annual cost savings of about £400m a 
year.
Given that, will the improving global economy lift British Airways swiftly into the black? Probably not. The company's 
operating costs (excluding fuel) are still too high at almost 75 per cent of revenue; budget airlines Ryanair and 
Easyjet's costs are about 50 per cent. And while global passenger demand is improving more quickly than thought - 
up 10 per cent on last year in March - Europe is weaker than Asia and the US. BA expects its own revenue to rise 
just 6 per cent this year and hopes to break even at the pre-tax profit level.
Even that modest goal is hostage to fortune on several fronts. First, cabin crew strikes are set to return. A seven 
day walk-out in March cost BA about £40m; the next one will last twice as long. Then there is the changeable price 
of oil: last year's lower prices reduced BA's costs by more than all of Mr Walsh's cuts put together. Finally, Iceland's 
volcano might keep on rumbling for years. Just this week it disrupted hundreds of flights before a south-westerly 
breeze blew the ash away. Investors hoping for a clear picture of BA's future might as well throw straw in the wind.

European oil stocks led the gains on Europe's main indices on Monday after BP took action to stop the oil leak in 
the Mexican gulf, but worries about eurozone deficits continued to weigh on Greece.
Total in France rose 0.8 per cent to EUR38.73, Repsol in Spain added 1.2 per cent to EUR16.46 and Italy's Eni 
edged 1 per cent higher to EUR15.91.
The FTSE Eurofirst gained 0.8 per cent to 1,022.69.
The Athens General index weakened 2.1 per cent to 1,624.51 following remarks on Sunday by German chancellor 
Angela Merkel, who said that the EUR750bn European Union Greek bail-out had only bought the eurozone time, 
but the region's ongoing fiscal problems remained.
Greek banks fell, with the euro sliding to a four-year low as investors feared that planned austerity measures in the 
eurozone's periphery economies would hurt Europe's economic growth.
Piraeus Bank slid 2.9 per cent to EUR4.75, National Bank of Greece lost 2.3 per cent to EUR10.57, EFG Eurobank 
weakened 2.3 per cent to EUR4.68, while Alpha Bank declined 1.7 per cent to EUR4.73.
Airlines suffered as volcanic ash from Iceland caused widespread disruption at airports in northern Europe, delaying 
or grounding hundreds of flights.
Ryanair fell 3.9 per cent to EUR3.22, Air France-KLM dipped 0.5 per cent to EUR10.26, while Iberia lost 0.9 per 
cent to EUR2.25.
Oil groups lead Europe's benchmarks higher
Infineon, the German chipmaker, added 3.3 per cent to EUR5.21 on reports that the company was in negotiations 
with US peer, Intel, about the sale of its mobile phone chip business.
Hochtief, the German construction group, sank 4 per cent to EUR56.47, despite posting a first-quarter net profit of 
EUR33.1m, beating analysts' expectations, as well as confirming its full-year outlook.
The company has been under fire in recent days over rumours, denied by Hochtief, that there were problems with 
the quality of some supporting structures in the EUR500m  Elbphilharmonie project.
Gamesa, the Spanish wind-turbine maker, jumped 3.3 per cent to EUR8.23 after rival Suzlon Energy in India said 
there was great potential for wind power in the Middle East, especially the windiest countries Iran, Egypt, Morocco 
and Oman. Gamesa was also boosted by a broker upgrade.

European stocks closed lower on Monday in volatile trade with miners leading the fallers on the FTSE Eurofirst 300 
as copper prices plunged.
The index closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,013.06.
French mining group Eramet lost 1.3 per cent to EUR235.50 while Boliden in Sweden dipped 1.4 per cent to 
SKr91.45.
Oil stocks led gains in earlier trade after BP took action to stop the oil leak in the Mexican gulf. Total in France rose 
0.2 per cent to EUR38.51 and Repsol in Spain added 0.5 per cent to EUR16.36.
Worries about eurozone deficits continued to weigh on Greece. The Athens General index weakened 1.4 per cent 
to 1,634.61 following remarks on Sunday by German chancellor Angela Merkel, who said that the EUR750bn 
($927bn) European Union Greek bail-out had only bought the eurozone time, but the region's fiscal problems 
remained.
Greek banks fell, with the euro sliding to a four-year low as investors feared that planned austerity measures in the 
eurozone's periphery economies would hurt Europe's economic growth. National Bank of Greece fell 2.7 per cent to 
EUR10.53, Bank of Greece lost 2.3 per cent to EUR36.53 and EFG Eurobank held steady at EUR4.80. Analysts 
remained broadly negative on the country's banks even after the record bail-out.
Meanwhile, Italy's Banco Popolare surged as investors welcomed better-than-expected earnings. Credit Suisse 
said "the future looked brighter" for the stock and upgraded it from "underperform" to "outperform". The shares 
closed 6.9 per cent higher at EUR4.44 after they were suspended from trading following gains of nearly 10 per cent.
Miners lead declines amid volatile trade
Hochtief, the German construction group, sank 7.7 per cent to EUR54.33 after posting weaker first quarter new 
orders numbers in spite of its reporting a net profit of EUR33.1m, beating analysts' expectations.
The company has been under fire in recent days over rumours, denied by Hochtief, that there were problems with 
the quality of some supporting structures in a EUR500m project in Hamburg.
Airlines suffered as volcanic ash from Iceland caused widespread disruption at airports in northern Europe, 
grounding 1,000 flights.
Ryanair fell 3.5 per cent to EUR3.23, Air France-KLM lost 3.2 per cent to EUR9.98, while Iberia dipped 1.5 per cent 
to EUR2.23.
Infineon, the German chipmaker, added 0.9 per cent to EUR5.08 on reports that the company was in negotiations 
with US peer Intel about the sale of Infineon's mobile phone chip business.
The company pared gains on news that Europe's largest chipmaker alongside eight other memory chip makers 
including Samsung Electronics and Hynix Semiconductor would be expected to face European Union fines this 
week on charges of illegally fixing prices.
Finnish paper makers gained on the back of a weaker euro and a broker upgrade. UPM-Kymmene rose 2.9 per 
cent to EUR10.89 and Stora Enso gained 2.6 per cent to EUR6.04. Pulp prices are set to reach record highs in the 
next few weeks.
Gamesa, the Spanish wind-turbine maker, edged 0.1 per cent higher after rival Suzlon Energy in India said there 
was great potential for wind power in the Middle East, especially in the windiest countries of Iran, Egypt, Morocco 
and Oman. Gamesa was also boosted by a broker upgrade.
Pharmaceutical stocks were higher. Sanofi-Aventis in France added 0.4 per cent to EUR50.66 and Roche in 
Switzerland advanced 0.3 per cent to SFr163.90.

Cabin crew, take your seats and prepare never to take off. The suicidal streak of British Airways' flight attendants 
jeopardises the airline's survival. BA has cut capacity, but must still slash costs to offset lower passenger numbers 
and competition from no-frills carriers on short-haul routes. March's two waves of strikes and April's Icelandic ash 
were damaging enough; flight attendants now plan 20 days of walkouts. As before, BA will mitigate the fallout by 
(expensively) leasing aircraft and rebooking passengers on alternative flights. However, although BA shares have 
outperformed the FTSE All-Share index this year, Willie Walsh, the airline's pugnacious chief executive, should not 
count on investor support indefinitely.
March's seven days of walkouts, after all, are estimated to have cost up to £45m. UBS estimates the latest walkout 
will cost BA under £5m a day, putting the dispute's total cost at up to £145m, roughly equivalent to one-third of the 
full-year loss that BA is expected to announce on May 21. No-frills competitors EasyJet and Ryanair benefited from 
rebooked passengers and leasing out their aircraft in the first wave of strikes, and could do so again. Meanwhile, 
ash cloud disruption has cost BA an estimated £15-20m a day in lost revenue and additional costs. But ash-related 
costs might not affect its bottom line in the longer term as the European Commission is expected to provide 
assistance to airlines affected.
Industrial relations, however, are man-made. Investors might take BA's dispute costs on the chin if Mr Walsh 
achieves his targeted £50m of annual savings. They accept that BA needs to emerge from the downturn with a 
Ryanair-esque attitude to cost. But, for the maths to work, passengers need to have an incentive to choose BA too. 
Cabin crew and Mr Walsh appear to have overlooked that.

Britain: safe haven in the shadow of a debt mountain

So much for the markets' tyranny. Three trading days came and went after the polls closed and, while sterling was 
jumpy, wicked speculators did not annihilate the currency or plunder the gilts market just because Nick Clegg didn't 
plump for a partner straight away. On the contrary. There was greater demand for Tuesday's £2.25bn auction of 
2027 gilts - the first such sale of UK government bonds since the election - than last time, even as Conservatives 
and Liberal Democrats were still locked in talks. Could it be that political uncertainty is not as unsettling to investors, 
or the UK not as important to them, as the worriers thought?
The first explanation is only half-true. When the debt mountain is as high as that facing the new government, a 
couple of extra days at base camp don't make much difference. But longer-term failure to make credible plans to 
conquer the summit would be punished.
As for the second, it depends where you're sitting. A far larger crisis in the eurozone was only just averted at the 
weekend. If you're an investor who has just escaped the still-sizzling frying pan of Greek social unrest, the 
smouldering fire of UK economic uncertainty looks rather welcoming. That goes for inward investors, too. 
Continental European owners of British companies say sterling's position outside a crumbling single currency zone 
is still one of the UK's big attractions.
In other words, while it may seem strange to weary Westminster-centric observers, to many outside the country 
Britain looks, for now, like a haven.
Stelios spews fire
What is it with unpronounceable names, eruptions and airlines? Moments after unveiling a £50m-£75m hole in its 
bottom line courtesy of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland, EasyJet was dealt a blow by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. 
Britain: safe haven in the shadow of a debt mountain
Despite having more than a passing interest in the performance of the discount airline's shares, Sir Stelios decided 
to blast its performance under outgoing chief executive Andy Harrison.
Like the volcano, Sir Stelios's outbursts are unpredictable and the fallout indiscriminate. His long-running beef with 
Mr Harrison is over the latter's supposed pro-growth strategy - a strategy, however, that was anointed by the board 
and merely executed by its chief executive.
But does the embittered shareholder have a point? Sir Stelios is absolutely correct to say shares have gone 
sideways under Mr Harrison's stewardship. From the day he took up the reins in December 2005 to the 
announcement of his intention to quit four years later, the share price has barely budged (albeit that it hit some 
higher peaks in between, and slightly outpaced its peer, Ryanair). He did not quite double the size of the fleet, 
although with an extra 80 planes plying the skies you might be miffed that this year's profits before tax - assuming 
projections are met - will only reach roughly the level of 2006.
The absence of a dividend is galling, especially with £1.36bn of cash on the balance sheet. Sure, this is a cyclical 
industry that is prey to all the gods can throw at it, from pestilence to war. And true, given the travails of bigger 
brethren such as British Airways, EasyJet and Mr Harrison deserve kudos for delivering any profits at all. But as she 
prepares to slip into the captain's seat, Carolyn McCall, ex-chief executive of Guardian Media Group, should be 
under no illusions. Turbulence is the norm, especially when an irascible would-be co-pilot is on board.
Everything and nothing
It's hard to fathom why T-Mobile and Orange have named their mobile telephone joint venture Everything 
Everywhere . Harder still to work out why their owners, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, decided to attach a   
to it. The idea anyone would try to steal this name is as unlikely as the brand itself is absurd.
The venture's aim is to combine Orange and T-Mobile networks in the UK, to mutual benefit. On that basis, the 
brand passes muster as a slogan or mission statement. But other than on till receipts and customer contracts, it will 
be seen little in public. Mobile services will still be marketed as Orange or T-Mobile. Yet someone somewhere now 
has to present himself to clients as vice-president of marketing for Everything Everywhere .
The joint venture has spent relatively little on its new name, relative to more grandiose rebrandings. That's a mercy. 
It's also worth remembering we have learnt to live with, if not to love, names that were initially ridiculed. But for 
every Diageo, Accenture, or O2 (formerly mmO2), there is a Consignia (Royal Mail) or a Monday (PwC's consulting 
arm) that meant nothing and went nowhere.

European shares eased on Tuesday after stocks surged the day before following the EUR750bn European Union 
rescue plan to prevent the spread of Greece's debt crisis.
Investor attention turned to whether Greece would be able to smoothly cut its fiscal deficit, sending the FTSE 
Eurofirst 1.6 per cent lower to 1,021.94.
After Monday's sharp rally, the Athens General index lost 2.1 per cent to 1,742.49, Spain's Ibex 35 declined 3.8 per 
cent to 9,957.2 and Portugal's PSI 20 dipped 2.4 per cent to 7,157.13.
France's CAC 40 declined 2.1 per cent to 3,642.57 while Germany's Xetra Dax dipped 1 per cent to 5,951.94. 
SolarWorld, the German solar panel maker, fell to its lowest level since July 2005 after the company said first-
quarter earnings before interest and taxes fell to EUR24.8m from EUR37.8m.
Other alternative energy stocks were lower. Spain's Gamesa lost 2.5 per cent to EUR8.58 while Norway's 
Renewable Energy fell 2.6 per cent to NKr17.77.
Portugal Telecom jumped to the top of the FTSE Eurofirst after the telephone company rejected an offer from 
Spain's Telefónica for its 50 per cent stake in Brasilcel, the division that controls Brazilian wireless operator Vivo 
Participacoes. Portugal Telecom climbed 9.6 per cent to EUR7.80. Telefónica dropped 4.2 per cent to EUR15.85.
Carlsberg gained 2.9 per cent to DKr460.10 after the Nordic region's largest brewer reported better-than-expected 
earnings of DKr735m. Other European brewers were down. AB Inbev declined 1.5 per cent to EUR38.28 and 
Heineken dipped 0.1 per cent to EUR34.69.
Bourses ease back as relief rally peters out
Airlines were weaker as Europe's travel industry prepared for more stoppages this month after volcanic ash clouds 
forced thousands of flights to be cancelled last month.
Air France-KLM fell 2.5 per cent to EUR10.33, Iberia in Spain weakened 2.6 per cent to EUR2.21, Lufthansa lost 
2.2 per cent to EUR11.42 and Ryanair declined 3.3 per cent to EUR3.37 as carriers counted the mounting cost of 
air traffic disruption.

Temasek has no chip on its shoulder about resources

Who needs Chip Goodyear? Temasek, the Singapore state investment fund, last year hired the celebrated former 
head of Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton to be its next chief executive.
The prevailing theory was that Mr Goodyear would help the fund increase its focus on resources, a sector it had 
overlooked while gorging on financial stocks including Merrill Lynch and Barclays.
Mr Goodyear left by mutual agreement last year, before he formally took office, but that hasn't stopped Temasek 
fishing for energy-related deals.
Last November the fund, with little fanfare, invested C$310m ($305m) in debentures issued by Toronto-listed Niko 
Resources, to help bankroll a deal connected to Indonesian offshore energy projects.
Its latest deal involves spending at least $500m to acquire convertible preference stock in Chesapeake Energy, a 
US-listed leading producer of natural gas.
It will almost certainly acquire a slug of a second tranche of preference stock being issued by Chesapeake in the 
next 30 days.
Gas is trading at less than a third of the price of oil on an equivalent basis but Temasek and associated Asian 
investors are bullish for the commodity, citing the US push against using oil for new power plants and cars.
Asia's sovereign wealth funds are increasingly focused on the resources sector, not least in US-listed companies. 
Earlier this year, China Investment Corp disclosed its US investments: the lengthy list includes a holding in 
Chesapeake.
Temasek has no chip on its shoulder about resources
Turbulence as standard
What is it with unpronounceable names, eruptions and airlines? Just moments after unveiling a £50m-£75m ($75m-
$112m) hole in its bottom line courtesy of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland, EasyJet, the UK-based budget 
airline, was dealt a blow by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. In spite of having more than a passing interest in the 
performance of the discount airline's shares, Sir Stelios decided yesterday to blast its performance under Andy 
Harrison, the outgoing chief executive.
Like the Icelandic volcano, Sir Stelios's outbursts are unpredictable and the fallout somewhat indiscriminate. His 
long-running beef with Mr Harrison is over the latter's supposed pro-growth strategy - a strategy, however, that was 
anointed by the board and simply executed by its chief executive. Besides, growth is surely the whole point of 
newcomers; steadiness and dividends should be the preserve of the oldies.
But does the rancorous shareholder have a point? Sir Stelios is absolutely correct to say shares have gone 
sideways under Mr Harrison's stewardship. From the day he took up the reins in December 2005 to the 
announcement of his intention to quit four years later, the share price has barely budged (albeit hitting some heady 
heights in between times, and slightly outpacing its nearest peer, Ryanair).
He did not quite double the size of the aircraft fleet, although given there are now an extra 70 planes plying the 
skies one might be understandably miffed that this year's profits before tax - assuming projections are met - will 
also be running at roughly 2006 levels.
Sure, this is a cyclical industry that is prey to all the gods can throw at it, from pestilence to war.
It is also true that, given the travails of its bigger brethren such as British Airways, EasyJet and Mr Harrison deserve 
kudos for delivering any profits at all. But as she prepares to slip into the driving seat, Carolyn McCall, former chief 
executive of the Guardian Media Group, should be under no illusions. Turbulence is par for the course, especially 
with an irascible would-be co-pilot.
Superjumbo dig at BA
Air France is considering deploying next month one of its brand new Airbus A380 superjumbo airliners on its Paris-
London Heathrow shuttle service. The A380, seating as many as 800 passengers in some configurations, is 
designed to serve long-haul routes. But Air France, which already operates A380 services from Paris to New York 
and Johannesburg, is planning to fly the aircraft on the short cross-Channel route to speed up the training 
programme of crew members before it takes delivery of new A380s.
At least that is the official explanation. Yet one cannot help suspecting that the French carrier could also be 
mounting a cunning and well-timed marketing ploy by flying its superjumbos into BA's Heathrow backyard. After all, 
its British competitor is facing a potentially crippling 20-day strike by cabin crew from next week and has already

British Airways cabin crew have rejected the airline’s latest offer to resolve a long-running row over staffing levels, 
raising the prospect of a third strike at the lossmaking carrier this year.
Leaders of the Unite union representing the flight attendants will meet on Monday to decide what form of action to 
take after about 81 per cent of their 12,000 BA members voted against the offer in a ballot that closed at midnight 
on Thursday. There was a turnout of 71 per cent.
The margin of those in favour is almost the same as the 80 per cent of crew who voted for the last round of 
industrial action in March, when hundreds of flights were grounded after staff staged two walkouts over seven days, 
costing the airline an estimated £45m.
However the number of people voting has fallen from the 79 per cent turnout recorded in the ballot that led to the 
March stoppages.
Unite’s joint general secretaries, Derek Simpson and Tony Woodley, called on the airline to take notice of the result 
and immediately address outstanding concerns. 
“They should make no mistake that Unite is fully committed to supporting our members in furthering this dispute if 
no resolution is found,” they warned.
Cabin crew reject latest BA peace offer
The move comes a day after BA dismissed Duncan Holley, a flight attendant and union official who has worked at 
the airline for more than 30 years, in what he called a “ruthless” new approach by management to industrial 
relations.
Separately, BA reported one of the most serious falls in monthly passenger figures for a decade, after its fleet was 
grounded for almost a week in April by a  volcanic ash cloud. The number of passengers carried by the lossmaking 
airline fell to just more than 2m worldwide last month – a 24 per cent drop from the same month last year. 
Ryanair, which reports passenger bookings rather than actual numbers of people carried, said it had 6.2m bookings 
in April – a 17 per cent increase compared with the same month in 2009 – but added that 1.2m of those passengers 
had their flights cancelled after the volcanic eruption in Iceland. 
The sharp falls at BA come only weeks after the airline reported a 15 per cent monthly drop in passenger numbers 
in March, when thousands of its cabin crew staged two walkouts in the dispute over pay and staffing levels that has 
lasted for more than a year.
Unite leaders, representing BA cabin crew, have conceded that the company’s latest offer is an improvement on 
past ones but have urged their members to reject it because of what they say is BA’s “vindictive” treatment of 
employees supporting the strikes – some of whom have lost discounted travel benefits or face disciplinary charges. 
Several have been dismissed.
Union officials say they have a limited period in which to call the kind of prolonged strike action that some union 
officials would now like to see. That is because BA can legally take tougher action against striking workers, 
including dismissals, 12 weeks after the first round of stoppages, which began on March 20.
“I can’t for one minute see BA sacking people before that 12-week deadline has expired,” said Marc Meryon, a 
partner at the Bircham Dyson Bell law firm, who specialises in industrial law. To do so would be to invite claims for 
unfair dismissal.
Mr Meryon said sacking people after the deadline could still be complex and time-consuming and that the airline 
might want to consider other penalties.
He said the dismissal of Duncan Holley, branch secretary of the British Airways Stewards and Stewardesses 
Association, the Unite division that represents BA cabin crew, could inflame tensions in the dispute. “Sacking a 
union representative is about the worst thing that can happen,” he said.
Mr Holley said he was sacked after BA departed from previous practice and refused to allow him to go off normal 
work rosters to carry out union duties last December.
BA refused to comment on his specific case but said: “The company’s disciplinary process has been in place for 
many years and has been agreed with all of the airline’s recognised trade unions, including Unite.”

British Airways is facing the threat of more industrial action as the union representing cabin crew prepares to 
announce on Friday the results of a fresh ballot in the long-running dispute.

the airline for more than 30 years, in what he called a "ruthless" new approach by management to industrial

Bail-out fears hit shares in Portugal and Spain

European shares traded at nine-week lows on Wednesday, on concerns that the joint European Union and 
International Monetary Fund rescue package for Greece would not be the last eurozone bail-out, sending Spanish 
and Portuguese stocks lower for a second day.
Spain's Ibex 35 index slumped 1 per cent to 9,765.7, Portugal's PSI20 declined 0.9 per cent to 7,034.09 while the 
Athens General lost 0.3 per cent to 1,724.16.
Spanish banks remained under pressure. Banco Santander lost 1.9 per cent to EUR8.45, BBVA declined 2.3 per 
cent to EUR8.89 and Banco de Valencia fell 1.9 per cent to 3.93.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged 0.3 per cent higher to 1,033.53, however, on data showing a marked pick up in 
eurozone services activity in April.
"Improved incoming business is very good news given the important role of the sector in all countries' economies. It 
raises hopes that the eurozone's recovery is now becoming more broadly based and suggests that the upturn has 
gained further momentum at the start of the second quarter," said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight.
"Even so, economic conditions are still pretty challenging and renewed relapses in activity remain highly possible," 
he added.
Marine Harvest, the world's largest listed salmon farm, added 3.3 per cent to NKr5.58  after the company said it 
expected strong markets this year and next as demand stays healthy and supply of fish is limited due to lingering 
disease problems. The Norwegian company's shares have surged more than 430 per cent since January 2009.
Bail-out fears hit shares in Portugal and Spain
Meda, Sweden's largest healthcare company, sank to the bottom of the FTSE Eurofirst after it said first-quarter net 
income fell to SKr362m from SKR385m the year before. Its shares lost 9.6 per cent to SKr63.75.
ABInBev in Belgium climbed 3.2 per cent to EUR37.26 after the world's largest brewer reported an 11 per cent 
increase in first-quarter profit after a marketing campaign ahead of the football World Cup later this year.
Italy's Pirelli, Europe' s third-largest maker of tyres jumped 4.9 per cent to EUR0.44 after the company announced 
the separation of its real estate unit in order to focus on its tyre division.
European airlines were under pressure again as plumes of ash from a volcano in Iceland closed airports in 
Glasgow, Dublin and Belfast. Air France, Europe's biggest airline slid 2.6 per cent to EUR11.05, Iberia in Spain 
dipped 0.8 per cent to EUR2.36 while Ireland's Ryanair lost 1.5 per cent to EUR3.56 as investors feared a repeat of 
last month's prolonged closures.

Ash halts flights over northern UK and Ireland

A new ash cloud grounded flights for the second day in Ireland and the UK after European transport ministers on 
Tuesday expressed reservations about financial aid for airlines and airports stricken by  the Icelandic volcano 
eruption.
Airspace over Scotland and Northern Ireland and airports in the region will be closed again from early on 
Wednesday morning due to volcanic ash that has been drifting southwards from Iceland. Britain’s aviation authority 
said airports in north-west England and north Wales could also be affected.
Forecasts showed the concentration of ash in the atmosphere exceeded recommended safety levels, the Civil 
Aviation Authority said, while the Icelandic Meteorological Office confirmed an increase in activity from 
Eyjafjallajökull, the Iceland volcano. 
“The situation is very dynamic, so passengers expecting to travel from the impacted airports should contact their 
airlines to check whether their flight is operating,” the CAA said. 
The Irish Aviation Authority said it would impose a no-fly zone over Ireland between 7am and 1pm on Tuesday as a 
dense plume of ash drifted across the island. More than 440 flights will be affected by the closure, which will be 
reviewed this morning. Nats, the UK national air traffic controller, said it would not disrupt aircraft flying over Ireland 
from Britain or Europe, or southern British airports including Heathrow – Europe’s busiest air hub. “At this stage it 
will be business as usual at 7am tomorrow,” Nats said. 
Ash halts flights over northern UK and Ireland
The IAA said information from the Volcanic Ash Advice Centre suggested that the no-fly zone would affect Dublin, 
Shannon, Galway, Sligo, Ireland West, Donegal, Cork and Kerry.
“Ireland falls within the predicted area of ash concentrations that exceed acceptable engine manufacturer tolerance 
levels,” the IAA said in a statement. 
Irish airline Aer Lingus said it would cancel all scheduled services on its UK and European networks until 1pm. 
Ryanair and Easyjet said they expected some disruptions and cancellations.
The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority said airspace over the Outer Hebrides was closed from 6pm on Monday, with 
flights to and from the Western Isles also facing disruption. 
Airports in Northern Ireland said flights were expected to run as normal although some airlines suspended services. 
Iceland’s Meteorological Office said a change of wind direction over the past few days meant the ash cloud was 
blowing south and south-east towards Europe, rather than northward. But the ash cloud was much smaller than the 
one that paralysed airports last month.
In April, tens of thousands of Britons were stranded abroad and faced long delays when airspace was closed by the 
eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano. 
The cancellations cost the airline industry an estimated £1.1bn ($1.7), according to the European Union, which has 
proposed a series of measures to help the cash-strapped industry. 
European airlines have been demanding government assistance to cope with lost revenue and the cost of feeding 
and lodging stranded passengers. 
To bolster their case they have noted that flawed computer models used by member states were partly to blame for 
grounding aircraft even after it was safe to fly. The rules governing volcanic ash have since been revised, allowing 
flights to continue through areas of low density provided its concentration is not considered likely to pose any risk to 
aircraft and passengers.
EU transport ministers are due to meet this week to discuss awarding state aid to airlines, which were already 
suffering from the effect of the recession on the industry.

Air passengers are facing the threat of further disruption after the volcanic ash cloud that wreaked havoc last month

Ryanair in u-turn over ash compensation

Ryanair announced a u-turn on passenger reimbursement on Thursday, saying it would after all compensate ticket 
holders who had been stranded due to the volcanic ash disruptions of European airspace.
In a statement, the group said that while it disagreed with current European law on compensation for airline 
passengers, it would nevertheless meet the "reasonable receipted expenses" of Ryanair customers who had been 
stranded due to the airspace restrictions.
"The events of the last seven days, under which Europe's airlines were prevented from flying by the closure of 
European airspace, highlight how absurd and discriminatory the EU261 regulations are towards Europe's airlines," 
said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair.
"While competitor ferry, coach and train operators are obliged to reimburse passengers reasonable expenses, this 
reimbursement is limited to the ticket price paid to those operators. Yet the airlines are required by regulation to 
meet potentially unlimited expenses."
The climbdown on passenger compensation comes just one day after Mr O'Leary had said that Ryanair would only 
reimburse stranded passengers to the value of their tickets, but not food or accommodation expenses for several 
days as is required by European law, and said he looked forward to arguing this position in court.
Mr O'Leary said that Ryanair would continue to lobby for European regulations to be changed so that airlines would 
be placed under the same - less onerous - burdens of compensation that apply to ferry, train and coach operators.
Shares in Ryanair fell 1.1 per cent or 4.2 cents to EUR3.87 on Thursday.

Michael O'Leary's strategy at Ryanair is based on a brutal but usually sound assumption. There are plenty of 
cheapskates out there who will take the lowest air fare available, irrespective of the risk of delay or discomfort.
The Irishman's U-turn on his determination that Ryanair should not reimburse ash-stranded passengers beyond the 
value of their tickets is a rare acknowledgement that for a moment he misread the mood.
It was an odd error for him to make when other options were so clearly available. Airlines have proved time and 
again that the path of least resistance when facing financial pain is to wheel their begging trolley up the aisle to 
Brussels and claim state subsidies. Icelandic volcano risk was never anticipated when European Union legislation 
on compensation was drawn up. EU citizens are already up in arms. The case for airlines to get relief from some of 
the burden is strong.
But for Mr O'Leary to persist in saying that customers should bear most of the short-term cost of cancellation would 
have risked breaking the law and created a far more damaging impression: that Ryanair is an airline that will leave 
you in the lurch when natural disaster strikes. Just as this was the eruption that proved the rule that airlines should 
compensate passengers for excessive delays, so it provided the rare instance in which the O'Leary Theory doesn't 
apply. For once, the volcanically tempered Ryanair boss can only pay up and mutter "Eyjafjallajökull". Or words to 
that effect.

Ryanair  on Thursday made a U-turn on passenger reimbursement, saying it would compensate ticket holders who 
had been stranded owing to the volcanic ash disruptions.
The decision brought the low-cost airline into line with other European carriers that have mostly stated - albeit with 
varying degrees of enthusiasm - their intention to reimburse travellers.
Ryanair said it disagreed with European rules on compensation for airline passengers, but would meet the 
"reasonable receipted expenses" of customers stranded because of airspace restrictions.
"The events of the last seven days, under which Europe's airlines were prevented from flying by the closure of 
European airspace, highlight how absurd and discriminatory the EU261 regulations are towards Europe's airlines," 
said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair.
"While competitor ferry, coach and train operators are obliged to reimburse passengers reasonable expenses, this 
reimbursement is limited to the ticket price paid to those operators. Yet the airlines are required by regulation to 
meet potentially unlimited expenses."
Other airlines operating in Europe said they had adhered to the European regulations.
"We comply with the law," Easyjet said. "We have paid for 100,000 hotel nights already."
BMI said it would cover "reasonable expenses" for people stranded abroad, but declined to clarify what the criteria 
were, adding it had provided hotel accommodation to some stranded passengers for "medical purposes".

The group said that the European Union requirement to pay for accommodation and food was "down to 
interpretation".
Scandinavian carrier SAS said it would provide hotel accommodation and transfers to all customers stranded by the 
ash disruptions.

Arriva deal exposes flaws in patriotic defence

A foreign, state-owned company takes control of a British group with more than 23,000 UK employees at the heart 
of the nation's transport network. Surely, if ever Lord Mandelson wanted an excuse to show voters how a Labour 
government would apply a public interest test to prevent the UK's corporate jewels being carted out of the country, 
Deutsche Bahn's planned takeover of Arriva is the moment.
In fact, this deal - formally recommended by Arriva on Thursday - exposes the sterility of the "national interest" 
argument that some would like to see applied to British companies. But far from donning his Union Jack waistcoat 
and waving his Cadbury's law the campaigning Lord Mandelson hasn't even raised a well-groomed eyebrow.
Quite right, too. Of course, the Kraft-Cadbury and DB-Arriva cases are different. DB boss Rüdiger Grube's 
reassuring "Ich bin ein Sunderlander" pledge to keep the Arriva headquarters in north-east England was 
presumably partly made with the politicians in mind. But it was hardly necessary. Most of the 23,300 Arriva jobs 
around the country (many more than Cadbury sustains in its home market) can only exist in the UK: nobody can 
offshore the company's Hexham to Heddon-on-the-Wall bus service to Poland.
On several other counts, however, Arriva obviously lacks Cadbury's appeal to politicians and patriots. It was never 
run by Quakers. It has no brands that warm the hearts or line the stomachs of British customers. Even if, like some 
of its peers, Arriva had renamed its UK rail operations to evoke a golden age - York & North Midland Rail, perhaps - 
it's hard to incite nostalgia for a company that has run the CrossCountry franchise only since 2007 and is still 
occasionally confused with Aviva, Areva, Aveva or Aveda.
Even the preconception that Germans run railways better than Brits (misapplied in the case of Arriva, as it happens) 
dulls the jingoistic case for rejecting the offer, in the same way that the fear that Kraft would replace Dairy Milk with 
"American chocolate" inflamed it.
Arriva deal exposes flaws in patriotic defence
But the DB-Arriva deal exposes more than the fact that the flag-wavers' reasons for keeping Cadbury British were 
built mainly on cliché. A determined defender of British interests could still argue that the size and strategic 
importance of Arriva are such that politicians should rally to its defence.
But impeding a German bid for Arriva would ignore the fact that Deutsche Bahn already has a strong foothold in the 
UK, as owner of the Chiltern Railways franchise. It would also put a question mark over any attempt by other British 
transport groups to exploit deregulation and liberalisation of continental European markets, as Arriva has.
It would be hard enough for a former EU trade commissioner such as Lord Mandelson to argue against such deals. 
But any government should take this on board when next urged to red-flag foreign bidders. Arriva and Deutsche 
Bahn are examples of how the route to international markets runs in both directions - and a reminder why sensible 
politicians, in the UK and elsewhere, should stand aside.
Eruption proves the rule
Michael O'Leary's strategy at Ryanair is based on a brutal but usually sound assumption: there are plenty of 
cheapskates out there who will take the lowest air fare available, irrespective of the risk of delay or discomfort.
The Irishman's U-turn on Thursday on his earlier determination that Ryanair should not reimburse ash-stranded 
passengers beyond the value of their tickets is a rare acknowledgement that for a moment he misread the mood.
It was an odd error for him to make when other options were so clearly available. Airlines have proved time and 
again that the path of least resistance when facing financial pain is to wheel their begging trolley up the aisle to 
Brussels and claim state subsidies. Icelandic volcano risk was never anticipated when European Union legislation 
on compensation was drawn up. EU citizens are already up in arms. The case for airlines to get relief from some of 
the burden is strong.
But for Mr O'Leary to persist in saying that customers should bear most of the short-term cost of cancellation would 
have risked breaking the law and created a far more damaging impression: that Ryanair is an airline that will leave 
you in the lurch when natural disaster strikes.
Just as this was the eruption that proved the rule that airlines should compensate passengers for excessive delays, 
so it provided the rare instance in which the O'Leary Theory doesn't apply. For once, the volcanically tempered 
Ryanair boss can only pay up and mutter "Eyjafjallajökull". Or words to that effect.

Thousands of travellers stranded by the Icelandic ash cloud began flying home as London's Heathrow airport 
became the last one in the UK to open after the end of a six-day flight ban that is estimated to have cost airlines 
$1.7bn.
The end to the flight ban prompted claims that governments throughout Europe had overreacted to the ash cloud 
and should compensate the industry.
Willie Walsh, British Airways chief executive, said he did not believe the blanket ban imposed on UK airspace last 
Thursday had been necessary. "My personal belief is that we could have safely continued operating for a period of 
time."
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, the top long-haul airlines at Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, aim to operate 
all their inter-continental services on Thursday.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
But there will still be short-haul cancellations to and from London airports. With aircraft and crew scattered where 
they were grounded last Thursday, timetables will be ruined. Restrictions remain in Finland and parts of Scotland.
More than 100,000 flights have been cancelled since the eruption began, says Eurocontrol, which co-ordinates 
routes in the region.
Gordon Brown said on Thursday night flying rules might be relaxed to help get people home.
Accusations fly as airways reopen
"We were making contingency arrangements to get people though the Channel and to get people from Spain," he 
said. "But now it looks as if we can get lots of people back, and I think you will find that our airports are open longer 
to make that possible."
More than 100,000 British travellers remain stranded around the world and airlines warned it could take several 
days or even weeks before normal service resumes. "To get back to normal levels of operation from an industry 
point of view will take weeks," Mr Walsh told BBC television.
With aircraft having flown successful test flights for several days, recriminations have started about why 
governments took as long as they did to give the green light to the airline industry.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimates that airlines globally have lost $1.7bn (£1.1bn). BA has 
lost up to £20m daily, Tui (representing Thomson and First Choice) £6m, EasyJet £5m, Ryanair £5.2m, Air 
France/KLM £30.5m, Emirates £6.5m and Qantas £900,000.
"For an industry that lost $9.4bn last year and was forecast to lose a further $2.8bn in 2010, this crisis is 
devastating," Giovanni Bisignani, Iata director general and chief executive, said yesterday.
He urged governments to examine ways to compensate airlines, which he said would take three years to recover. 
"It is an extraordinary situation exaggerated with a poor decision-making process by national governments."
Despite their losses, airlines managed to save about $110m a day on costs such as fuel, Iata said.
In Britain, the Foreign Office advised travellers to contact their airlines to assess the quickest way home. EasyJet 
hoped to run 900 flights yesterday (86 per cent of its network), with 140,000 passengers, while Ryanair said there 
would be no flights until after 5am on Thursday.

Brussels to assess airline action on refunds

The European Commission warned on Wednesday that it would take into consideration how airlines treated their 
stranded passengers during the ash crisis when deciding whether they ­qualify for state aid.
State aid and passenger rights are separate issues. Nevertheless, officials said compensation behaviour and costs 
would inform their assessment of the impact, which in turn could influence any future state aid concessions for the 
industry, which has lost $1.7bn (EUR1.3bn, £1.1bn) during the past week's crisis, according to the Inter­national Air 
Transport Association.
The move comes as Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said he would wait for his day in court after the 
budget carrier warned customers it would not be held liable for their hotel and restaurant bills.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would reimburse travellers the original price of their air fare and no more.
"There's no legislation designed that says any airline getting a fare of EUR30 should be reimbursing passengers 
many thousands of euro for hotel accommodation. It's absurd,'' he said.
Ryanair carries on average 220,000 passengers on flights across Europe every day, but Mr O'Leary said he was 
not able to estimate how many of his customers had been left stranded.
It has cancelled all flights between Ireland and the UK until Friday to divert aircraft cover more in-demand airports 
across Europe.
In Brussels an official said Siim Kallas, the European transport commissioner, was "very clear that compensation 
and financial duties will be taken into account when we look at the impact of the crisis".
Brussels to assess airline action on refunds
Mr Kallas said he was "very, very concerned" by allegations that some airlines were refusing to pay for stranded 
passengers' hotels or demanding that rerouted travellers sign papers waiving their rights.
Against intense airline lobbying, the EU approved passenger rights legislation in 2004 to address over-bookings by 
carriers and other abuses that were causing frequent delays.
Passengers whose flights are cancelled or heavily delayed can choose to have a refund of their fare or be rerouted. 
If they take the latter option, their carrier has a duty of care towards them in the meantime, including the provision of 
food, overnight accommodation, and even telephone calls, as appropriate.
The law also calls for compensation for stranded passengers ranging from EUR250 ($335, £215) to EUR600 - 
although this has been waived in the current circumstance because the volcanic eruption was considered an 
unforeseen event.

European airports and airlines were scrambling to restore flights on Wednesday amid claims that governments 
overreacted to the ash cloud and should compensate the industry.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
About 75 per cent of flights in Europe were expected to take to the air - some 21,000 of the 28,000 flights normally 
scheduled each day, the European air traffic agency Eurocontrol said.
British Airways said it would operate all its long-haul flights departing from Heathrow and Gatwick airports after the 
UK reopened its airspace on Tuesday night, but there would be short-haul cancellations to and from London 
airports.
Flights began leaving Heathrow soon after 8am. But with aircraft and crew scattered where they were grounded last 
Thursday, it could be some time before schedules return to normal.
"To get back to normal levels of operation from an industry point of view will take weeks," Willie Walsh, chief 
executive of British Airways, told BBC television.
Officials at Heathrow are seeking permission to allow overnight take-offs and landings to clear the backlog.
More than 100,000 British travellers remain stranded around the world and airlines warned it could take several 
days or even weeks before normal service resumes.
Airlines resume flights amid compensation calls
With aircraft having flown successful test flights for several days, recriminations have started about why European 
governments took as long as they did to give the green light to the airline industry.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimated that airlines globally had lost $1.7bn (£1.1bn). BA has 
lost up to £20m daily, TUI (representing Thomson and First Choice) £6m, easyJet £5m, Ryanair £5.2m, Air 
France/KLM £30.5m, Emirates £6.5m and Qantas £900,000.
"For an industry that lost $9.4bn last year and was forecast to lose a further $2.8bn in 2010, this crisis is

He urged governments to examine ways to compensate airlines, which he said would take three years to recover. 
"It is an extraordinary situation, exaggerated with a poor decision-making process by national governments," he 
said.
Despite their losses, airlines did also save around $110m a day on costs such as fuel, Iata said.
In Britain, the Foreign Office advised travellers to contact their airlines to assess what the quickest way home would 
be. Consular officials in Spain organised for five coaches to carry about 250 Britons from Madrid to Calais but said it 
may now be quicker to wait for a flight. Plans for 150 coaches to head from Dover to Madrid this morning have been 
put on hold.
The economic impact of the cloud has already hit parts of the supply chain and could potentially dent the fragile 
recovery from the global recession.
PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated a week of disruption could destroy around 0.025-0.05 per cent of annual British 
GDP, and the same would probably be true of other European countries. But Germany said the impact on its 
economy would be limited.

European shares rebounded  on Tuesday from the previous day's losses, boosted by carmakers, banks and better-
than-expected German economic sentiment data.
Auto stocks rose after Daimler doubled its profit forecast for its Mercedes Benz unit. The German luxury carmaker's 
shares leapt 7.4 per cent to EUR39 after Daimler said that demand for Mercedes limousines was strong.
Other carmakers jumped on the positive sentiment. Fiat in Italy added 3.6 per cent to EUR9.88, Germany's BMW 
jumped 4 per cent to EUR36.71 and France's Peugeot rose 3.2 per cent to EUR22.46. Arndt Ellinghorst at Credit 
Suisse said that, although European first-quarter car sales were up 12 per cent he was convinced that the 
European mass market would be a problem later this year.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 added 1.4 per cent to 1,103.46.
Frankfurt's Xetra Dax jumped 1.7 per cent to 6264.23 after German investor confidence rose for the first time in 
seven months in April, according to the Mannheim-based ZEW economic think tank's monthly poll of economic 
sentiment.
Banks were higher after Goldman Sachs reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations. BNP Paribas rose 1 
per cent to EUR55.88 while Deutsche Bank added 2.2 per cent to EUR55.74.
Greek banking stocks rose after the country's finance minister said that the European Union was committed to 
covering Greece's short-term financing.
Daimler drives car rally in Europe
The comments came ahead of talks on Wednesdayday to discuss what fiscal measures the Greek government 
should take over the next two years. Piraeus Bank fell 2.7 per cent to EUR6.15 while Alpha Bank added 5.8 per 
cent to EUR6.60.
Although many flights remained cancelled European airports made tentative steps towards resuming air travel after 
the ash cloud from Iceland stopped traffic.
Air Berlin rose 2.2 per cent to EUR4.10, German peer Lufthansa added 1.8 per cent to EUR12.62 and Iberia in 
Spain rose 1.9 per cent to EUR2.54. Andrew Evans at Nomura said that the European airline sector had lost 7 per 
cent of its value since the closure of air space.
However "while the closure is unprecedented, we believe the current situation is not comparable with previous 
events such as 9/11 and Sars, and we believe there are selected buying opportunities as a result of the recent sell-
off," he added, recommending Ryanair. The Irish carrier's shares added 1.7 per cent to EUR3.83.
Raiffeisen International Bank rose 10.7 per cent to EUR39.80 after the Austrian lender announced that its minority 
shareholders would own up to 22 percent of the company after its merger with units of majority shareholder 
Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich.
Lanxess in Germany added 5.9 per cent to EUR34.92 after the speciality chemicals maker said it was expanding 
production capacity for high-technology plastics at its Wuxi site in China.
Safran rose 1.1 per cent to EUR19.10 after the French aerospace group's chief executive said it had made 
"significant progress" in talks to buy a unit of state chemicals company SNPE and expected to finalise a deal in the 
coming months.
Orion, the Finnish pharmaceutical company, added 3 per cent to EUR13.97 after it said phase three studies of its 
dexmedetomidine sedative drug had recorded positive results, meaning it could now apply for European marketing 
authorisation. Separately Novartis, which distributes Orion's Parkinson's drugs Stalevo and Comtan, said first-
quarter sales of the two drugs rose 9 per cent from a year ago to $141m. Novartis shares added 0.5 per cent to 
SFr56.70.

Unprecedented is a big word. But it may now be an appropriate word to describe the airline industry chaos resulting 
from the volcanic ash cloud over Europe. The disruption is worse than after 9/11. And it is affecting a business that 
is only marginally profitable in the best years; the airline industry, globally, is estimated to have made a net profit in 
only two of the years from 2001 to 2010. IATA, the airline body, was already forecasting a global industry loss of 
$2.8bn this year; it now estimates the recent airspace closures have cost airlines $200m a day.
European airlines hit hardest by the problems will face sizeable revenue losses from cancelled flights, though at 
least partially offset by fuel and other cost savings. Some remaining operating losses will be recouped once 
airspace reopens. But airlines will also face hefty costs for accommodating and rerouting many passengers. Even if 
not obliged to pay for hotels, they will do so in many cases to protect reputations for customer service.
The impact will be greatest for the European flag carriers, which are seeing the biggest chunks of their schedules 
cancelled, and carry the highest service cost burden. Low-cost carriers easyJet and Ryanair both have more routes, 
notably in southern Europe, that are as yet outside the airspace closure zone. And thanks to their no-frills ethos and 
lack of intercontinental connecting passengers, their hotel costs should be lower. Hence while estimated losses run 
into tens of millions of euros per day for British Airways, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, they are in the low single 
digits for the low-cost fliers.
Yet the greatest unknown is whether, given the Icelandic volcano is still erupting, disturbances could recur over a 
long period. If so, the impact on the airlines could be much more severe. It would become much more serious for 
the broader economy too.

Disruption from the Icelandic volcanic eruption continued to hit equity markets on Monday after the International Air 
Transport Association said that the economic impact of the ensuing travel chaos would be greater than the 
September 11 2001 attacks.
Airlines and travel companies led equity markets lower as investors feared the widespread flying restrictions across 
Europe could thwart the sector's fragile recovery.
Since the Icelandic volcano erupted on Wednesday, prompting the closure of much of the region's airspace, British 
Airways shares have lost 6.8 per cent. By mid-morning in London, they were down 3.6 per cent on the session at 
226½p and leading the declines on the benchmark FTSE 100 index.
Among budget airlines, Ryanair suffered the most. The shares were down 4.2 per cent in Ireland at EUR3.70 and 
have lost 9 per cent since the market's close on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Easyjet has lost 5.3 per cent and was 
down 3.9 per cent on Monday at 459.4p.
Across Europe, Lufthansa in Germany fell 5.7 per cent to EUR12.11, Air France-KLM lost 4.6 per cent to 
EUR11.87, Air Berlin dropped 3.7 per cent to EUR4.00 and Iberia shares in Spain were 4.6 per cent lower at 
EUR2.45.
The chaos across airports also hit holiday companies. Tui Travel, the biggest travel group in Europe, said 100,000 
of its customers had been stranded abroad as of Sunday. The shares fell 2.5 per cent to 284½p while rival Thomas 
Cook was down 3.4 per cent at 252.3p.
Iata warns on economic impact of volcanic ash
However, analysts said the sector was likely to bounce back as soon as the volcanic ash clears and restrictions are 
lifted.
Charlie Menegatos, senior trader at Accendo Markets, said: "The economic recovery has driven a recovery in the 
travel industry, and this has been clearly reflected in the rapidly improving Tui share price.
"Eagle-eyed traders should be ready for a very rapid turnaround and long trade opportunity when the crisis ends," 
he said.
Meanwhile, Groupe Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel Tunnel between the UK and France, jumped 2.5 per 
cent to EUR7.67 as travellers scrambled to find alternative means of travel home.

European shares fell on Monday as airlines and food producers came under pressure as plumes of volcanic ash 
from Iceland caused further flight cancellations.
Lufthansa lost 2.6 per cent to EUR12.40, Ryanair   declined 4.1 per cent to EUR3.73 and Air Berlin  weakened 5 
per cent to EUR4.01.  Aeroflot, Russia's largest airline, fell by the most in almost three months, losing 4.3 per cent 
to Rbs62.20.
Tim Ash, at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: "Media attention is increasingly turning to the economic costs, which 
surely will be substantial depending on how long this incident lasts.
"Talk of the need for government bail-outs for airlines will surely just add to concerns over the state of public 
finances in Europe."
Eurotunnel , the operator of the Channel tunnel, was one of the winners on the FTSE Eurofirst, up 3.5 per cent to 
EUR7.74, as travellers sought alternative means of travel. Pierre Flabbee, at Kepler Capital Markets, said 
Eurotunnel was also benefiting from the fallout after Easter weekend strikes at ferry operator SeaFrance.
Food producers dropped as the flight restrictions prevented their produce from being transported to their intended 
destinations.
Norway's Marine Harvest, the world's biggest salmon farmer, decided to reduce the amount of fish it harvests for 
the next few days. Its shares fell 2.9 per cent to NKr5.21.
Switzerland's Nestlé fell 3.4 per cent SFr51.25 and France's Danone weakened 0.7 per cent to EUR45.26.
Ash cloud's silver lining for Eurotunnel
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 0.7 per cent to 1,088.04. Germany's Xetra Dax dipped 0.3 per cent to 6,162.44 while 
France's CAC 40 fell 0.4 per cent to 3,970.47.
Banking stocks continued to fall after Friday's fraud charges against Goldman Sachs.
Deutsche Bank fell 2.6 per cent to EUR54.56, France's Société Générale lost 1.3 per cent to EUR44.70 while 
domestic peer Crédit Agricole weakened 1.3 per cent to EUR13.04.
Greek banks remained under pressure after officials said Athens was considering whether to activate the eurozone 
aid package underwriting its sovereign debt.
George Papandreou, prime minister, said on Saturday a decision on how to use the package would follow within 
weeks, leaving an element of uncertainty about Greek policy.
Piraeus Bank declined 3.2 per cent to EUR5.99, EFG Eurobank lost 4 per cent to EUR6.05, National Bank of 
Greece  fell 3.4 per cent to EUR12.85. while Alpha Bank stood 1.7 per cent lower at EUR6.24.
Analysts at Nomura downgraded Greek banking stocks on continued worries over liquidity and a deteriorating 
economic outlook. The broker said that investors were likely to continue differentiating between the eurozone 
periphery economies according to their risk profile.
"In this context we express a preference for Italy over Spain and Ireland over Greece by upgrading Bank of Ireland 
to 'buy' and downgrading Alpha Bank and Eurobank," said Jon Peace at Nomura.
Bank of Ireland shares increased by 2.5 per cent to EUR1.75.
Philips, the world's biggest lighting company, posted a first-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates, helped by job 
cuts and growing demand in emerging markets. Its shares added 3.3 per cent to EUR24.90
Shares in CSM rose 3.8 per cent to EUR24.82 after SNS upgraded the Dutch bakery products supplier from 
"accumulate" to "buy", saying that it was undervalued because its bioplastics unit Purac was getting regular 
contracts.

Greek banks remained under pressure on Monday after officials said Athens was considering whether to activate 
the eurozone aid package underwriting its sovereign debt.
George Papandreou, the nation's prime minister, said on Saturday a decision on how to use the package would 
follow within weeks, leaving an element of uncertainty about the next steps likely to be taken as Greece seeks to 
move away from the crisis.
Piraeus Bank declined 4.7 per cent to EUR5.90, EFG Eurobank lost 4.3 per cent to EUR6.03, National Bank of 
Greece fell 4 per cent to EUR12.77, while Alpha Bank stood 3.2 per cent lower at EUR6.15.
Meanwhile, analysts at Nomura downgraded Greek banking stocks on continued worries over liquidity and a

"In this context we express a preference for Italy over Spain and Ireland over Greece by upgrading Bank of Ireland 
to 'buy' and downgrading Alpha Bank and Eurobank," said Jon Peace at Nomura.
Nomura however upgraded the European banking sector to "bullish" from "neutral" on an improving economic and 
sector earnings outlook for 2010, low interest rates and inexpensive valuations.
Wider indices were hampered by  banks and airlines under lingering pressure after Goldman Sachs was charged 
for fraud and flying restrictions persisted.
Greek banks under further pressure
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 1.1 per cent to 1,082.84. Germany's Xetra Dax dipped 0.4 per cent to 6,157.63 while

Europe's air travel chaos extended into its fourth day on Sunday as a huge cloud of volcanic ash spread further 
across the continent, although test flights by Dutch and German crews, which returned without damage, suggested 
the situation may have eased.
The disruption, caused by an Icelandic volcano which was still erupting, has stranded thousands including German 
Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Barack Obama who both cancelled trips to Poland for the funeral on 
Sunday of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, killed in a plane crash in Russia a week ago.
Stranded in Rome, where civil aviation authorities said Italy's northern airports would remain closed until 8am on 
Monday, Mrs Merkel was forced to return overland to Germany.
KLM, part of Franco-Dutch Air France-KLM, said it flew at the regular altitude of 10km  and up to the 13km 
maximum. Germany's Lufthansa said it flew 10 planes to Frankfurt from Munich at altitudes of up to 8 km.
"We have found nothing unusual, neither during the flight, nor during the first inspection on the ground," KLM chief 
executive Peter Hartman, who took part in his airline's test, said in a statement.
"If the technical examination confirms this image, we are ready tomorrow to fly back our seven planes from 
Dusseldorf to Amsterdam. We then hope to get permission as soon as possible to partially restart our operations."
Ash cloud over Europe deepens travel chaos
Meanwhile, European aviation agency Eurocontrol said no landings or takeoffs were possible for civilian aircraft in 
most of northern and central Europe.
On Saturday, the agency expected just 6,000 flights in European airspace or 27.3 per cent of the normal level. On 
Friday there were 10,400 flights, 35.9 per cent of the usual number for that day.
"Forecasts suggest that the cloud of volcanic ash will persist and that the impact will continue for at least the next 
24 hours," the agency said in a statement.
In the UK, air traffic control company Nats said flight restrictions currently in place across UK controlled airspace 
would remain in place until at least 0600 on Sunday.
The plume that floated through the upper atmosphere, where it could wreak havoc on jet engines and airframes, 
was costing airlines hundreds of millions of dollars and has thrown travel plans into disarray around the world.
The volcanic eruption, while it appeared to be easing up on Saturday, could continue for days or even months to 
come, officials said.
Disruption spread to Asia, where dozens of Europe-bound flights were cancelled and hotels from Beijing to 
Singapore strained to accommodate thousands of stranded passengers.
On Friday, Ryanair, the budget airline said it was cancelling flights to more than 12 destinations in northern Europe 
until 1pm on Monday. As airports around the continent continued to shut, some analysts suggested the loss of 
airline revenues could reach as much as $1bn (EUR740m).
Across the continent, passengers scrambled to find alternative transport by bus, boat or the heavily booked 
Eurostar. One UK-based private jet broker claimed to have received an offer of £100,000 ($154,000, EUR114,000) 
for any aircraft that was willing to break the airspace ban to fly corporate lawyers from London to France for a 
business deal.
British Airways said all its flights to and from London airports were cancelled on Saturday and Sunday.
On Friday, shares in the region's largest carriers, including BA, Germany's Lufthansa and Air France-KLM fell more 
than 3 per cent.
As the disruption worsened, Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, the secretary-general of the Association of European Airlines, 
questioned the way the authorities were implementing flight restrictions. "We are concerned that different criteria 
may be applied by different authorities to determine if and when their airspace will be closed, and equally 
importantly, reopened for aircraft," he said.

Air safety authorities face mounting backlash

Air safety authorities are facing a mounting backlash as European airlines facing huge losses from volcanic ash 
flight bans start openly questioning the restrictions after successfully completing their own test flights.
Some carriers have warned European Commission officials in Brussels there could be airline bankruptcies as early 
as this week after four days of bans, which are due to continue on Monday.
The restrictions are a "scandal" said pilot and airline owner Niki Lauda, who flew in the cockpit of one of his FlyNiki 
jets on Sunday "to prove to passengers and the world that one can fly under these conditions".
"After consulting the manufacturer of our jet engines it's clear that the [volcanic ash] particles no longer pose a 
problem. In my opinion we could have been flying for a long time now," Mr Lauda said.
Hundreds of thousands of passengers have been left stranded around the world after much of Europe has been 
turned into a no-fly zone under restrictions the Emirates airline of Dubai revealed on Sunday were costing it $10m a 
day alone.
Several airlines met European Commission officials on Saturday to demand action, warning that some of their ranks 
could face bankruptcy as early as this week without assistance.
"There has been a huge lobby from the airlines - and a very effective one - saying that the situation is untenable," 
said one Commission official.
Air safety authorities face mounting backlash
Germany's Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline group, as well as Air Berlin and KLM in the Netherlands also safely 
flew more than a dozen aircraft over the weekend, mostly at low altitudes which do not require air traffic control 
approval but were cleared with authorities, according to one airline official.
The success of the flights prompted some airline officials to ask if authorities were relying too heavily on computer 
representations of the ash cloud that has been drifting over Europe, rather than flight tests measuring actual safety 
conditions.
"We need additional measures besides the computer animations, which means we need flight tests," said a 
Lufthansa spokesman told the FT.
Only 4,000 of the 24,000 flights that would normally operate on a Sunday across Europe took place on Sunday, 
said Eurocontrol, the air safety agency, which estimated that by Sunday night, more than 63,000 flights will have 
been cancelled since the bans started last Thursday.
The plume of volcanic ash that floated through the upper atmosphere, where it could wreak havoc on jet engines 
and airframes, was costing airlines hundreds of millions of dollars and has thrown travel plans into disarray around 
the world.The volcanic eruption could continue for days or even months to come, officials said.

Airline stocks tumbled on Friday as travel chaos caused by a huge cloud of volcanic ash from Iceland worsened in 
northern Europe and officials warned that the disruption could continue into next week.
Some 16,000 flights were affected. Only 12,000 of the region's normal 28,000 daily flights are expected to have 
taken place, said Eurocontrol, the air traffic agency.
Ryanair, the budget airline, decided to cancel all flights to and from more than a dozen countries across the 
continent until 1pm on Monday.
"This advice is based on the current stable weather trends, which continue to blow potentially dangerous volcanic 
ash across the British Isles, Scandinavia and the northern European coastline," the airline said.
The confusion led some analysts to suggest the loss of airline revenues could reach as much as $1bn, though 
others cautioned it was too early to give a definite estimate.
Shares in the region's largest carriers, including British Airways, Germany's Lufthansa and Air France-KLM fell 
more than 3 per cent. Ryanair shares also fell.
Airports in 13 countries, including the UK, France, Germany and Poland have now been affected after the 
authorities imposed no-fly zones because of the threat to aircraft posed by tiny particles of volcanic ash from this 
week's eruption.
Ash travel chaos hits airline shares
The industry group ACI Europe said these airports normally handled 2m passengers a day and represented just 
under half of European air traffic.
News agencies reported that the family of the late Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, said it wanted his funeral to 
proceed as planned, even though the disrupted air travel across Europe was keeping world leaders such as 
President Barack Obama away.
As the full impact of the disruption emerged, the secretary general of the Association of European Airlines, Ulrich 
Schulte-Strathaus, voiced concern about the consequences for airlines. "No one questions that volcanic ash poses 
a threat to safety. The air travel industry has well established procedures to deal with such extraordinary events 
knowing that no compromises can be made on safety," said Mr Schulte-Strathaus.
He added there was "concern" about how different countries were implementing the measures.

Airline stocks tumbled on Friday as travel chaos caused by a volcanic ash cloud from Iceland worsened in northern 
Europe and officials warned the disruption could continue into next week.
Some 16,000 flights were estimated to have been lost on Friday, the Eurocontrol air traffic agency said, or nearly 60 
per cent of the normal daily number, as a dozen countries restricted airspace in case tiny ash particles choked 
aircraft engines.
As the cloud drifted across the continent, some airports re-opened in Scotland and in Ireland, where the Ryanair 
budget airline said it was cancelling flights to more than 12 destinations in northern Europe until 1pm on Monday. 
But other airports gradually shut, spurring some analysts to suggest the loss of airline revenues could reach as 
much as $1bn (EUR740m).
Across the continent, passengers scrambled to find alternative transport by bus, boat or the heavily booked 
Eurostar. One UK-based private jet broker claimed to have received an offer of £100,000 ($154,000, EUR114,000) 
for any aircraft that was willing to break the airspace ban to fly corporate lawyers from London to France for a 
business deal.
In the UK, where restrictions remain in place until at least 7am on Saturday, a Met Office spokesman said that 
forecast winds over the next two days suggested a renewed risk of more ash drifting across the country if Iceland's 
Eyjafjallajökull volcano kept erupting.

Airline stocks tumbled on Friday prompting concern about the financial effects of the cloud of volcanic ash that has 
turned large parts of northern Europe into a no-fly zone.
Large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip as airport closures spread across the continent for 
a second day, affecting nearly 60 per cent of the region's 28,000 daily flights, according to the Eurocontrol air traffic 
agency in Brussels.
In the UK, where authorities were among the first to impose airspace bans, British Airways shares closed down 
more than 3 per cent, while in Ireland budget airline Ryanair was down 2.3 per cent.
Europe's largest airline by revenue, Lufthansa, closed down 4 per cent while Air France-KLM fell 3.4 per cent. In the 
US, the parents of American Airlines and United Airlines were also down in afternoon trading.
With weather forecasters predicting winds were likely to push the volcanic cloud further over Europe in coming 
days, some analysts began issuing more gloomy estimates about the cost of the disruption.
"The lost traffic revenue for airlines as a result of a complete shutdown in UK flights is likely in excess of £200m per 
day if all revenue was refundable," said Dr Ashley Steel, global chair for transport and infrastructure at KPMG.
However, many analysts cautioned it was too early to predict the eventual cost of the disruption, and pointed out 
that snowfalls that grounded airline fleets over winter did not end up costing carriers heavily.
"In January, snow caused multi-day groundings which ultimately had a minimum effect on airline profitability," said 
analyst Joe Gill of Bloxham stock brokers in Dublin.
Airline stocks lose altitude in ash trail
"Every day of zero flying takes on average about 0.25 per cent off an airline's annual sales although seasonality 
skews this considerably. This is happening at a time when fares are a touch weaker. If this was Easter week or the 
peak of July the problem would be much greater."
At least one aviation research group raised the question of whether European officials' reaction to the volcanic ash 
cloud was overly cautious.
"You have to defer to authorities," said David Bentley, European associate of the Sydney-based Centre for Asia 
Pacific Aviation, adding a "health and safety culture" might have prompted the dramatic response to the ash cloud.
Others disagreed. "I've just been talking to pilots who say the ash could be 5ft or 55,000ft up, you don't know," said 
aviation consultant John Strickland. "They said it might look like blue skies but the stuff is there and there's 
documented evidence of what it can do."
This was a reference to two incidents in the 1980s when British Airways and KLM jets suffered engine failure after 
flying through volcanic dust.

European shares held steady in early Friday trade with a stronger industrial sector offsetting losses from airlines 
after huge ash cloud from an Icelandic volcano caused  air travel chaos for a second day.
About 17,000 flights were expected to be cancelled on Friday due to the dangers posed by clouds of volcanic ash 
from Iceland, aviation officials said.
Carriers saw their shares fall as airports across Europe were to stay closed until at least Saturday.
Lufthansa in Germany fell 2 per cent to EUR13.01, Air France-KLM lost 1.8 per cent to EUR12.64, Iberia in Spain 
weakened 1.6 per cent to EUR2.62 and Irish Ryanair descended 1.7 per cent to EUR3.92.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was flat at 1,112.26.
Among industrials, Sweden's SKF, the world's biggest bearing maker, surged 8.1 per cent to SKr144.80 after the 
company followed Swedish truck maker Scania in making a better-than-forecast earnings announcement ahead of 
schedule.
Fredric Stahl at UBS said that "We think that SKF's and Scania's pre-releases have a positive read-through to the 
European industrials, in particular the earlier cycle mechanicals. We think that Sandvik and Atlas Copco in 
particular could react positively to SKF's pre-release."
Swedish engineering group Sandvik gained 7 per cent SKr103 while Atlas Copco advanced 3.5 per cent to SKr121.
Rival Trelleborg rallied 8 per cent to SKr54.25.
Ash cloud hangs over European air carriers
Elsewhere, Norway's Telenor added 3.6 per cent to NKr86.8 after the company said it was very close to securing a 
deal with Russia's Alfa Group to merge their Russian and Ukrainian mobile operators following a successful share 
exchange and the withdrawal of a law suit.
Germany's Continental climbed 2.7 per cent to EUR39.95 after UBS recommended Europe's second-largest car-
parts maker.
Bourbon, the French oil services group, lost 2 per cent to EUR32.40 after Axa Group's Matignon Developpement 
sold a stake in the French company.
Danish TrygVesta, the second-largest non-life insurer in the region, was given an "underweight" rating by Morgan 
Stanley sending its shares down 4.3 per cent to DKr362.
The delayed merger date for Austrian property development company Immofinanz and its emerging Europe unit 
Immoeast was approved by a Vienna court for April 29. Immofinanz shares rose 4.3 per cent to EUR3.16 while 
Immoeast shares added 4.4 per cent to EUR4.76.

Much of the UK and Europe will remain a no-fly zone on Friday after a vast cloud of volcanic ash from Iceland 
forced authorities to impose one of the most extensive bans on commercial flights since world war two.
About 17,000 flights were expected to be cancelled on Friday.
Britain's airspace will remain largely closed to all but emergency flights until 0700  on Saturday, aviation officials 
said.
A small number of services were being permitted as the ash cleared, mainly in and out of Northern Ireland, western 
Scotland and south-west England
Officials at Germany's Frankfurt airport, continental Europe's second busiest, said flights would be suspended from 
0600 GMT on Friday.
All airports in northern France, including Roissy-Charles de Gaulle outside Paris, which is the busiest airport in 
continental Europe by passenger numbers, will remain closed until 20.00 local time, the French civil aviation 
authority said on Friday.
"I would think Europe was probably experiencing its greatest disruption to air travel since 9/11,"  a spokesman for 
the Civil Aviation Authority, Britain's aviation regulator said.
Volcanic ash disrupts flights for second day
Vulcanologists say the ash could cause problems to air traffic for up to six months if the eruption continues, but 
even if it is short-lived the financial impact on airlines could be significant.
The fallout hit airlines' shares on Friday with Lufthansa, British Airways, Air Berlin, Air France-KLM, Iberia and 
Ryanair down between 0.8 and 2.2 percent.
The International Air Transport Association said only days ago that airlines were just coming out of recession.
Thousands of passengers were left stranded or diverted elsewhere as airlines struggled to cope with the unusual 
presence of a volcanic plume drifting across one of the world's busiest airways on Thursday.
"Dealing with crises is not unusual for airlines but it still amazes me what can come at you from out of the blue," 
said James Hogan, chief executive of Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways, who was in London on business.
Nats said it acted to prevent what it called "a significant safety threat to aircraft".
"This is unprecedented in living memory," said a Nats official. "I can't remember it happening before."
Around 2,000 people slept overnight at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, a spokeswoman said, adding they did not 
expect airspace in the Netherlands to reopen soon.
The disruption caused chaos throughout London as stranded travellers queued to rebook flights at Heathrow, one 
of the world's busiest airports, and tried to find hotel rooms or seats on the Eurostar train.
Many hotels struggled to cope with the sudden influx of travellers who had returned from the airport to stay another 
night.
"We had a lot of people check out and come back," said Mitchell Turner, guest relations manager at the 
Intercontinental Park Lane. "We've had to turn people away because we're full."
At Heathrow, there were scenes reminiscent of terminal five's troubled opening as frustrated passengers stood in 
long queues to try to rebook or get accommodation.
Mari Kristiansen, a 20-year-old student on her way home to Oslo after two months travelling in Australia, faced a 
three-hour queue for information. She said: "There's nobody here to give us any answers. People keep sending us 
to different places."
The European disruption followed the eruption on Wednesday of Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano, which hurled a 
plume of ash 6-11 kilometres (3.8-7 miles) into the atmosphere that spread south-east overnight.
Volcanic ash has caused a number of aviation emergencies. In 1982 a British Airways 747 descended several 
thousand feet after all four of its engines failed when it flew through a volcanic cloud from Indonesia. It eventually 
landed safely.
This year's activity marks only the fourth time that Eyjafjallajökull has erupted in the past 1,100 years. The previous 
occasion was between 1821 and 1823.
A smaller eruption that started on March 20 a few kilometres away from the glacier had subsided in recent days but 
experts had warned that a bigger eruption beneath the ice was possible.

European shares extended falls in afternoon trade on Friday as the US Securities and Exchange Commission 
charged Goldman Sachs with fraud, putting pressure on banking stocks.
By the close Deutsche Bank lost 7.3 per cent to EUR55.99, Crédit Agricole in France fell 3.5 per cent to EUR13.30 
and Banco Santander in Spain weakened 2.8 per cent to EUR10.49. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.5 per cent to 
1,095.30, down 0.6 per cent for the week.
A stronger industrial sector failed to offset losses from airlines after an ash cloud from a Icelandic volcano caused 
air travel chaos for a second day.
Around 17,000 flights were cancelled across Europe on Friday because of the dangers posed by the ash for 
aircraft. Carriers' shares fell as airports across Europe were expected to stay closed until at least Saturday.
Lufthansa in Germany fell 4.1 per cent to EUR12.74, Air France-KLM lost 3.4 per cent to EUR12.44, Air Berlin 
dipped 2.5 per cent to EUR4.22, Iberia in Spain weakened 3.4 per cent to EUR2.57 and Ireland's Ryanair declined 
2.5 per cent to EUR3.89.
Sweden's SKF, the world's biggest bearings maker, leapt 5.8 per cent to SKr141.60 on Friday after the company 
announced better-than-forecast earnings ahead of schedule.
Fredric Stahl at UBS said SKF's earnings forecasts would have a positive impact on European industrials. Swedish 
engineering group Sandvik gained4.7 per cent to SKr100.80 while Atlas Copco advanced 1.3 per cent to 
SKr118.40. Rival Trelleborg rallied 6.5 per cent to SKr53.50.
Banks join airlines in the gloom
Telenor, the Norwegian telecoms group, rose after it said it was very close to securing a deal with Russia's Alfa 
Group to merge their Russian and Ukrainian mobile operations. It added 3.2 per cent to NKr86.40, rising 5.1 per 
cent this week.
The delayed merger date for Austrian property development company Immofinanz and its emerging Europe unit 
Immoeast was approved by a Vienna court for April 29. Immofinanz shares rose 3.3 per cent to EUR3.13 while 
Immoeast  added 3.7 per cent to EUR4.73.
Online gambling groups Bwin in Switzerland and London-based PartyGaming were the subject of renewed 
speculation after rumours that they would complete a merger by this summer.
Bwin shares lost 1.4 per cent to SFr41.20, declining 7.2 per cent for the week.
Bourbon, the French oil services group, lost 2.9 per cent to EUR32.11 after Axa Group's Matignon Developpement 
sold a stake in the French company. Its shares fell 4.5 per cent over the week.
Germany's Continental climbed 2.7 per cent to EUR39.95 after UBS recommended Europe's second-largest car-

As Labour gears up for its most challenging election campaign for 13 years, activists describe a "Ryanair" feel to 
party headquarters in Victoria, with scores of advisers crammed into extra seats in the open-plan offices.
The usual layout has been rearranged to accommodate scores of volunteers and former special advisers no longer 
employed within Whitehall departments. Under the "brutal" schedule, work starts at dawn and many staff are still at 
their desks in the early hours.
"The lights are very dim, which is disorientating, I don't know if the idea is to make us work longer," says one person 
brought in to help with the campaign. "It feels not unlike a casino; but less fun."
Entering the first floor of the building through a lobby, there are two adjacent open-plan offices. Between them lies 
the "boardroom" used for top-level meetings such as Ed Miliband's final discussion on the completed manifesto on 
Sunday night.
Gordon Brown will spend most of the month on the road, drumming up support in constituencies. While in London 
he occupies his own office in a far corner, with another room next door for his key aides. Asked if it is true that Mr 
Brown sometimes works past 1am, one adviser says: "Sometimes it's much later. It's all about the Calvinist work 
ethic."
Of the two main offices, one is occupied by press officers, "new media" workers and analysts. The other includes 
event managers, fundraisers and regional Labour officials.
Labour officials complain about the insufferable heat. "You'd have thought that with our finances we could save a bit 
of money by turning the central heating down," says one.
'Not unlike a casino - but less fun'
At 7am the core Labour team gathers for its first meeting of the day at the central boardroom. Some are familiar 
faces from the seminal 1997 election. Lord Mandelson, sometimes seen sipping infusions of fruit tea; Lord Gould, 
formerly Tony Blair's pollster; and Alastair Campbell, former head of communications for the party. Mr Campbell is 
playing David Cameron in rehearsals for the leaders' television debates.
This has prompted wits to ascribe a Spinal Tap-type quality to the campaign, as the New Labour band reforms for 
potentially one last gig. "Everyone is mucking in," says one adviser, claiming Lord Mandelson made him a cup of 
tea on Sunday - in one of dozens of bright red New Labour mugs.
Other key figures include Douglas Alexander, international development secretary, who is the election co-ordinator, 
and business minister Pat McFadden, acting as his deputy. There are also two of Mr Brown's key political 
strategists from Number 10, David Muir and Justin Forsyth. While the manifesto was launched in a Birmingham 
hospital - breaching Cabinet Office advice - the focus will from today switch back to central London.
Each morning Labour will hold a press conference at 8am. Financial restraints mean croissants and coffee will be 
the order of the day - in contrast to the morning banquets on offer from the Tories. This will be chaired by Lord 
Mandelson, Labour's most assured communicator, whose capacity for withering put-downs will be tested over the 
next three weeks.
The business secretary is the chief election strategist, the central role taken by Mr Brown in the past three election 
campaigns. Only on a few occasions will he step aside for departmental heads such as Ed Balls or Andy Burnham 
to answer questions.
Lord Mandelson will also run Labour's "spin room" at Thursday's initial leaders' TV debate in Manchester. The prime 
minister himself is travelling Britain with his wife Sarah, longstanding "gatekeeper" Sue Nye and press adviser Iain 
Bundred. Ostensibly he will be meeting "real people" although last Tuesday some "well-wishers" who hailed Mr 
Brown at St Pancras station turned out to be Labour members.
Mr Brown will travel more by train and car than in previous campaigns, reflecting Labour's financial disadvantage 
and  a desire to contrast with Mr Cameron's "flashy" aircraft and helicopters.

EasyJet passenger numbers up 13.5%

EasyJet passenger numbers soared in March as the low-cost carrier benefited from extra European flights and the 
fallout from the British Airways strike.
The budget airline carried 3.96m passengers in March - 13.5 per cent more than the 3.49m it carried in the same 
month last year.
The increase follows a 12 per cent rise in February and a 10 per cent increase in January.
The improvement at Europe's second-largest no-frills airline is in line with that seen at its larger rival, Ryanair, which 
on Wednesday reported it carried 5.3m passengers in March, a rise of 13 per cent.
In contrast, BA on Wednesday reported some of its worst March passenger numbers in more than a decade after 
its cabin crew walked out for seven days.
The number of people that BA carried fell 15 per cent year-on-year to 2.2m, though cuts in the number of aircraft it 
flew during the winter also affected its figures.
EasyJet said that the BA strike had helped increase passenger numbers. "The strike was a contributing factor but 
most of the rise is due to our increased flights across Europe."
No-frills carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet have gained market share in the past year as recession-hit travellers 
have shunned established legacy carriers.
EasyJet passenger numbers up 13.5%
The trend is likely to continue this summer with both airlines intending to increase the number of seats available by 
about 10 per cent, even as flag carriers such as BA cut capacity. But while low-cost carriers have been steadily 
increasing their share of travellers on short-haul journeys, they have yet to crack the long-haul market.
The International Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group, reported last week that the global 
airline business was slowly improving  after suffering one of the worst aviation downturns in a generation during the 
global financial crisis.
But in spite of the buoyant passenger numbers on no-frills airlines, the Air Transport Users Council, the aviation 
watchdog, revealed in March that EasyJet and Ryanair had been the subject of the most complaints from British 
airline passengers last year.

While it is true that a majority of takeovers add no value for shareholders - at least those of the buyer - they have a 
saving grace. They add to the gaiety of nations.
Corporate life is conducted publicly in a suffocating atmosphere of politeness. Only in the heat of a bid can bosses 
let their hair down and fire off some childish insults.
As with other areas of human activity, cultural differences loom large. Take a recent riposte to a hostile, and 
rejected, bid by US miner Peabody for an Australian rival, Macarthur. In an almost lyrical passage, a rival suitor, 
Noble, likened the target's rejection to that of a "hungry hiker who stumbles upon a roadkill roo that had been in the 
sun too long, and not surprisingly [says] no thanks".
You rarely hear this sort of thing when foreigners come bidding in the UK. The best Cadbury's chairman, Roger 
Carr, could come up with during the recent bid from Kraft was that the bidder was a "low-growth conglomerate". 
Ooh - handbags at dawn!
The US and Ireland both have a fondness for Anglo-Saxon plain-speaking. When Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus in 
2008, its boss Michael O'Leary was likened to Osama bin Laden. In turn he compared the Irish carrier to Shamrock 
Rovers, a struggling football team. PeopleSoft boss Craig Conway likened Oracle's Larry Ellison to Genghis Khan 
when the US software giant made a bid. Not a good career move. Oracle won and Mr Conway was fired. Even in 
Europe, the gloves occasionally come off - if not always with happy results. In 2006, when Germany's MAN bid for 
Swedish truckmaker Scania, the latter's boss Leif Ostling compared himself to Winston Churchill defending Britain 
from the Nazis. He later apologised.
Sticks and stones
Globalisation opens the door to new variants of the bid insult. Perhaps in the future, a Chinese chief executive will 
refer to an antagonist as a "criminal of a 1,000 generations" or "tango dancer", insults once thrown at Hong Kong 
governor Chris Patten. Bring it on.

EasyJet's passenger numbers have jumped again for the month of March, rising 13.5 per cent compared with the 
same period last year to 3.9m people.
The increase follows a 12 per cent rise in February and a 10 per cent increase in January.
The improvement at Europe's second largest no-frills airline is in line with that seen at its larger rival, Ryanair, which 
on Wednesday reported it carried 5.3m passengers in March, a rise of 13 per cent.
Both carriers will have seen some benefits from the strike at British Airways, where cabin crew staged two walkouts 
last month for a total of seven days, but increased demand is seen as the larger factor.
As a result of the strikes, BA on Wednesday reported some of its worst March passenger numbers in more than a 
decade. The number of people it carried fell 15 per cent year-on-year to 2.2m, though winter capacity cuts also 
affected its figures.
Analysts said BA's underlying performance was still improving along with market conditions that have seen airlines 
around the world report better traffic results after suffering one of the worst aviation downturns in a generation 
during the global financial crisis.
The International Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group, reported last week that the global 
airline business was slowly climbing out of recession.

BA and Iberia on course for merger
BA and Iberia on course for merger

Body
The news that British Airways and Iberia have signed a definitive merger agreement resolves several issues around 
this latest attempt to create a fresh force in the global airline industry.
Most importantly, it means the deal is still on track. The two airlines first announced their tie-up plans in November, 
when they said they would sign a full merger agreement by March 30.
That date came and went last week without an announcement, raising some eyebrows. But the technical hitches 
behind the delay seem, for now, finally settled.
Second, there is now a name for the new holding company being set up for the merged body: International Airlines 
Group or, as it will inevitably become known, IAG.
Finally, it is now known that a number of authorities and regulators in the UK and Spain have signed off on the 
basic structure of IAG, which will be headquartered in London; registered in Madrid; listed in both cities; and run by 
BA's current chief, Willie Walsh, who will become its chief executive.
BA shareholders are to receive 55 per cent of the new company and Iberia shareholders 45 per cent, or 56 per cent 
to 44 per cent once the tie-up is finalised and cross-shareholdings are cancelled. BA and Iberia will still exist as 
brands and operating companies, with their own boards, chief executives and finance directors.
So if BA has not yet settled the fractious dispute with its cabin crew by the time this deal is due to be completed at 
the end of 2010, it will be Keith Williams, BA's current finance director and future chief executive, who will be sitting 
across the negotiating table with union leaders rather than Mr Walsh.
BA and Iberia on course for merger
Before he moves offices, however, Mr Williams is going to be busy tackling one of the largest potential stumbling 
blocks to this deal: BA's £3.7bn pension deficit.
Iberia has the right to walk away from the deal if it decides a deficit recovery plan - due to be approved by June 30 - 
is "materially detrimental" to the proposed merger.
BA has already come to an agreement with the unions over the deficit, with employees agreeing to contribute up to 
£37m more to the retirement scheme each year if they want to retain the current level of benefits. That arrangement 
now needs the green light from the pension fund's trustees and the UK Pensions Regulator before it goes to Iberia 
for approval.
Another, perhaps greater, uncertainty, is how much the deal will help both carriers' struggle to contain costs without 
triggering damaging strikes in the face of growing competition from no-frills airlines such as Ryanair, whose 66m 
passengers already outnumber the 58m BA and Iberia expect to carry each year if their tie-up succeeds.
BA is on course to announce its second consecutive full-year loss this year. Iberia suffered its first annual loss in 13 
years in 2009.
The dramatic downturn in the Spanish carrier's short-haul business has forced an overhaul of its domestic and 
European routes, which it plans to bundle into a separate structure with lower operating costs, in the process 
breaking with the heavily unionised permanent staff.
Iberia's pilots, cabin crew and ground staff are wary of such plans. However, they view the BA tie-up more 
favourably, seeing it as crucial to the airline's long-term survival.
A spokesperson for the Iberia chapter of the Spanish pilots union said on Thursday he believed the merger with BA 
could be positive for workers, but there was concern about whether it would result in large job losses in the airlines' 
marketing, sales and back office divisions.
The companies are targeting cost savings of EUR400m (£349m) per year by the fifth year after completion of the 
merger.
A quarter of that will come from IT and back office savings, but slightly more will come from savings on their 
combined fleet of aircraft. They are also hoping to make savings on maintenance and purchasing. The plans will 
cost EUR350m to implement. However, even if all the cost savings are achieved, there remains the larger question 
of whether this attempt to create Europe's third-biggest airline by revenue will succeed.
The most recent comparable precedent, the Air France-KLM tie-up, has not impressed some investors. That airline 
looks as if it will be the last of the major European carriers to return to profit after the aviation downturn. Its merger 
made it larger, as will BA and Iberia's. If they gain greater financial strength, that will be an achievement indeed.

A wave of consolidation swept across the airline sector on both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday as British Airways 
and Iberia reached agreement on their planned tie-up while US Airways resumed talks on a deal with United 
Airlines.
US airline shares jumped in reaction to United's approach to US Airways, which surprised investors after the two 
companies called off talks nearly two years ago. US Airways stock rose 13 per cent at one point while United's 
parent was up 9 per cent.
The response to the more advanced BA-Iberia deal was less dramatic, having been factored in after the two 
carriers announced a memorandum of understanding on the merger last November.
Their formal agreement on Thursday is confirmation that regulators have approved the structure of the deal, which 
would create the fourth largest airline group by revenues and the third largest in Europe.
It would have a fleet of 408 aircraft fleet and carry more than 58m passengers a year.
The push for consolidation among older flag carriers has intensified amid the aviation downturn triggered by the 
financial crisis and competition from no-frills rivals such as Ireland's Ryanair and Southwest Airlines of the US.
While BA and Iberia will retain their brands and be run as separate operating companies, the two revealed a new 
holding company for the merged group, which will have Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, at the helm and will be 
called International Airlines Group.
Antonio Vázquez, Iberia's chairman, will take up the chairmanship of IAG.
Airlines swept up in merger moves
BA shareholders will initially hold 55 per cent of the new company, leaving Iberia's investors with 45 per cent, but 
each airline would have its own chief executive and operating company in London and Madrid to preserve both 
brands and existing flying rights.
BA shareholders will receive one share in the new company for every one held in the UK airline, while Iberia's 
shareholders will get 1.0205.
The carriers said the deal, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year, would generate synergies of 
about EUR400m ($534m) by the fifth year. It requires regulatory clearance from Brussels and needs approval of 
both sets of shareholders.

Airline consolidation took centre stage on both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday as British Airways and Iberia 
reached agreement on their planned tie-up while US Airways resumed talks on a deal with United Airlines.
US airline shares jumped in reaction to United's discussions with US Airways, which surprised investors after the 
companies called off talks nearly two years ago.
US Airways closed up 10.7 per cent at $7.55 while United's parent rose nearly 7 per cent to $20.23.
The response to the more advanced BA-Iberia deal was less dramatic, having been factored in after the carriers 
announced a memorandum of understanding on the merger last November.
BA closed up 3 per cent at 245p and Iberia ended the day up 2 per cent at EUR2.68.
Their formal agreement on Thursday is confirmation that regulators in London and Madrid have approved the 
structure of the deal, which would create the fourth largest airline group by revenues and the third largest in Europe 
after Lufthansa of Germany and Air France-KLM.
The carriers claim that the deal, expected to be completed by the end of this year, would generate savings of about 
EUR400m (£350m) by the fifth year.
But in a sign of possible difficulties, leaders of the Unite union that represents more than 30,000 BA workers warned 
that while they accepted the logic of the merger, workers needed guarantees of job security.
"We support this move, but not at any cost," Steve Turner, Unite national officer for civil aviation, said.
Airlines swept up in merger moves
The consolidation push among older flag carriers has intensified amid the aviation downturn triggered by the 
financial crisis, and competition from no-frills rivals such as Ireland's Ryanair , which has twice as many passengers 
as BA, and Southwest Airlines of the US.
While BA and Iberia will retain their brands and be run as separate operating companies under the proposed 
merger, a holding company will be created to sit above them, called International Airlines Group.
One of the deal's potential stumbling blocks is BA's £3.7bn pension scheme deficit.
The airline is working on a recovery plan, due to be approved by the UK pensions regulator by June 30.
But Iberia can pull out of the deal if it decides that the plan would be "materially detrimental to the economic 
premises of the proposed merger".
The deal needs regulatory clearance from Brussels and the approval of both sets of shareholders.

Talks resume as BA reveals effect of walkouts

The damage inflicted on British Airways from cabin-crew walkouts was revealed when the airline disclosed a 
decline in passenger numbers in March equivalent to the fall it suffered in the month after the September 11 
terrorist attacks.
The 15 per cent drop in passenger numbers in March came amid seven days of strikes by cabin crew that BA said 
could cost it up to £45m. While the airline blamed winter cuts for some of the reduction in its operational capacity, it 
was was the worst March in more than a decade for passenger numbers.
Wednesday's figures came as the Unite union representing most of BA's 13,400 flight attendants revealed talks to 
avert further industrial action had resumed over the Easter weekend and "some serious progress" had been made.
Tony Woodley, Unite's joint general secretary, said negotiations would keep going over the next few days and no 
further strike dates would be set while productive talks continued.
The fresh discussions in the long-running dispute over cabin crew pay and staffing levels will be encouraging for 
those concerned about further industrial action at BA, which saw its shares slide 2 per cent on Wednesday.
Throughout the disruption, BA fought a sharp verbal war with Unite over the real effect of the two walk-outs staged 
for three days after March 20 and four days after March 27, insisting its use of hired aircraft and flight crew had 
helped keep a substantial proportion of its passengers flying.
But its monthly traffic figures published  revealed it carried just 2.2m passengers worldwide in March, 14.6 per cent 
fewer than in the same month last year, and well below the numbers normally seen for the relatively quiet month.
Talks resume as BA reveals effect of walkouts
While monthly passenger data gives some indication of an airline's performance, analysts are far more interested in 
so-called yields, or average fares. BA generally releases these data quarterly.
The fall in BA's passenger numbers in March was equal to the decline it suffered in October 2001, when the 
September 11 terrorist attacks prompted one of the global airline industry's worst downturns.
In contrast, Ryanair reported that its passenger numbers had jumped by 13 per cent in March to 5.3m, a figure that 
the no-frills airline said was probably helped in "small part" by the BA strike.
However, analysts were encouraged by the fact that BA's figures were above expectations on some fronts, 
especially lucrative first and business class passenger traffic, which fell by 7.2 per cent in March, compared with a 
12.2 per cent fall in economy traffic.
Neil Glynn, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said: "They were ahead of my own expectations and the underlying 
environment, which is the most important part of this, continues to improve".
BA confirmed that the total cost of the March strike action could be between £40m and £45m, with half of the 
capacity reduction due to strikes and half by planned winter capacity cuts.
BA shares fell 2 per cent to 238.20p.

Ryanair to raise checked baggage charge

Ryanair is increasing its checked luggage fees from £15 to £20 for the busiest summer months of July and August, 
in a move analysts estimated could raise up to £20m ($30m).
The Dublin-based airline said it was bringing in the increase, which affects all bookings made after midnight on 
Wednesday, because it was "determined to incentivise passengers to travel light this summer".
The new fees mean people taking a return flight with Europe's biggest no-frills airline will pay £40, or EUR40, in July 
and August, or £20 for each leg of the journey.
EasyJet, Ryanair's main rival, charges £18 for a checked bag weighing up to 20kg on a return flight.
Neither airline charges for carry-on luggage, which each encourages to help speed up airport turnrounds, reduce 
handling costs and boost fuel efficiency.
The new charge at Ryanair, a leader in the trend for airlines to raise extra money by charging for services such as 
on-board food and luggage, could generate substantial revenues, analysts said.
"Assuming about 23m passengers travel during the July-September quarter and 30 per cent of passengers check in 
bags, then revenue of EUR23m (£20.2m) will be generated from this price change," said Joe Gill, of Bloxham 
stockbrokers in Dublin.
"That equates to about 7 per cent of net profits produced in the year to March 2010."
Ryanair to raise checked baggage charge
However, Mr Gill said it was not clear that the extra money would fall to the bottom line at Ryanair, which last week 
announced it was raising its profit after tax guidance for the year to March 31 from EUR275m to at least EUR310m 
because of stronger than expected bookings and higher average fares during late February and March.
"First, Ryanair can recycle part of the bag revenue into more competitive fares.
"Second, the penetration rate among passengers could fall in response to the price change," Mr Gill said.

European shares hit a fresh 18-month high, boosted by energy stocks and chipmakers.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 advanced 0.4 per cent to 1,098.66: its highest level since September 2008.
Lundin Petroleum jumped as much as 11 per cent after the Swedish oil company said it had completed the spin-off 
of its UK business into EnQuest as it concentrates on drilling off the coast of Norway and at other sites. Its shares 
pared their gains by midday, up 9.1 per cent to SKr52.30.
Meanwhile, in early trade , Total in France rose 1.9 per cent to EUR44.49, Spain's Repsol added 0.5 per cent to 
EUR18.09 and Statoil in Norway climbed 3.4 per cent to NKr142.30 as US oil futures closed on Monday at more 
than $86 a barrel, their highest in 18 months.
France's Lafarge, the world's biggest cement producer, added 3 per cent to EUR54.60 following the Sawiris family's 
purchase of 6m options in the company. If exercised, the options would lead to an increase of 2.1 per cent from the 
current Sawiris holding of 13.9 per cent in Lafarge.
Ryanair gained after the Irish airline raised its 2010 full year guidance, from a net profit of EUR275m to not less 
than EUR310m, following stronger passenger bookings than expected in the run-up to the Easter holidays.
Neil Glynn, analyst at Credit Suisse, said: "We expect sentiment towards the stock to continue to improve in the 
lead-up to June." Its shares added 0.7 per cent to EUR4.
Germany's Infineon, Europe's second-biggest chipmaker, climbed 2.4 per cent to EUR5.23 after Citigroup raised 
the company's price target.
Energy companies help Europe to fresh high
Chipmakers were driven higher after Apple said it had sold more than 300,000 of the iPad tablet on the first day of 
their debut weekend in a sign of renewed positive sentiment in a sector that was badly hit in the economic 
downturn. Aixtron in Germany added 2.7 per cent to EUR28.41, and Logitech, the Swiss computer peripherals 
maker, jumped 3.7 per cent to SFr18.09.
Eramet rose 5.8 per cent to 282.75, extending the 4.9 per cent increase on April 1 after the French nickel producer 
was raised to "neutral" from "underperform" at Exane BNP Paribas.
Carbone Lorraine rose 1.6 percent to EUR27.90 after the world's second-biggest maker of industrial fuses said it 
would buy 85 per cent of French high-tech ceramics company Boostec from EADS, the European aerospace and 
defence conglomerate. EADS shares held steady at EUR15.24.

Public speaking can broaden your horizons. I recently accepted an invitation to speak on the credit crunch at a 
dinner in Ireland. I had not been to the Republic of Ireland since a freezing weekend in November 2008 when I went 
stalking in County Galway. I woke at 3am drenched in perspiration and resolved to go straight to the doctor on my 
return and get some HRT. Then I realised that I had left the electric blanket on.
On that occasion, I flew from Luton to Galway; this time from Heathrow to Dublin. What a difference 18 months 
makes. Ireland has not had a good recession. Just to make the point, the lunchtime Aer Lingus flight my hosts had 
booked for me included no lunch. You could buy some very average sandwiches from a trolley after consulting a 
laminated menu. If I had wanted to order average sandwiches from a laminated menu, I would have travelled on a 
budget airline! I'd deliberately avoided EasyJet or Ryanair in case I was charged for the privilege of breathing. But I 
still ended up reading a laminated menu.
The story didn't get much better once we touched down. My hosts had arranged for a taxi driver to meet me at the 
information desk in the arrivals hall. I waited. And waited. Then I called and got the number of the taxi company, 
which led me finally to the number of the driver. After some challenging communication (received pronunciation 
English meets vernacular Irish) I established that he was in the vicinity, but was not planning to park and come to 
meet me since that would cost money. Didn't I know there was a recession on? I was directed to go upstairs and 
meet him outside Door 2 of the departure hall.
Next time any of you are in Dublin airport, have a look at the doors in the departure hall. They are numbered only 
on the outside. By the time I found the taxi driver and made it into Dublin, I was fainting with hunger. I ventured out 
of the hotel and found a branch of Tesco, where I bought some lunch and stocked up on supplies for the flight home 
the next day. I was even starting to regret telling my hosts that I would prefer to speak during dessert. (I usually do 
this to avoid eating yet more unnecessary food. To paraphrase Bette Midler, my view on dessert is that I can either 
It's tough to navigate through a recession without dessert
eat it or rub it on my thighs, because that is where it is ultimately going.) But I need not have worried. There was no 
dessert! My hosts explained that having dessert might have seemed like unnecessary largesse. There was, after 
all, a recession on.
Back in the UK, I decided not to charge for my next dinner speaking engagement so that my hosts might be able to 
afford dessert. When I got there, they asked me if I would like a present in lieu of a fee. What a nice idea, I said, 
thinking a case of wine (or possibly some dessert) might arrive at the office.
The next day, the organiser's office phoned Observant Olivia. My host, it was explained, was very grateful for my 
speech and wanted to buy me something. Not a case of wine, but something I really wanted but couldn't justify 
buying for myself - an aviation GPS. OO thanked them kindly but explained that, just as I aspire to eliminate 
laminated menus from my travel experiences, I also aspire to a Garmin 486, which might look like unnecessary 
largesse. There is, after all, a recession on.
Amazingly enough, a Garmin 486 duly arrived at our office. This produced whoops of joy rarely observed in a 48-
year-old mother-of-three. I spent Mother's Day prevailing on the goodwill of my children to get it set up, loaded up 
with the right software and pressed into action. (For those of you reading this outside the UK, I fly planes, but am 
not a time traveller. Our Mother's Day is in March.) Thanks to the speech I gave, there will be no more laminated 
menus for me, and much broader horizons. Next time I visit Ireland, I am going to fly myself.

Russian stocks reached their highest level since before the Lehman collapse as the price of crude oil reached an 18 
month peak on Thursday.
The country's equities are fast approaching the level they reached  before it fought a five-day war with Georgia in 
August 2008 .
In a shorter European trading week before the Easter holidays, Russia's dollar-denominated RTS Index added 5.8 
per cent over the week to 1,607.95. It has risen more than 220 per cent since its trough in January 2009.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 added 1.3 per cent to 1,094.05 by Thursday. The CAC 40 in France gained 1.4 per cent to 
4,034.23 while the Xetra DAX rose 1.9 per cent to 6,235.56.
Revisions to data showed that manufacturing activity in the eurozone grew at its fastest pace in over three years 
last month.
Richemont, the world's largest jewellery maker, rose after agreeing to buy the 67 per cent it does not already own in 
Net-a-Porter, the UK-based online fashion retailer. Investors were relieved after weeks of speculation, sending 
Richemont's shares 1.2 per cent higher over the week to SFr41.60. They have now risen nearly 15 per cent since 
the start of March.
Shares in Finnish drug maker Orionsank after US regulators said that the company's drug for Parkinson's Disease, 
which it is developing with Switzerland's Novartis, may be linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer.

Russian shares hit pre- Lehman peak on oil rally
Dublin-based Ryanair  jumped to its highest in more than two years after Europe's biggest low-cost airline 
announced better-than-expected annual profit numbers. Its shares jumped 8 per cent to EUR3.97 on Thursday.
Metso  in Finland rebounded from three days of losses after the world's biggest maker of rock crushers agreed to 
sell its Flexowell conveyor belt unit to Germany's ContiTech Transportband-systeme. Metso's shares rose 5.2 
percent to EUR25.16 on Thursday.

speculation that such a strategic alliance would be forged.
The conflicting comments sent shares in all three companies lower over the week. MAN's shares fell 1.7 per cent to 
EUR62.35, Volkswagen lost 1.4 per cent to EUR71.60 while Scania weakened 1.7 per cent to SKr 114.90

European equities posted their fourth consecutive quarterly gains, even as shares fell in afternoon trading on 
Wednesday. The losses came after Moody's downgraded five Greek banks and worse-than-expected US jobs data.
Greek banking stocks fell after Moody's said they were under pressure from the country's fiscal challenges. National 
Bank of Greece fell 2.6 per cent to EUR14.90, EFG Euro­bank lost 2.9 per cent to EUR6.80 and Alpha Bank slid 1.3 
per cent to EUR7.01.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.1 per cent to 1,075.01 but had its biggest monthly gain since July 2009, rising 6.7 per 
cent.
France's CAC 40 and Germany's Xetra Dax have also seen quarter-on-quarter gains since March 2009.
Bank of Ireland shares soared 24.1 per cent to EUR1.60 after it said it could raise privately about half the EUR2.7bn 
($3.7bn) it needs to meet capital requirements.
It said it was in talks with investment banks to fill the gap left by property loan sales to the National Asset 
Management Agency, Ireland's "bad bank". Raul Sinha at Nomura said BoI was better positioned to deal with the 
new requirements than its rival, Allied Irish Banks.
BoI is required to raise 1.7 times its market capitalisation by the end of 2010 while AIB must raise EUR7.4bn of 
equity, or 5.3 times.
Moody's adds to pressure on Greek banks
"This is likely to lead to further downside for the shares in our view, with AIB likely to end up with a majority 
government holding even after disposal of its UK, US and Polish assets," Mr Sinha said. AIB fell 3.2 per cent to 
EUR1.21.
The preferred shares of Fresenius dipped 0.1 per cent to EUR55.90 after the parent company of the world's biggest 
provider of kidney dialysis proposed to convert all its preferred stock into ordinary shares and to change its legal 
status.
Analysts said the move aimed to improve the positioning of Fresenius on the Xetra DAX and increase its flexibility 
to finance further growth if required. Fresenius' ordinary shares gained 6.7 per cent to EUR55.11.
Airlines were in focus after British Airways failed to sign a merger agreement with Spain's Iberia on Wednesday for 
"technical reasons". Iberia said the deal to create the world's third-largest airline would be settled within days. Iberia 
shares fell 1.7 per cent to EUR2.59.
Finnair said the first signs of passenger traffic picking up in Europe and Asia were starting to show. Shares in the 
Finnish national carrier climbed 5.8 per cent to EUR4.35.
Dublin-based carrier Ryanair, Europe's largest discount airline, said it had sued the French government for about 
EUR110m for providing "unlawful state aid" to Air France-KLM in the form of reductions in airport charges on 
domestic routes. Ryanair added 0.5 per cent to EUR3.69 while Air France-KLM fell 0.2 per cent to EUR11.63.
Renewable Energy, one of the world's biggest makers of solar energy equipment, rose after the Norwegian 
company said prices of the wafers used to make solar panels had strengthened. Its shares advanced 9.2 per cent 
to NKr27.80.
Meanwhile, Vestas Wind rose 1.9 per cent to DKr299.50 after the Danish wind turbine manufacturer said it had won 
an Australian order for 111 turbines, its largest order from that country to date.
France's GDF Suez lost 1.2 per cent to EUR28.61 after it said it planned to raise about $1.5bn in two months to 
finance a power plant in Saudi Arabia it is building with Saudi Electricity.
MTU Aero rose 4.8 per cent to EUR43.71 after Goldman Sachs added the German jet engine maker to its 
"conviction buy" list.

Aer Lingus staff deal averts strike action
Aer Lingus staff deal averts strike action

Aer Lingus, the troubled Irish airline, has averted strike action by agreeing a cost-cutting deal with unions as it 
grapples with widening losses.
The agreement with its workforce is in stark contrast to British Airways, where cabin crew are threatening further 
strike action unless there is progress in a bitter dispute over pay and jobs. Willie Walsh, chief executive of British 
Airways, is the former managing director of Aer Lingus.
Ireland's flagship airline said it had agreed a EUR97m (£80m) cost-savings plan with unions, in spite of earlier 
objections to the deal by cabin crew members.
The agreement includes 670 voluntary redundancies, pay cuts of 5 to 10 per cent and new working conditions.
Aer Lingus said the deal amounted to cutting its cost base by 7.4 per cent, compared with the 2.6 per cent that 
British Airways is pressing for.
The airline added that "it took a lot of independent negotiations, and a lot of talk around the table, but we presented 
a vision and I think the staff realised we had to change to be successful".
Aer Lingus, like most other European airlines, has been struggling to cope with the decline in demand for air travel 
amid the recession.
It has reduced long-haul flights, closed lossmaking routes to US destinations, lowered ticket prices to better meet its 
capacity and deferred the delivery of nine Airbus aircraft.
Aer Lingus staff deal averts strike action
The need for change was underscored on Tuesday after the airline said pre-tax losses had widened 27 per cent 
from EUR122.1m in 2008 to EUR154.8m in the year to December 31.
Revenue fell 11 per cent to EUR1.21bn, driven by a 32 per cent drop in cargo income and a 14 per cent cut in ticket 
prices. Exceptional costs included EUR51.9m in payments to employees losing their jobs. Losses per share 
widened from 20.7 cents to 24.6 cents.
Although trading in the first three months of 2010 has been ahead of the same period last year, the company said 
conditions remained "challenging".
Aer Lingus's difficulties have made it a repeated target for hostile bids from Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost 
airline. The shares rose 2.5 cents to 73.5 cents on Tuesday.

Byline: Kevin Brown in Kuala Lumpur
Body
Tony Fernandes is running late. The chief executive of AirAsia is in Kuala Lumpur briefly between a trip to the UK to 
check on Lotus, his Formula One racing team, and a planned flight to Vietnam to finalise an airline joint venture. 
"I'm glad we don't run the airline on his personal timetable," groans an aide.
When Mr Fernandes arrives, his schedule turns out to be something of a sore point. He has recently been accused 
by Tony Davis, chief executive of Tiger Airways , a Singapore-based rival airline, of losing his focus on AirAsia - the 
region's biggest budget carrier and the world's lowest cost airline - in the excitement of his involvement in motor 
racing. He is clearly eager to hit back.
"Just because one person might only be able to do one thing at a time doesn't mean all of us are the same," he 
says. "I can run an F1 team and run an airline, and ultimately what I'm doing is setting up businesses and putting 
other people in there to run them. Lotus F1 is no different."
In fact, say his staff, Mr Fernandes is being rather modest about his ability to multi-task. A serial entrepreneur who 
has founded four airlines - AirAsia, its long-haul affiliate Air­Asia X and joint ventures in Indonesia and Thailand - he 
is also part-owner, with his long-time business partner Kamarudin Meranun and others, of the privately held Tune 
Group. Tune runs substantial hotel, financial services and mobile phone businesses.
His core interest remains, however, AirAsia, whose spartan headquarters in Kuala Lumpur's low-cost carrier 
terminal, a short drive from the airport, could have been designed as an object lesson in rigid cost control. Bustling 
in from the lift, Mr Fernandes leads the way to his small office in a corner of the airline's open plan administrative 
floor.
A driven man
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
Casually dressed, though without his trademark red baseball cap ("I've had to stop wearing them - people keep 
asking me to sign them."), the 45-year-old talks quickly, with a strong English accent, breaking off every now and 
then to speak to colleagues holding a financial planning meeting a few feet away.
When he bought AirAsia through Tune for a token M$1 plus M$40m debt in 2001, it was a failing state-owned 
regional carrier with two aircraft. Starting with $250,000 in cash, Mr Fernandes has built the airline up to 90 aircraft 
with costs per passenger kilometre lower than both Southwest Airlines of the US, which invented the low-cost 
model, and Ryanair, the Irish group often regarded as the world's most competitive carrier. AirAsia now has a 
market capitalisation of just over $1.1bn (EUR820m, £740m).
It has grown fast thanks to a rigorous focus on keeping down costs, combined with rapid economic growth across 
Asia, the gradual liberalisation of the region's air services and generally low levels of congestion at many Asian 
airports, which speeds up aircraft turnr9ound times. "It's all about keeping costs down," says Mr Fernandes. "We 
are the lowest-cost airline in the world and we will continue to be. That's what I focus on, and if you had sat in our 
budget meeting last week you'd have seen that that's all I talk about."
The Vietnam joint venture, if it goes ahead, would give AirAsia operations in four of the five biggest members of the 
Association of South East Asian Countries, a 10-country grouping with an economy bigger than India's and a 
population of 600m, which is the airline's main target. The fifth country is the Philippines, which Mr Fernandes says 
is still on the agenda.
"The huge advantage that we have . . . is that we are where we are because we have invested in all these 
destinations and now we begin to milk money because the investment has been done over eight years," he says. 
"So if [competitors] want to grow they are going to have put flags everywhere, and every flag they put there's an 
AirAsia flag there already, so they're going to have to compete with an established brand and an established 
competitor. It's like me saying I'm going to go and compete with Ryanair [in Europe] right now. I might as well take a 
gun to my head and shoot myself."
A UK-trained accountant, Mr Fernandes spent his early working life in the music business, as a financial controller 
for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group and, later, as an executive for Warner Music. But it was Sir Stelios Haji-
Ioannou, founder of EasyJet, the low-cost airline, who was responsible for his foray into aviation. Mr Fernandes had 
quit Warner and was watching television in 2001 in London, when he saw Sir Stelios talking about the company. 
Struck by his enthusiasm, Mr Fernandes rushed to EasyJet's base at Luton Airport, video camera in hand, and 
instantly decided to set up an Asian equivalent - a train of events that makes him one of the few people in the world 
to have been inspired at the airport. "Yes, I had a look, and filmed [the aircraft]," he says with a laugh. "But I 
wouldn't say it was the airport [that inspired me]; it was what was in Luton Airport."
Mr Fernandes says his first thought was to start a long-haul low-cost airline flying between Kuala Lumpur and 
London - mainly because of his memories of being unhappy at Epsom College, the English private school where he 
was sent at 12. "You've read all of the Tom Brown's Schooldaysstories]. . . it was like it really was true. So I called 
my mum . . . and I asked, "Can I come home for half term?' And she said, 'No, its just too expensive.' And there in 
my mind was like, 'I must make airlines cheap for people to fly.'"
As it turned out, Epsom College was not so bad, and Mr Fernandes now sends his daughter there. But a business 
plan for the long-haul airline that he had discussed with banks was torn up and replaced with a short-haul plan on 
the advice of Conor McCarthy, a former Ryanair and Aer Lingus executive who is now a director of AirAsia.
The long-haul operation was eventually launched in 2007, but it is one of the ventures that triggered claims Mr 
Fernandes was losing focus. The others are his sporting interests, which include an unsuccessful attempt to buy 
West Ham, the Premiership football club.
A driven man
Mr Fernandes says his sporting activities are separate from AirAsia and have no impact on his management time. 
Lotus, for example, is a private venture managed through the Tune Group, and he says there is no chance AirAsia 
will emerge as a major sponsor for Lotus, even when its current contract with the Williams team runs out after this 
season.
He laughs when asked whether he considered making the investment through the airline. "No, never," he says. 
"Can you imagine going to the stock market saying you're buying a Formula One team? That was never in my 
thought process. Your readers would have a coronary."
Mr Fernandes says shareholders understand the difference between his private and public business activities. But 
there is nevertheless a positive spin-off for AirAsia. "All my activity over the last one-and-a-half months has made 
AirAsia a more famous brand because it's 'Tony Fernandes, founder of AirAsia' all the time."
Mr Fernandes says his initial objective for Lotus - a famous but moribund brand founded by the engineer Colin 
Chapman - was achieved when both cars finished the season's first grand prix in Bahrain. Two major objectives 
remain: ensuring that the cars do at least moderately well in the Malaysian Grand Prix next Sunday, and winning a 
bet with Virgin's Sir Richard that Lotus will end the season ahead of the Virgin team. The two have agreed that the 
loser will serve drinks dressed as an air hostess.
But Mr Fernandes clearly thinks he is on to a winner with Lotus, even if it turns out the joke is on him. "AirAsia is 
exactly like Colin Chapman," he says. "He started with very little money, but he had innovation, and AirAsia is 
exactly like that. We started with two new planes and $250,000. I'm sure many people laughed at us. They're not 
laughing any more."

Strike forces BA to cancel many Heathrow flights
Strike forces BA to cancel many Heathrow flights

British Airways had cancelled 42 per cent of its flights scheduled to leave Heathrow as at lunchtime on Sunday, and 
may have to lose more as it struggles with its second cabin crew strike in a week.
This is fewer than the proportion of cancellations BA suffered on the last day of the first strike that ended last 
Monday, when 47 per cent of its flights out of Heathrow were cancelled, according to calculations based on its 
website's departures board.
The airline has also cut the number of aircraft it has chartered to cope with the walkout, a BA spokesman said.
It hired 25 aircraft from 11 airlines, including Ryanair and Air Finland, for the first strike, which lasted three days. It 
has now 11 hired aircraft, and crew, from six different airlines for the current strike, which started on Saturday and 
ends on Tuesday.
However, Unite, the flight attendants' union organising the stoppage, said the walk-out was having a much bigger 
effect on the airline's operations than BA and its chief executive, Willie Walsh, had admitted.
"Mr Walsh needs to stop claiming that BA is flying more passengers because he isn't," said Len McCluskey, the 
union's assistant general secretary. "Where he can, he is putting BA customers on to other carriers and paying 
heavily for their services in so doing.
"But where BA is trying to fly its own routes it is clear they are failing. Dozens of flights flew yesterday without 
passengers and crew. Dozens more were simply cancelled, and today already over 130 flights will not leave."
The union has threatened further strikes after Easter if the current dispute is not settled.
Strike forces BA to cancel many Heathrow flights
A number of aircraft leaving Heathrow on Sunday were empty, BA confirmed, as they were in the first strike last 
weekend. They are being flown to cities to be in position for returning flights back to London, and will carry air cargo 
in their holds but no paying passengers.
BA declined to say what proportion were empty. "It's a small number," the BA spokesman said.
Flights from London City airport operated normally and crew continued to report for work as normal at Gatwick, as 
was largely the case last weekend.
The airline notified the stock exchange last week it was losing £7m a day because of the industrial action, which 
was prompted after it cut at least one cabin crew member from most of its longhaul flights last November without 
agreement from Unite.
There was still no sign of a resumption of talks to end the increasingly bitter dispute, despite calls from Gordon 
Brown, prime minister, and other ministers for each side to get back to the negotiating table.
The BA strike, plus a threatened national rail stoppage, have caused unease within the Labour government ahead 
of an expected May 6 general election.
Conservative leader David Cameron claimed on Sunday that trade unions "scented weakness" in the government's 
response to Unite's dispute with BA.
He criticised Mr Brown for failing to support crew who had not gone on strike.
"I think a leader should say 'of course, if people want to go to work, they should go to work and I back them going to 
work'," Mr Cameron told BBC television.
"I think the unions have scented weakness in the government and that's one of the reasons why we're seeing quite 
so many strikes."
Mr Brown was highly critical of the strike before it began, describing it as "deplorable" and "unjustified", infuriating 
some cabin crew picketing at Heathrow last week, who said they did not believe Unite should keep backing Labour. 
The union is the party's biggest financial supporter.

It was Henry Gordon Selfridge, founder of London's Selfridges store, who said "the customer is always right". It is 
not the most entertaining quote on the relevant page of the Penguin Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Quotations. 
That belongs to French advertising man Jacques Séguéla, who wrote a book called Don't Tell My Mother I Work in 
Advertising - She Thinks I'm a Piano-player in a Brothel.
But it is Selfridge's quote that has become a business truism. Is it correct? Is the customer always right? The 
question has provoked a debate in the pages of this newspaper, prompted by our recent report that would-be 
drivers of London's black cabs may have to attend mandatory classes in customer service, as well as passing "The 
Knowledge", the famous test of the city's lay-out. The classes will focus on welcoming passengers, dealing with 
disabled customers and, in a business famous for its opinionated talkers, "knowing when to shut up".
The news prompted a sharp letter from Brett Self of Birmingham, Alabama. "For generations people were taught 
that 'the customer is always right'. This axiom is always wrong. However, [suggestions that] the customer is 'king', 
'number one', 'the boss' and - my new favourite - 'the reason we're here' continue to spread their tentacles through 
the banal mentality of management in our modern, worldwide service industry," he wrote.
There are business leaders who agree. In his memoirs, Gordon Bethune, one-time chief executive of Continental 
Airlines of the US, had a section headed "The customer is not always right". Michael O'Leary, boss of Ryanair, the 
Irish low-cost airline, recently went further, telling the Financial Times: "The customer's usually wrong."
You would think their customers would have abandoned them for more sympathetic airlines, but they did not. Mr 
Bethune and Mr O'Leary are two of the most successful chief executives of their generation. Mr Bethune - whose 
book was called From Worst to First - rescued Continental from what had seemed like a terminal dive. Mr O'Leary 
leads one of the most successful airlines in aviation history.
Right or wrong, the customer always matters
Does that mean that not only can you get away with treating your customers badly but that you can thrive on it? No. 
We need to delve a little more deeply.
Mr Bethune certainly worried about customer service, particularly Continental's appalling punctuality record. He told 
staff that every month Continental was in the US top five for on-time arrivals, each employee would receive a $65 
cash bonus.
It was not that Mr Bethune did not understand the importance of happy customers. It was that he knew only 
committed staff would provide the service that would keep them happy. If, in spite of all its efforts, the airline failed 
to perform and a customer became aggressive with an employee, Mr Bethune would always back the employee. 
Why? Because he thought employees would do more for customers if they thought their managers were on their 
side.
Mr O'Leary is more complicated. He seems to go out of his way to antagonise customers, once even threatening to 
charge them to use the toilet. He told this newspaper he did it all for the publicity. The airline spends little on 
advertising.
Mr O'Leary is offering his customers one thing: cheap flights. That, based on Mr O'Leary's relentless drive to cut 
costs, is the airline's central attraction. By constantly telling customers how little he cares about them, Mr O'Leary 
encourages them to concentrate on price alone - and lowers their expectation of receiving anything else. That the 
service is often quite cheerful then seems a bonus. The moment Ryanair's flights become as expensive as a 
traditional airline's, the customers will desert, and Mr O'Leary knows it.
You need to know who your customers are and what you are offering them. If it is rock-bottom prices, you need to 
be cheaper than anyone else. If it is a glitzy department store, glitz is what you have to provide.
And London cab drivers? Their customers never went to them because they cared about their opinions. They went 
to them because they were licensed, safe and knew their way around. The problem is that other providers, minicab 
drivers, can now get licences too, and satellite navigation devices have made "The Knowledge" less of a draw. I am 
not sure customer service lessons will solve the problem. The black cab drivers need to think what else they can 
offer: being around when people leave theatres and pubs perhaps, or even cutting prices.
Customers may not always be right, but they certainly matter. Unless you can give them what your competitors 
cannot, you have no business.

Thousands of British Airways passengers found themselves on Saturday boarding unfamiliar aircraft from carriers 
including no-frills Ryanair and Air Finland as British Airways mounts a huge operation to cope with its first strike in 
13 years.
The Unite union representing more than 12,000 BA cabin crew on Friday night defied calls from Gordon Brown to 
halt the strike and was due to press ahead with three days of industrial action from midnight.Last-minute talks in 
London to try to reach a deal with the airline ended in acrimony on Friday.
On Saturday morning within Terminal 5, service seemed to be running relatively normally, albeit, with staff called, a 
reduced passenger load. Many of the travellers appeared to be foreign holidaymakers.
The picket lines were not located near the passenger entrances and staff dressed in yellow jackets were walking 
the terminal in case of any staff being hassled. One BA staff member said there were concerns that union officials 
were patrolling the airport to take note of who was working.
The threatened strikes in the run-up to the expected May general election is a serious headache for the prime 
minister. The RMT union is considering calling the first national rail strike for 16 years and said signal workers had 
voted for action.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience

BA stays in the air as cabin crew strike
Tony Woodley, Unite's joint leader, said trying to settle with BA had proved "mission impossible". It had been an 
"absolute disgrace" that Willie Walsh, the airline's chief executive, had tabled an offer that contained a worse pay 
deal than that which was offered last week, he said.
"I think this is a classic case of Mr Walsh unfortunately being one of the hawks and looking for a war with our 
members, as opposed to a negotiated settlement," said Mr Woodley.
Mr Walsh denied trying to break the union or avoid a deal. "I've been here for the last three days in direct 
discussions with Tony Woodley," he said, adding he must be "the only chief executive of a FTSE 100 company" to 
have given his mobile phone number to union leaders to try to keep discussions going.
BA believes it will be able to keep 65 per cent of passengers flying thanks to chartered aircraft and 1,000 volunteer 
cabin crew it has trained since it became evident a strike might go ahead over the airline's changes to flight 
attendant working conditions.
Ryanair, normally a feisty opponent, sounded more supportive when asked about the three aircraft it was leasing to 
the UK carrier, saying: "BA is in a fight for survival and the last thing they need is strike action from a greedy union, 
which passengers simply won't tolerate."
Downing Street said: "The prime minister believes that this strike is in no one's interest and will cause unacceptable 
inconvenience to passengers. He urges the strike be called off immediately."
David Cameron, Tory leader, will on Saturday accuse Mr Brown of being "terrified of upsetting the union barons" 
who are "bankrolling the Labour party".

"Cabin crew are reporting as normal at Gatwick and the numbers reporting at Heathrow are above the levels we 
need to operate our published schedule," BA said.
The threatened strikes in the run-up to the expected May general election is a serious headache for the prime 
minister. The RMT union is considering calling the first national rail strike for 16 years and said signal workers had 
voted for action.

Tony Woodley, Unite's joint leader, said trying to settle with BA had proved "mission impossible". It had been an 
"absolute disgrace" that Willie Walsh, the airline's chief executive, had tabled an offer that contained a worse pay 
deal than that which was offered last week, he said.
"I think this is a classic case of Mr Walsh unfortunately being one of the hawks and looking for a war with our

have given his mobile phone number to union leaders to try to keep discussions going.
BA believes it will be able to keep 65 per cent of passengers flying thanks to chartered aircraft and 1,000 volunteer 
cabin crew it has trained since it became evident a strike might go ahead over the airline's changes to flight 
attendant working conditions.
Ryanair, normally a feisty opponent, sounded more supportive when asked about the three aircraft it was leasing to 
the UK carrier, saying: "BA is in a fight for survival and the last thing they need is strike action from a greedy union, 
which passengers simply won't tolerate."
Downing Street said: "The prime minister believes that this strike is in no one's interest and will cause unacceptable 
inconvenience to passengers. He urges the strike be called off immediately."
David Cameron, Tory leader, will on Saturday accuse Mr Brown of being "terrified of upsetting the union barons" 
who are "bankrolling the Labour party".

Thousands of British Airways passengers found themselves on Saturday boarding unfamiliar aircraft from carriers 
including no-frills Ryanairand Air Finland as British Airways mounts a huge operation to cope with its first strike in 
13 years.
The Unite union representing more than 12,000 BA cabin crew on Friday night defied calls from Gordon Brown to 
halt the strike and was due to press ahead with three days of industrial action from midnight.Last-minute talks in 
London to try to reach a deal with the airline ended in acrimony on Friday.
On Saturday morning within Terminal 5, service seemed to be running relatively normally, albeit, with staff called, a 
reduced passenger load. Many of the travellers appeared to be foreign holidaymakers.
The picket lines were not located near the passenger entrances and staff dressed in yellow jackets were walking 
the terminal in case of any staff being hassled. One BA staff member said there were concerns that union officials 
were patrolling the airport to take note of who was working.
In a statement on Saturday, BA said operations at Heathrow and Gatwick have "got off to a good start" and London 
City is operating as normal.
"Cabin crew are reporting as normal at Gatwick and the numbers reporting at Heathrow are above the levels we 
need to operate our published schedule," BA said.

British Airways passengers turning up to Gatwick on Saturday for their 8:20am flight to Edinburgh are in for a slight 
surprise.
The aircraft waiting for them is scheduled to be one of three that BA has leased from its no-frills Irish rival, Ryanair, 
to help it cope with the impact of Saturday's strike. Ryanair flight attendants, who must famously charge for 
everything from a cup of coffee to a sandwich, will also notice a change to their normal routine: they will have to 
serve food and drink free of charge.
"It will be BA service and BA catering," said BA, adding that Ryanair cabin crew had been tutored in what this 
entailed earlier this week.
"We've spoken to each of the crews flying on our behalf and they know what kind of customers we have," the airline 
said.
Ryanair, which has long poked fun at its older flag carrier rival, did not miss an opportunity to take advantage of the 
situation.
"Never mind the coffee - being on time will be a new experience for these passengers," said Stephen McNamara, a 
Ryanair spokesman.
Because it has had nearly three months in which to prepare for Saturday's disruption, BA has had time to charter 
aircraft from 11 airlines around Europe to keep passengers flying, ranging from Ryanair and Portugal's EuroAtlantic 
Airways to Air Finland and the UK VIP charter group, Titan Airways.
Ryanair flies to the rescue
Aircraft from Ryanair will also be used on routes from Gatwick to Glasgow and Manchester.

How do I find out whether my BA flight will take off?Go to British Airway's website, www.ba.com. The home page 
has a section called Cabin Crew Strike that shows all the latest flight information.
Enter your destination or flight number and you should be able to see if the flight is cancelled, running normally, 
going at a different time, or operated by one of the airlines from which BA has chartered aircraft or bought seats for 
the strike.
If you don't have a computer, call 0844 493 0787 between 6am and 8pm. BA may also try to send you updates by 
text or e-mail, if you give them your details.
My flight is cancelled. What should I do next?
Book another flight, find another route or get a refund. BA will repay whatever the ticket cost or try to get you on to 
another flight to a nearby destination, or book you another BA flight - if you dare.
What if the strike is called off over the weekend?
Again, go to the BA website. If the airline is able to reinstate flights, this is where it will put up the information first. 
Even if the strike is halted, it may have to stick with much of the schedule it has now, meaning no flights to South 
America or cities ranging from San Francisco and Los Angeles to Lagos and Johannesburg.
I've looked at www.ba.com and it says my Heathrow flight to Rome is still going but it is being operatedby 
something called Titan Airways. Should I be worried?
Q&A: Passengers redirected to airline website
No. Everyone from Gordon Brown to the England football team has flown on this VIP airline, which describes itself 
as "the UK's most prestigious charter airline" with "superb in-flight service". Titan is one of 11 airlines providing 
stand-in aircraft for the first three days of the strike, all of which BA says must comply with strict UK and European 
safety standards. And one of which is Ryanair.
I'm flying business class but the charter airline BA is flying has no business class cabin. What do I do?
BA says passengers on some shorter European flights may find themselves in this situation. If so, it will pay them 
"downgrade compensation" and a partial refund, and try to seat them at the front of the aircraft.
I'm due to fly during the second strike period, due to last four days from March 27 but BA hasn't said what is 
happening then. What should I do?
The airline says it will publish a schedule online as soon as possible for that period but cannot do so at the moment.
What about the days next week in between the two strike periods? Will they be affected?
BA says there may be some effect on the schedule but it is impossible to say how much at this point. Again, it's 
best to check the website.

It makes no difference whether British Airwayscabin crew goes on strike on Saturday: the damage to the airline and 
its staff's prospects has been done. Six months of dangerous brinksmanship between Willie Walsh, chief executive, 
and the Unite union have given passengers and other stakeholders little certainty that BA's dysfunctional industrial 
relations will ever improve until the current generation of handsomely-paid cabin staff retires. Moreover, BA's 
planned merger with Iberia raises the prospect of awkward labour relations in Spain.
Mr Walsh faces two problems: Unite has no reputation to protect as it hammers another nail into BA's coffin, and 
the call to strike is music to the ears of low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet, and long-haul rivals. Unite 
and Mr Walsh have been locked in a dangerous game in which there can be no clear winner. Passengers, at least, 
have a choice.
BACKGROUND NEWS
Talks between British Airways and the Unite union resumed on Friday in an effort to prevent the company's first 
strike in 13 years which is scheduled to begin on Saturday. Negotiations between the two sides broke up late on 
Thursday after they failed to resolve the row.
Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, and Tony Woodley, joint leader of Unite, spent much of Thursday at the London 
headquarters of the Trades Union Congress. Mr Woodley repeated his call for Mr Walsh to put back an offer 
withdrawn last week that would have reinstated 184 of the cabin crew positions the airline cut last year after taking 
1,000 voluntary redundancies, in a move that prompted the dispute.
Union officials close to the discussions claimed BA was resisting this, in part because the strike threat had already 
cost £27m ($41m) and caused more than 100,000 cancellations - figures BA declined to confirm.

The year of 2008 was one most European smaller companies managers would rather forget and Adrian Bignell, 
manager of the Invesco Perpetual European Smaller Companies fund, is no exception.
The fund was over-exposed to riskier assets in the liquidity squeeze and saw performance slide.
However, it had been a consistent outperformer since Mr Bignell took over management in 2004, and has bounced 
back with the market recovery.
The fund has no specific focus on growth or value and aims to make money out of either type of stock, so long as it 
is undiscovered by the market.
Mr Bignell says: "You need to be holistic and rounded. We love the high quality companies that deliver 15 per cent 
earnings growth per year but, for the most part, that will tend to be priced in so you need to look for turnaround 
stories as well."
He sees himself as a natural contrarian and says he tends to be early to buy and sell.
He believes the fund should be "all-weather", rather than doing well in one type of market over another.
He says smaller companies tend to have simpler business models and are largely easier to understand than large-
cap conglomerates.
The macro analysis will look at the business cycle and assess the most appropriate sectors for each stage, which 
also informs the country bias.
Timely move into and out of risk aids rebound
Mr Bignell adds: "Norway, for example, is more exposed to oil and commodities.
"Germany is focused on capital goods and chemicals and then the euro is a strong determinant for exports.
"Spain is about utilities and banks."
The fund is in positive territory so far this year, and had a good 2009, outperforming the market by 6.4 percentage 
points.
But 2008 saw the fund fall 53.7 per cent, compared with a 35.4 per cent decline for the HSBC European Smaller 
Companies ex UK index.
The pick-up in 2009 came from a timely move into - and back out of - higher-risk areas.
Mr Bignell says: "Last year we started buying into cyclicals and financials in the first and second quarter, which 
stood us in good stead for the rally. At this point, no one wanted to touch these areas and many of the stocks were 
priced as if they would go bust. We also did well at the end of the year, when our macro analysis ensured we 
rotated back into defensive areas."
Mr Bignell is maintaining his defensive tilt, looking for quality growth and winners in individual industries, such as 
Ryanair, which is benefiting from the disintegration of its rivals.
He says industries such as airlines are consolidating; weaker companies are being forced out - either losing so 
much money they cannot afford to compete on price, or being taken out by companies attracted by the low cost of 
debt.

British Airways staff have voted to strike over a long-running dispute with the troubled flag carrier.
"Good Morning. Welcome to scheduled flight BA01789 from London Heathrow to New York JFK. This is your 
captain, Charles Suave, speaking. We are currently travelling at a speed of zero knots and an altitude of no feet 
whatsoever above the ground.
"You may think that the aircraft has been sitting motionless on the tarmac for hours because we have been awaiting 
a take-off slot. We haven't. The crew are holding a union meeting.
"That gives me time to fill you in on what you can see from the windows. Passengers on the left have a fine view of 
the main runway. Notice how many aircraft operated by low-cost carriers are taking off and landing.
"Passengers on the right can see the offices of British Airways. If you really strain your eyes, you may even glimpse 
a tiny figure in a corner office jumping up and down and tearing his hair out. That's Willie Walsh, the chief executive.
"Inflight catering today would have been led by senior stewardess Samantha Blusher. But Sam is taking a duvet 
day. She says BA simply isn't the airline that she joined back in '92, what with the understaffing, the pay freeze and 
the expenses cuts. If you're getting peckish, try asking fellow passengers to share their boiled sweets.
"Now, co-pilot Henry Dashing, who is also the shop steward, has just given me an update. It's one out, all out, 
apparently. So I'll just radio for a bus to take you back to the terminal. It only remains to me to wish you well with 
your onward journeys. Ryanair is a good bet, in my experience. Thank you for trying to fly BA. Not enough people 
do these days. And that's the whole problem."
T5 is working but BA won't be
Shepherd's pie guy
City darling Justin King, the boss of Sainsbury, has taken a swipe at metal bashers. He suggested that the 
government should do more to support the crucial national asset that is food manufacturing and less to prop up 
"industries that don't have good reason to exist".
However politicians are evangelical about engineering for good mercenary reasons. If more machines were 
exported the yawning trade gap would narrow. It would be splendid if Sainsbury could help out by shipping 
chocolate eclairs produced in its bakeries to China. But one suspects that the Chinese could bake chocolate éclairs 
themselves, if that was what they wanted.
Mr King pooh-poohed worries over the falling share of UK components in the classic British JCB digger. 
Appropriately, a consumer group then revealed that Sainsbury's "British Classics" shepherd's pie is often made with 
New Zealand lamb.
Flying Reliant
Road vehicles that can soar aloft are an old fantasy of inventors. The latest contender seeking to make the pipe 
dream a reality is Samson Motorworks of California. The company's sleek design for a flying three-wheeler deploys 
a neat feature: hinged wings that tuck away under the chassis when not in use. An inquisitive three-year-old 
passenger, one trusts, would be unable to trigger the retract mechanism.
The Samson Switchblade faces a problem that defeated previous attempts to market dual purpose vehicles. Design 
compromises meant that they were unsatisfactory both as cars and aircraft.
Older Britons may meanwhile discern in the Switchblade a sexy, stretched cousin of the discontinued Reliant Robin. 
This three-wheeler - which could neither fly nor travel very fast on the ground - was classified as a motorcycle for 
the same reason as the Switchblade: to reduce red tape. It was known as "The Plastic Pig". The saying "pigs might 
fly" therefore has some relevance for the Switchblade.
I, Robot
Staff at the Department for Work and Pensions in Carlisle have complained that they were required to impersonate 
answering machines. Managers told them to answer phone calls during lunch hours with the scripted words "Due to 
the high volume of inquiries we are currently experiencing, we are unable to take your call. Please call back later." 
Then they were supposed to hang up. Civil servants sometimes complain that bosses view them as unthinking 
automata. This proves it.

Ireland plans automatic pension scheme enrolment
Ireland plans automatic pension scheme enrolment

Ireland has adopted an idea from behavioural economics to tackle the problem of private sector pension coverage, 
with reforms announced last week that will see low and middle income workers automatically enrolled in a pension 
scheme.
Pete Lund, an economist at Dublin's Economic and Social Research Institute, says auto enrolment is an example of 
the default option - a concept borrowed from behavioural economics, but now familiar across businesses from the 
way the French and Germans donate organs to Ryanair's policy on travel insurance on its website.
In the pensions industry it is now common in US private sector retirement savings schemes. At government level 
the model has been used in New Zealand's Kiwisaver, and is to be introduced in the UK with the National 
Employment Savings Trust (Nest) product, a national workplace scheme expected to be rolled out from 2012.
Under the Irish plan, all workers over 22 who are not in an existing plan will be automatically enrolled, and will have 
to contribute 4 per cent of their salary to a scheme. They are free to opt out after three months. However, they will 
be re-enrolled every two years.
Employers will have to make a mandatory contribution of EUR1 for every EUR2 set aside by the worker. The state 
too will contribute EUR1, equivalent to tax relief at 33 per cent. This replaces the current system where those in 
pension plans enjoy relief at the marginal tax rates, either 20 or 41 per cent.
The aim is to address Ireland's looming pensions time-bomb. The country will see the number of pensioners treble 
by 2050, with the cost of state pensions rising from 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product today to 15.5 per cent.
Ireland plans automatic pension scheme enrolment
Private sector pensions have been ravaged by the global financial crisis. The vast bulk of Ireland's defined benefit 
schemes, covering around 500,000 workers, no longer meet the minimum solvency standard set by the Irish 
pensions regulator, with industry forecasts that 40 per cent will be forced to close.
However, the thrust of the latest reform is targeted at those who have no private pension cover, relying solely on the 
basic state pension to see them through retirement. This group accounts for half the working population. The 
problem is particularly acute among younger people, with 63 per cent of those under the age of 30 having no plan.
Michael Madden, actuarial partner at Mercer in Dublin, says the product will be no different from an employer 
sponsored plan, although he suggested the mandatory nature of the scheme "places a greater onus of care on the 
government".
He points out that although the government says there is no guarantee of the investment returns, the scheme will 
be administered by the state, with the money collected via the Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) system, 
Ireland's social insurance system.
Most analysts agree the scheme should result in increased coverage, but some question whether it will meet the 
adequacy test. The investment assumptions are seen as too optimistic. The government calculates the scheme will 
provide a worker on EUR30,000 (£27,000, $41,000) with a pension equivalent to 58 per cent of salary.
In the past, opposition from the finance department has been the stumbling block to pension reform. But it was 
significant that Mary Hanafin, the family and social affairs minister was accompanied at last Wednesday's press 
conference by both Brian Cowen, the Taoiseach (the Irish prime minister) and Brian Lenihan, the finance minister.
However all three ministers stress the reforms will only take effect when economic conditions allow and not before 
2014 at the earliest. The concern is that to administer the changes now would not only put additional costs on 
business but could stoke wage inflation at a time when the government is endeavouring to restrain wages to restore 
Ireland's export competitiveness.

Stock pickers caught by surprise

Aviva Investors' European equity head John Botham has said many fund managers have been caught by surprise 
after macroeconomic factors continued to drive markets this year.
The manager said many 'stock picker' fund managers - who base investment decisions on individual company 
factors rather than on top-down macro drivers - expected to return to the fore in 2010.
"But the last six weeks have shown, with the sovereign debt crisis in Greece, that this has not been the case," Mr 
Botham said.
"In reality, macroeconomic, top-down influences come and go, and as a fund manager, you need the full skill set."
The manager said the correction seen across European markets this year was due in large part to the problems in 
Greece.
The country's battle with debt has sparked fears other eurozone governments will hike interest rates and remove 
stimulus measures more quickly than was expected to avoid falling into a Greece-style crisis.
"What has changed over the last three months is that, while all participants in the markets understood there would 
be fiscal tightening this year, this fact has been brought to much greater contrast with things like Greece," Mr 
Botham said.
"There is a sense adjustments must occur much more quickly, and that growth in western Europe will be slower 
than it would have been."
Stock pickers caught by surprise
But Mr Botham, who joined Aviva in September 2007, said there were still stocks he expected to deliver 
outperformance this year on his high-conviction portfolio.
The manager is targeting areas like media and advertising agencies, which suffered during the financial crisis as 
companies cut their marketing spending.
He favours Havas, France's second-largest advertising group, which earlier this month announced more moderate 
revenue falls than in previous quarters in a sign of improvement for the sector.
And the manager is targeting Telecinco - the privately owned Spanish television station - saying recent regulatory 
shifts had triggered a wave of consolidation in the industry.
"The free-to-air broadcaster is not allowed to have advertising any more," the manager said. "So the pay networks 
have taken it all."
He is also targeting recession-battered airlines including Ryanair and Air France, which he said were at good 
valuations compared with their historical averages.
Mr Botham navigated the financial crisis to deliver a first-quartile loss of 19.5 per cent in 2008 and a second-quartile 
20.7 per cent return in 2009 on the group's flagship Aviva Investors European Equity fund.
The £189m fund has reported a first-quartile return over three years of 10.6 per cent, versus an average return from 
funds in the IMA Europe excluding UK sector of just 1.4 per cent.

Lufthansa suffers loss in aviation downturn
Lufthansa suffers loss in aviation downturn

Lufthansa is to skip paying a dividend after reporting a EUR112m net loss for 2009, even though the German airline 
still managed to achieve its target of an operating profit.
Last year's loss, which followed a net profit of EUR542m in 2008, reflected the severe impact of the worst downturn 
in commercial aviation history. It set a gloomy backdrop as Lufthansa management attempts to avert further strike 
action by its pilots. Revenues tumbled last year by 10 per cent to EUR22.3bn.
However, Lufthansa - Europe's largest airline by revenues - provided a positive surprise with a higher-than-
expected EUR130m in operating profits, down from EUR1.3bn in the previous year. The airline gave no further 
details ahead of publication of its full annual results on March 11.
Lufthansa has been on an acquisition drive in its push to become an integrated European airline, taking over British 
Midland and Austrian Airlines. But the downturn, and competition from low-cost carriers such as Ryanair, has 
created strong crosswinds for its strategy, which has focused largely on catering for higher-paying passengers.
Last October Lufthansa had warned that its earnings targets faced "very considerable risks" because of oil price 
rises and weak passenger demand.
British Airways last month also bucked expectations by producing better-than-expected results for the three months 
to the end of December, although Willie Walsh, its chief executive, warned that BA still expected to report "record 
losses" over the full financial year. Air France-KLM, however, disappointed financial markets with a worse-than-
expected EUR245m operating loss for the same period.
Lufthansa suffers loss in aviation downturn
Lufthansa in February faced one of the worst industrial conflicts in recent German history, when Cockpit, the trade 
union, called on more than 4,000 pilots to take part in a four day strike. The action was averted after 24 hours when 
Lufthansa and Cockpit agreed to return to negotiations. But Cockpit could resume the strike when the deadline for 
talks expires on Monday.
The trade union is seeking job guarantees for its members and argues that pay and conditions have been 
undermined by Lufthansa's increasing reliance on foreign subsidiaries. But Lufthansa argues Cockpit's demand 
would interfere with management decision-making. It has put the cost of each day's strike at EUR25m.

BAA wins appeal over airports break-up

BAA can keep Stansted, Glasgow and Edinburgh airports, a tribunal ruled on Thursday, as the UK's biggest airports 
operator scored a win in its fight against an antitrust watchdog order to break itself up.
The Competition Commission, which claims BAA's near-monopoly over Britain's biggest airports is harming 
passengers' interests, is to appeal against the judgment in a process that could take many months.
Ryanair, the biggest airline operating from Stansted, warned that the decision by the Competition Appeal Tribunal 
could end up deferring future sales of BAA airports "for a minimum of two years".
Any delay will give BAA, owner of Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, valuable strategic breathing space even if it 
ends up being forced to sell the other airports.
The decision will add to questions about the commission's effectiveness after reversals in cases involving large 
companies, including Barclays and Tesco.
The commission ruled in March last year that BAA, a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial infrastructure group, should sell 
Gatwick, Stansted and either Edinburgh or Glasgow airports to meet competition concerns.
BAA sold Gatwick for £1.5bn, which was less than it might have received if the sale had not taken place during the 
downturn.
It then won an initial appeal to the CAT in December after complaining  the commission was guilty of "apparent 
bias" because Professor Peter Moizer, a member of the panel which ordered its break-up, was also an adviser to a 
pension fund linked to Manchester Airport Group, a potential buyer of its airports.
BAA wins appeal over airports break-up
It had been hoped this would lead to an agreed settlement of the row.
However, the commission decided to appeal; the CAT on Friday denied that appeal. The commission will now seek 
a ruling from the Court of Appeal.
Ryanair, an ardent supporter of BAA's break-up, said it would have been more sensible to deal with BAA's claim by 
banning Manchester Airport Group from bidding for Stansted or either of the Scottish airports. The appeal tribunal 
decision "appears to be based on a legal technicality, or irrelevancy," said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief 
executive.
The commission's original investigation into BAA took nearly two years and if its appeal against the tribunal now 
fails, it could take another two years for it to reinvestigate BAA.
The commission said the tribunal's latest judgment was "not a great surprise".
BAA reported on Monday it had suffered a £822m pre-tax loss last year, in part because of the forced sale of 
Gatwick.

Boeing looks to overtake Airbus again

Boeing should take back its crown as the world's biggest civil aircraft maker from Airbus, its European rival, within 
four years, according to the head of the US group's commercial aircraft business.
Boeing, maker of the 747 jumbo jet, the 777 twin-engined longhaul aircraft and the best-selling 737 shorthaul jet, 
lost the top spot to Airbus in 2003, when the European manufacturer overtook its US rival for the first time.
Since then, Boeing has secured more orders than Airbus in some of the years as it started to market its new 787 
Dreamliner, but Airbus has had the upper hand on deliveries each year. Last year, the European aircraft maker 
delivered 498 jets to Boeing's 481.
That may be about to change, according to Jim Albaugh, who took over as head of Boeing's commercial aircraft 
division last September.
"As we start delivering the 787 on top of the already pretty robust 737 and 777 lines . .  . you're going to see the 
number of deliveries we have in 2013 and 2014 go up significantly from where they are today," he told the Financial 
Times.
"We might deliver a few more airplanes than them [Airbus] in that time frame," he said, referring to 2013-14 and 
beyond.
Mr Albaugh's remarks reflect a new confidence at Boeing after getting its much-delayed 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 
freighter airborne in December and last week respectively.
Boeing looks to overtake Airbus again
Referring to the fierce rivalry between Airbus and Boeing, Mr Albaugh said that people often urged him to take on 
the European company more aggressively.
"They say 'let's go capture market share' and I say, 'that's easy, just give airplanes away'. We're not going to do 
that. We walked away from some orders that we could have had in 2009 because we thought we could sell those 
airplanes for more when the cycle comes back in 2012 and 2013. You can't get so focused on a deal that you do a 
deal that doesn't make good economic sense for the company."
Asked if he was referring to the failed talks with Ireland's no-frills giant, Ryanair, which wanted to buy up to 200 new 
737 aircraft from Boeing last year, Mr Albaugh said he was "just talking about deals in general".
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, complained after talks broke down about dealing with "a bunch of 
numpties out in Seattle".

EasyJet handcuffs bizarre way to run airline

EasyJet shareholders would surely empathise with Robert Evans, a slender traveller whose trip to St Petersburg 
was marred by his super-sized neighbour's spreading, uh, assets. "This," local reports quoted him saying, "isn't 
right."
Investors' concern is that EasyJet's fat cats are taking up an unduly large share of the discount airline's revenue: 
some 50m shares were voted against directors' remuneration at Thursday's annual meeting.
That was insufficient to block the awards but enough to give executives pause. So it should. EasyJet's board spent 
much of the past year squabbling over expansion plans before walking off in a huff. Andy Harrison, prevailed upon 
to remain a while longer in the pilot's seat, is set to pocket an additional £1.2m pay-off when he finally steps down 
this summer.
Paying up to keep people who are strategically at odds with each other is a bizarre way to run an airline, or anything 
else for that matter. Mr Harrison follows four other board members who had headed for the exit. News of his own 
departure came after a compromise on capacity growth: less than management wanted but higher than founder and 
non-executive director Stelios Haji-Ioannou was angling for. While Mr Harrison works out his notice Mr Haji-
Ioannou's attentions have switched, at least partially, to defending himself against the "inappropriate, inaccurate 
and personal attacks" by rival Ryanair. A new finance director joins in June and EasyJet claims progress finding a 
replacement for Mr Harrison.
To be fair, EasyJet's captains have succeeded in generating profits and returns in an ugly year; something not 
many airlines can trumpet. But they should listen to their not-so-silent minority: golden handcuffs to keep 
malcontents on board is about as welcome as being wedged into economy class beside the fattest man on the 
plane.

Halfords'll fix it
Coming soon to a block near you: spruced up car mechanics. Halfords, having snapped up Britain biggest 
independent car repair and servicing group, is putting its foot down full throttle and plans to double the Nationwide 
Autocentres chain to more than 400 outlets.
There is much to like about the deal. It is not excessively priced. The £73m tag equates to a historic enterprise 
value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 7.2 times, according to Investec. That is just 
a whisper above where peers trade, proving that you can buy from private equity without being taken to the 
cleaners. It is strategic, offering the cycle and car parts group an opportunity to further plunder its client base and 
gain a few synergies. Halfords reckons the acquisition will be earnings accretive to the tune of 6 per cent from the 
coming fiscal year. By year three it aims to double earnings before interest and tax at the car servicing chain, partly 
through new outlets, to about £20m.
The deal also brings some consolidation to a horribly fragmented industry; leader Nationwide has a 1 per cent 
market share. The number of repair shops is steadily falling by about 1,000 a year despite the fact that 33m 
vehicles continue to ply the roads. With luck, Halfords will bring a bit more professionalism, greater availability of 
parts - and less shaking of heads over filthy mugs of tea. Some risks attach. Halfords has been here before, under 
Boots' ownership, and botched it. Targets are ambitious, especially since Nationwide has already been growing at a 
compound annual growth rate of 15 per cent. Rolling out 20-30 new outlets a year is tough, as plenty of retailers 
know. Securing and retaining labour is a whole new game for Halfords, which has traditionally made its money from 
marking up inventory. But as far as making money from old cars goes, this should pass its MOT.
Gloomy BAE prognosis
BAE Systems has waded into the Babcock/ VT/Mouchel three-way battle - albeit tangentially. Unveiling dismal 
annual results Europe's biggest defence contractor warned of tough times ahead, with defence budgets in the UK 
and US likely to come under further pressure. Underlining weak growth prospects, it plans to hand £500m back to 
shareholders via a share buy-back. This is bunkum to Babcock, gunning for rival VT in part because it believes 
contractors will be re-fuelling nuclear submarines and servicing defenders of the realm so long as - well, there's a 
monarch on the throne. As for pay-outs, the only cash it wants to distribute is the £233m sitting on VT's balance 
sheet. Defence companies tend to stick to their guns; both Babcock and VT have made several forays on their 
targets. A gloomy prognosis from BAE won't prompt any surrenders.

Determined drive to get middle classes on the buses

The middle classes are on the buses and Brian Souter can barely contain his delight. The plain-talking Scotsman 
who heads the bus and rail company Stagecoach sees pound signs every time a time-pressed, white-collar worker 
takes a seat.
"We've destigmatised the buses and got the middle classes to use them - intelligently, along with their cars," he 
says.
The shift in patronage is good news for Mr Souter, the former bus conductor who went from owning a couple of 
second-hand buses in 1980 to a transport empire with a market value of £1.26bn ($1.97bn) this year.
Ever since he heard the adage that anyone over the age of 30 who used a bus could consider themselves a failure 
- often attributed to Margaret Thatcher -  Mr Souter has set out to prove it wrong.
But while Mr Souter succeeded in building one of the world's largest public transport operators, carrying 2.5m 
passengers a day in the UK, US and Canada, the middle classes had remained stubbornly resistant to buses, 
traditionally viewed as the  choice of the poor.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
Mr Souter's success in broadening the customer base has been most extensive in the south of England. Passenger 
numbers on Stagecoach's British buses have risen by an average 3.4 per cent during the past five years, against 
an industry average of 0.4 per cent, excluding London.
Determined drive to get middle classes on the buses
But in Cambridge the number of passengers on its buses has doubled, and in Oxford buses now account for more 
than half of all journeys.
Some of Mr Souter's work is being done for him. Britain's roads are reaching gridlock, the rail infrastructure is 
creaking, pensioners have been granted free travel and the government is keen to burnish its green credentials by 
prising travellers out of their cars.
But Mr Souter has also pursued white-collar workers deliberately. First there was an advertising campaign with the 
slogan "you'd be surprised who you meet on the buses" by East is East director Damien O'Donnell.
Then it launched the leather-seated Stagecoach Gold brand in Cheltenham, Farnborough and Aldershot - a 
concession to the more exacting tastes of its new clientele who, as Mr Souter says, "are more difficult customers 
than the socially marginalised".
More recently it has benefited from the "Aldi effect" when cash-strapped consumers shook off the stigma associated 
with bargain-basement deals.
Megabus, its no-frills bus service that prices tickets for as little as £1 a seat, has been such a success that Mr 
Souter is convinced the model - dubbed the Ryanair of the buses - should be followed everywhere.
"Everyone accepts yield management systems for airlines, but they need to accept it for buses and trains," he says.
This means that even as pre-tax profits have been hurt by the credit crunch - falling 28 per cent to £75.5m in the six 
months to October 2009 - bus passenger numbers continued to rise, up 3.6 per cent in 2008 and 3.2 per cent in 
2009.
Mr Souter has also tried to expand in other ways. Two successive attempts to acquire National Express operations 
failed last year. But Mr Souter says a deal - or at least a full-scale merger - is no longer on the cards.
"There wouldn't be the same value in it. It would be too expensive," he says. "They didn't have a management team 
at the time so it would have been easy. We feel the opportunity has passed."
But while rivals such as Arriva are looking to Europe to expand, Mr Souter is unlikely to follow suit, in spite of his 
experience running buses in Portugal and Sweden. "Some countries are too prescriptive," he says. "You can't bring 
your commercial expertise to a business if the rules are too tight."
As for the Competition Commission's inquiry into the bus industry, Mr Souter is characteristically scathing. "We just 
don't understand it. It's a completely open market. If one bus company doesn't turn up on time, another company 
can."
Such a reaction may be understandable from a company the Monopolies and Mergers Commission once described 
as "predatory, deplorable and against the public interest". But while Stagecoach was admonished in its early days, 
Mr Souter says he is "much better behaved now".
"If you're the first one over the trenches, you take all the trophies and the casualties," he says. "We set the ground 
rules in the 1980s and 1990s."
Mr Souter's pioneering spirit is not quenched yet. Recent tests of the first "amphibious" bus service on the Clyde 
ran into difficulties when its vehicle - which is part-bus, part-boat - was grounded after suspension airbags worked 
loose on its trial run. But he is convinced it will work in the long term.
Such innovation may be needed to compete with the industry's biggest rival - the car, favoured by the white-collar 
customers he is pursuing. "We are fighting to get market share from minicabs and cars. If we price too high, people 
will jump in a taxi."

Ryanair yesterday said it saw no sign of a pick-up in demand in Ireland or the UK, unlike many other countries on 
the continent.
The comments from Europe's largest low-cost airline came as it raised full-year profit guidance and reported a 
much smaller-than-expected third-quarter net loss, sending its shares up 7 per cent.
"We're seeing demand return, not quite to pre-2009 levels yet, in places like Germany, Scandinavia, Italy, France 
and Spain. They're moving back up," said Michael Cawley, deputy chief executive of Ryanair. "In Britain, 
particularly in provincial Britain, and Ireland, there's no sign of that yet."
Ryanair said its quarterly net loss was EUR10.9m ($15.1m) and that its yields, or average fare levels, had been 
better than expected, which should continue into the fourth quarter.
"As a consequence, we have now increased our full-year net profit guidance to EUR275m," said Michael O'Leary, 
Ryanair chief executive, who added that conditions for airlines were "still pretty tough". The airline had previously 
forecast its full-year net profit would be at the lower end of the EUR200m-EUR300m range.
"The environment out there is, from Ryanair's perspective, great, because it's awful," Mr O'Leary told analysts. 
"We're doing remarkably well because this is the time when the lowest cost producer wins. That doesn't mean the 
world has changed andeverything is fantastic."
Yields at Ryanair still fell by 12 per cent over the quarter but this was an improvement on the 20 per cent fall it had 
previously forecast. The airline said it thought the full-year yield decline would now be closer to 15 per cent, not the 
20 per cent it had predicted.
Ryanair lifts guidance after losses narrow
The improvement had come as Ryanair cut loss-making routes in the UK and Ireland and replaced them with more 
profitable ones in France, Germany and Spain.
It also managed to cut operating costs per passenger by 4 per cent, even though it saw a 3 per cent increase in 
average flight distance, which normally pushes costs up.
Mr Cawley said Ryanair planned to open 146 new routes in 2010 and would see "unprecedented" passenger 
growth, with 66m passengers this year and an estimated 73m in 2011.
Joe Gill, analyst for Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin, said the results were very promising. "In producing numbers 
like these, Ryanair will reignite optimism among those who believe the planned EUR800m profit in 2012 can be 
achieved," he said.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair expected to increase market share as a result of the demise of several carriers in the past 
few months. "We expect further casualties this winter," he added.
Its shares rose 7 per cent to EUR3.58.

There is no sign of a pick-up in demand in Ireland or the UK, unlike many other countries on the Continent, a top 
executive at Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline said yesterday.
"We're seeing demand return, not quite to pre-2009 levels yet, in places like Germany, Scandinavia, Italy, France 
and Spain. They're moving back up," said Michael Cawley, deputy chief executive of Ryanair, Europe's biggest no-
frills carrier by passenger numbers. "In Britain, particularly in provincial Britain, and Ireland, there's no sign of that 
yet."
Mr Cawley was speaking as Ryanair shares jumped 7 per cent after the airline raised its full-year profit guidance 
and reported a much smaller net loss than expected for its third quarter of EUR10.9m (£9.5m).
Analysts had forecast that a combination of bad winter weather and tumbling demand would have pushed the 
airline into a third-quarter net loss of about EUR35m.
The airline had previously forecast its full-year net profit would be at the lower end of the EUR200m-EUR300m 
range. But yesterday Ryanair said its yields, or average fare levels, had been better than expected in the three 
months to December.
"As a consequence, we have now increased our full-year net profit guidance to EUR275m," said Michael O'Leary,

Yields at Ryanair still fell 12 per cent over the quarter, but this was an improvement on the 20 per cent fall it had

than the 20 per cent it had previously predicted.

Ryanair has raised its full-year profit guidance after reporting a much smaller loss than expected for its third quarter.
Europe's biggest no-frills airline had previously forecast a full-year net profit in the lower end of the EUR200-
EUR300m range. But on Monday the company said its yields, or average fare levels, had been better than 
expected in the three months to December and should continue into the fourth quarter.
"As a consequence, we have now increased our full-year net profit guidance to EUR275m," said the airline's chief

previously forecast. The airline said it thought the full-year yield decline would now be closer to 15 per cent, rather 
than the 20 per cent it had previously predicted.
Analysts had forecast that a combination of bad winter weather and slumping demand would have pushed the 
airline into a third-quarter net loss of about EUR35m, but Ryanair instead reported a net loss of EUR10.9m.
Mr O'Leary said this result was still "disappointing", but much better than the EUR101.5m loss reported for the 
same quarter a year ago.
Joe Gill, analyst for Dublin-based Bloxham stockbrokers, said the numbers were very promising.
"In producing numbers like these, Ryanair will reignite optimism among those who believe the planned EUR800m 
profit in 2012 can be achieved," he wrote in a note.
Ryanair lifts guidance after losses narrow
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair expected to increase market share as a result of the demise of several carriers in the last 
few months, including Flyglobespan in the UK and Blue Wings in Germany. "We expect further casualties this 
winter," he added.
He confirmed that Ryanair's talks with US manufacturer Boeing on an order of up to 200 new aircraft had been 
terminated and there was "no plan to re-open these discussions".
As a result, Ryanair is still on track to see its gross capital expenditure fall annually from EUR1.2bn in the 2010 
financial year to about EUR100m in 2014, generating up to EUR1bn in surplus cash by the end of 2013, which it 
plans to distribute to shareholders.
Shares in Ryanair climbed more than 5 per cent in early Dublin trading to EUR3.52.

Ryanair has raised its full-year profit guidance after reporting a much smaller loss than expected for its third quarter.
Europe's biggest no-frills airline had previously forecast a full-year net profit in the lower end of the range of 
EUR200 to EUR300m. But said on Monday its yields, or average fare levels, had been better than expected in the 
three months to December and should continue into the fourth quarter.
"As a consequence, we have now increased our full-year net profit guidance to EUR275m," said the airline's chief 
executive, Michael O'Leary.
Yields at Ryanair still fell by 12 per cent over the quarter, but this was an improvement on the 20 per cent fall it had 
previously forecast. The airline said it thought the full-year yield decline would now be closer to 15 per cent, rather 
than the 20 per cent it had previously predicted.
Analysts had forecast that a combination of bad winter weather and slumping demand would have pushed the 
airline into a third quarter net loss of around EUR35m but Ryanair has instead reported a net loss of EUR10.9m.
Mr O'Leary said this result was still "disappointing", but much better than the EUR101.5m loss reported for the 
same three months a year ago.
Joe Gill, analyst for Dublin-based Bloxham stockbrokers, said the numbers were very promising.

There are perhaps only three things extravagant about Ryanair: its appetite for cost cuts; its valuation; and its ability 
to generate cash. The first saw Europe's largest budget airline turn in a better-than-forecast set of results on 
Monday. Chief executive Michael O'Leary continued to chop out expenses during the third quarter - mostly from 
staff and airport charges. As a result passenger yields fell less than expected, so too profits, and Mr O'Leary 
boosted earnings guidance for the year to EUR275m versus earlier forecasts closer to EUR200m. The shares leapt 
by as much as 6 per cent.
Then there is the Dublin-based carrier's valuation. At 19 times earnings, or around twice book value, Ryanair does 
not enjoy a hefty premium to the broader European market, which trades at around 17 times 2009 earnings. The 
stock even suffers a discount to its historic price-to-book average of around 2.7 times, according to Credit Suisse. 
Nonetheless, this represents a whopping premium to most European airlines. If there is any value to be had, it is 
only relative.
Finally there is Ryanair's ability to spew out cash. Until recently, this was veiled by its rapid growth. Indeed, with 
around 10 per cent of the European market, there is still room for Ryanair to grow further. After all, Southwest 
Airlines, the US budget carrier on which Ryanair's model is based, has 18 per cent of its home market. But Ryanair 
recently had a recent change of heart after a rumpus with Boeing, and money once destined to be spent on 200 
new planes will supposedly be returned to shareholders instead - as much as EUR1bn by 2014. With a fair wind, 
Ryanair could conceivably have another EUR1bn to distribute by 2016. That would make EUR2bn handed back to 
investors over six years, a 40 per cent yield. That is pretty extravagant too.

European airlines were higher on Monday, lifted by broker upgrades as the sector began announcing earnings and 
traffic data.
Irish airline Ryanair rose more than 6 per cent in early trade, after the company raised its full-year profit forecast 
and reported narrower-than-expected third-quarter losses. Ryanair shares pared gains by midday, but remained up 
5.7 per cent to EUR3.54.
Europe's biggest low-cost airline said that although market conditions remained tough, the company was still 
gaining market share from leading European carriers Lufthansa, Air France and British Airways. Lufthansa added 
0.8 per cent to EUR11.72.
Air France rose 0.7 per cent to EUR11.92 and British Airways advanced 3.2 per cent to 212.7p, all benefiting from a 
Goldman Sachs upgrade of the European airline sector.
Meanwhile, merger hopes also helped lift the sector, as the planned global tie-up between BA, American Airlines 
and Iberia moved closer to securing a regulatory green light in Europe. Iberia gained 2.2 per cent to EUR2.25.
Investors kept their eyes on the deal, as both BA and the European Commission, Europe's top antitrust watchdog, 
confirmed on Sunday that competition officials were in talks with rival airlines such as Virgin Atlantic about the 
concessions the three carriers had offered to address potential anti-competitive consequences of the deal.
Finnair rose 1.6 per cent to EUR3.89, Aer Lingus advanced 1.5 per cent to EUR0.67 and budget airline EasyJet 
added 2.2 per cent to 399.8p on the back of a broker upgrade.
Airline sector buoyed by bullish signals
Elsewhere, the International Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade body, announced on Sunday that 
last year, for the first time, air travel in the Asia-Pacific region surpassed North America, with China emerging as the 
world's strongest single aviation market.
The data showed that the region, which includes Australia and New Zealand but not the Middle East, had taken 
more than 25 per cent of the world passenger aviation market.
Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong added 3.8 per cent to HK$13.28, while Singapore Airlines advanced 0.3 per cent to 
S$13.86

Observers hit 'profitless growth' of airlines

Body
As aviation executives gather for the annual Singapore air show, which gets under way on Tuesday, it is easy to 
spot the people who run the Asia Pacific region's low-cost carriers - they are the ones who are smiling.
The global background is grim. Giovanni Bisignani, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, 
forecast in Singapore on Monday that global revenues would fall by $60bn this year on top of $80bn in 2009.
Full service carriers everywhere are struggling to stay afloat, with Japan Airlines succumbing to bankruptcy only last 
month. In contrast, the region's low-cost airline sector is buzzing with passenger growth and network expansion 
plans.
Singapore's Tiger Airways, which has just completed the first initial public offering of an Asian airline in five years, 
on Monday announced its 21st consecutive quarter of increased passenger growth.
Meanwhile, Malaysia's AirAsiaplans to add five Indian cities this year to the four it serves already, and Cebu Pacific 
of the Philippines is claiming its fifth successive year of 30 per cent growth in passengers.
All are profitable, along with many of the region's 20 or so other no-frills airlines, which have sprung up in the past 
decade as the low-cost airline model spread globally from its origins in the US in the 1970s.
The underlying drivers of the boom for low-cost carriers appear to be in place: rapid growth in gross domestic 
product, estimated by the International Monetary Fund at 5.8 per cent across the region for 2010, and gradual route 
liberalisation, which allows airlines to fly to more destinations.
Observers hit 'profitless growth' of airlines
"With growth in GDP per capita you are going to have a brand new population of potential passengers who may 
soon be able to fly, and that is going to create the fastest growing aviation market - and the biggest market - in the 
world," says Chad Parker, a Hong Kong-based Morgan Stanley banker.
In spite of the low-cost sector's dynamism, some analysts argue the smiles on executives' faces may be disguised 
grimaces.
Chris Tarry, a veteran UK-based aviation analyst, says the low-cost carriers can attract passengers easily as GDP 
rises, by constantly expanding to new destinations. But they face a constant threat of competition from new entrants 
who can start flying with a couple of leased aircraft.
"There is growth and there is a thing in the airline industry called profitless growth, and that is what most of them 
have," says Mr Tarry.
He says that only three low-cost airlines are probably making money on a sustainable basis - Ryanair and EasyJet 
in Europe and AirAsia, set up in 2001 by Tony Fernandes, the Malaysian entrepreneur who was one of the first to 
spot the potential of low-cost operations in Asia.
For the moment, many of the Asian no-frills carriers are declaring profits. AirAsia booked a net profit of M$130m 
(US$37m) for the quarter to September, and Cebu Pacific posted net income of 1.8bn pesos ($38m) for the first half 
of 2009. Tiger, part-owned by Singapore Airlines, says it makes money from the low-cost operation out of 
Singapore but suffered a S$50.8m (US$36m) loss for the year to March 2009 because of start-up costs in Australia.
Moreover, airline bosses themselves are divided about the way forward. Tony Davis, chief executive of Tiger, says 
the key to success remains the pure low-cost business model, with "no frills" services on single-leg flights.
"We follow the Sam Walton model," Mr Davis told a conference on the low-cost airline sector ahead of the air show, 
referring to Walmart, the US retailer. "Death, taxes and lower air fares are the only three certain things in life."
Brett Godfrey, founder and chief executive of Australia's Virgin Blue, says the sector faces an inevitable decline in 
fare yields as markets mature, which will force them to chase higher yields by competing with the full service 
carriers.
Virgin Blue has begun to chase higher yields by introducing network services, transferring passengers' bags 
between flights, and adding premium seating and refundable fares. The airline is considering introducing aircraft 
with three classes of seating.
"We made a bucketload of money and it worked very well for a long time," Mr Godfrey says. "But to succeed in the 
future low-cost will be [no more than] the price for a place at the table, no longer a guarantee of a winning hand. We 
have to take a more flexible approach."

Airlines and banks performed well on Monday, allowing European shares to bounce bank from the their biggest 
monthly loss in almost a year.
Airline stocks were higher, lifted by broker upgrades as the sector began announcing earnings and traffic data.
The Irish airline Ryanair rose 6.7 per cent to EUR3.57, after the company raised its full-year profit forecast and 
reported third-quarter losses that were less than expected. Ryanair shares reached their highest levels in more than 
four months.
Europe's biggest low-cost airline said that although market conditions remained tough, the company was still 
gaining market share from the leading European carriers Lufthansa, Air France and British Airways. Lufthansa 
added 1.3 per cent to EUR11.77 and Air France rose 1.5 per cent to EUR12.01, benefiting from a Goldman Sachs 
upgrade of the European airline sector.
Analysts at Panmure said: "Near-term market uncertainty, however, is likely to remain and it is unclear how long it 
might take for the aviation markets to recover."
Meanwhile, merger hopes also helped lift the sector, as the planned global tie-up between Iberia, BA and American 
Airlines moved closer to securing a regulatory green light in Europe. Iberia gained 2.2 per cent to EUR2.25.
Finnair rose 1.8 per cent to EUR3.90 and Ireland's Aer Lingus advanced 4.5 per cent to EUR0.69 on the back of a 
broker upgrade.
Airlines climb on the back of upgrades
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 closed 0.5 per cent higher at 1017.30, recovering from the index's biggest monthly loss 
since February 2009.
Banks extended Friday's gains. Banco Santander added 1.9 per cent to EUR10.37, Credit Suisse rose 2.9 per cent 
to SFr47.89 and Deutsche Bank gained 2.9 per cent to EUR45.65. UBS fell following concerns surrounding the 
country's economic situation and fears its US banking licence could be revoked as a result of its unresolved US tax 
dispute. However, its shares regained losses by the end of the day's trade, up 1.3 per cent at EUR14.21.
Insurance stocks performed well. Dutch ING Groep added 3.3 per cent to EUR7.09 after announcing the closure of 
three US broker-dealer units. In the wider sector, Belgian Fortis added 4.8 per cent to EUR2.68, having lost 5.5 per 
cent in the past three weeks, while Dutch Aegon advanced 2.9 per cent to EUR4.51.
Jon Peace, analyst at Nomura, said that the sector's underperformance in January was a result of renewed 
regulatory concern following the Obama proposals, fears about sovereign risk led by Greece and earnings misses 
from SocGen and BBVA. However, there was "potential for some recovery" this month.
Food producers were lower. Swiss chocolate maker Lindt & Sprungli fell 1.9 per cent to SFr258.10, while Irish Kerry 
Group lost 3.4 per cent to EUR20.70.
Meanwhile, shares in Italy's Pirelli Real Estate hit an 11-month low as the group suspended plans to merge with 
peer Fimit, in what would have created one of the country's biggest real estate groups. Pirelli shares fell 0.9 per 
cent to EUR0.45, while Fimit was steady at EUR0.28
French media group Vivendi SA lost 2.4 per cent to EUR18.39 after a US jury found the company liable for 
potentially billions of dollars in damages for misleading investors about the company's financial condition before a 
$46bn merger nearly 10 years ago.
Russian state-run energy company Gazprom reported a forecast-beating 33 per cent rise in third-quarter net profit. 
Shares in the company added 1.8 per cent to Rbs189.85.

Man Group joined a London market rally on Monday as the FTSE 100 put in its best performance in a month.
Shares in the hedge fund manager rebounded from its lowest since May after Shore Capital dismissed concerns 
that Man's benchmark AHL futures fund is broken.
AHL last year reported its first annual loss due to the effects of quantitative easing, which damped the market 
trends that the fund would usually ride, Shore said.
Investors are remaining confident that, once stimulus packages have wound down, the performance will recover, it 
added.
The broker also argued that, while new customers will be put off by AHL's losses, existing ones are likely to add to 
funds in the hope of mean reversion.
"There can be no guarantees that AHL's negative performance will end tomorrow but we do detect a belief from 
AHL that the investment environment will better suit their clean clear managed futures model in 2010 than it did in 
2009," analyst Phil Dobbin said.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience

Man shares closed higher by 3 per cent to 244¼p with the move also helped by some speculative theories.
One story doing the rounds was that Man might consider bidding for a rival UK hedge fund such as Marshall Wace.
Man joins London rally after hedge fund reassurance
After an uncertain start, the FTSE 100 followed Wall Street to close up 1.1 per cent at 5,247.41, a gain of 58.89 
points.
The rally was powered by recent underperformers such as Barclays, up 4.3 per cent to 282¼p, and Royal Bank of 
Scotland, ahead 7.9 per cent to 34¾p.
Insurers found support after the European regulator published late on Friday a feedback document that eased some 
of its previously proposed capital requirements.
Legal & General was the main beneficiary, rising 3.8 per cent to 77¾p.
Break-up speculation helped Vedanta Resources gain 5.2 per cent to £25.53 with the Indian mining group said to 
be looking at spinning off its copper and aluminium subsidiaries.
Utilities jumped after a press report revived hopes that Northumbrian Water could face a bid from its biggest 
shareholder, Ontario Teachers.
Neither group would comment and analysts were cautious of the story.
Nevertheless, traders were encouraged by a suggested 325p-a-share price- tag, which would value Northumbrian 
at about a 13 per cent premium to its regulatory asset base compared with a sector trading at about par value.
Northumbrian closed up 11.8 per cent to 289p. Severn Trent rose 4 per cent to £11.70 in tandem while United 
Utilities added 2.8 per cent to 551½p and Pennon rose 5 per cent to 540p.
Better-than-expected earnings from Ryanair helped lift British Airways, which reports on Friday, by 3.3 per cent to 
213p.
Its shares were also aided by Goldman Sachs "buy" advice. The broker argued that BA's merger with Iberia may be 
completed ahead of schedule and should come with deep job cuts on both sides.
Retail stocks found support amid gossip about potential buy-out fund interest in the sector.
Home Retail Group, one name linked to the tale, was up 2.2 per cent to 261½p.
Schroders led the blue-chip fallers, down 2.8 per cent to £12.11, after Credit Suisse downgraded to "neutral" and 
forecast a near halving of fourth-quarter fund inflows.
Among the mid-caps, Cranswick gained 2.6 per cent to 755p after the pork supplier reported better- than-expected 
sales. There was also positive trading news from SThree, the recruitment agency, which added 2.5 per cent to 
312½p.
Close Brothers was up 2.4 per cent to 709p following a press report that Nomura might bid £500m for its 
Winterflood market-making business. But Close management told investors that there had been no approach and 
people familiar with Nomura played down suggestions that the bank was interested.
Chaucer added 0.5 per cent to 46p on renewed rumours that it was a potential target for fellow Lloyds insurer Ascot 
Underwriting. Analysts cautioned that such a deal might be classed a reverse takeover.

Aer Linguson Tuesday declared itself "Ireland's civilised airline" as it unveiled a plan to position itself midway 
between Ryanair, its no-frills rival, and high-end carriers such as British Airways.
Shares in the lossmaking flag carrier initially rose as Christoph Mueller, its new chief executive, told investors in 
London of plans for a new business model that some analysts compared with that of Easyjet, Europe's second-
biggest low-cost airline.
While Aer Lingus hopes to lure business travellers with faster check-in times, pre-paid meals  and central airports, 
rather than the secondary ones for which Ryanair is known, it will not focus on the quality lounges, free food and 
drinks associated with full-service airlines.
"You could say there's a shift towards an Easyjet model," said Joe Gill of Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin, adding 
that investors seemed optimistic that the new strategy would start to deliver profits from 2011.
The airline's "civilised" tag will be seen as a dig at Ryanair, which has twice tried to buy Aer Lingusand remains its 
biggest shareholder with a stake of 29 per cent. Mr Mueller said the size of this holding remained a deterrent to 
other airlines who might wish to take a stake in Aer Lingus.
Mr Mueller, who started in the job nearly five months ago, has been trying to staunch losses suffered by the airline 
as it expanded during a recession that hit its three main markets of Ireland, the UK and the US.
He outlined a plan to achieve cost savings of EUR97m (£85m) a year by the end of 2011, in part by cutting staff 
numbers by nearly a fifth and removing several senior pilots who are among the airline's most expensive 
employees.
Aer Lingus brands itself 'civilised' airline
His presentation was an attempt to show investors how he hopes to improve revenues at the airline, which is 
expected to report a pre-tax loss of EUR108m for 2009. The airline burned through EUR400m gross cash last year 
but still has a strong balance sheet with gross cash and deposits of EUR825m, of which EUR770m is 
unencumbered.
"In a worst-case scenario, we can run for at least four and half years without running out of cash," Mr Mueller told 
the Financial Times.
However Aer Lingus said market conditions would remain "extremely challenging" this year with the first half being 
very weak, partly thanks to low bookings following bad January weather. The shares closed flat at 68 cent.

When Turkey's freshly elected AK Party government appointed new management at Turkish Airlines (THY) in 2002, 
critics muttered that the executives had been picked as much for their affinity with religious-minded politicians as for 
their commercial credentials.
The secular press sneered when Temel Kotil, chief executive, was photographed returning from the pilgrimage to 
Mecca in his slippers, and howled when Turkish Airlines staff celebrated a delivery of aircraft by sacrificing a camel.
Yet the flag carrier, still 49 per cent state-owned, has made a flying finish to a decade of rapid expansion in which it 
has become the fourth-biggest player by passenger numbers in the Association of European Airlines, increasing its 
market share from 4.19 per cent in 2005 to 7.39 per cent.
In a dismal year for the sector, passenger numbers fell 6.3 per cent across the AEA, but jumped 11 per cent year 
on year to 25.1m at THY, the company reported this week, while numbers flying business class were up 6.2 per 
cent.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley, in a recent note, predict that THY's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation margin will be "second only to Ryanair" in 2010, forecasting earnings would rise from TL657m ($452m) 
in 2008 to an estimated TL846m for 2009 despite the industry downturn.
THY's share price, which gained 4.6 per cent after the figures' release, had already trebled since mid-2009.
The company has also just placed an order with Airbus for 20 new planes from the A320 family, part of a plan to 
add 105 aircraft to the fleet by 2023.
Turkish group flies ahead of the pack
"The work of the past five to six years has started paying back," Mr Kotil said in a recent interview, citing cost cuts 
that have brought operating costs per available seat kilometre within a whisker of Ryanair's.
Membership of the Lufthansa-led Star Alliance has also saved money through joint management contracts, IT 
projects and fuel purchases.
However, the drive for economies and greater outsourcing may have caused internal friction. THY's chairman quit 
unexpectedly at the end of 2009, amid speculation of boardroom disagreements.
The strategy for future growth, though, hinges on attracting more transit passengers - numbers have increased 
more than 40 per cent in the past year - and turning Istanbul into a hub for travel from Europe to the Middle East.
"If you stay in Turkey the market is saturated . . .  If we focus only on international transit we'll see growth," Mr Kotil 
says.
THY's advantage, he explains, is that flying from Istanbul it can reach both European cities and the Gulf or North 
Africa in a two to five-hour flight for which its Boeing 737s and A320s are ideally suited.
Longer direct flights required bigger, less efficient planes, making it uneconomic for European airlines to fly direct 
from smaller cities to Gulf destinations, he argues.
Turkish Airlines is focusing on these routes, he said, rapidly adding flights at airports such as Bologna, or 
Gothenburg in Sweden, where half of passengers are for transit.

Tiger IPO shines amid the gloom
Tiger IPO shines amid the gloom

Tiger Airways, the Singapore low-cost carrier, will on Monday announce that it has raised S$248m ($178m) in the 
first initial public offering by an Asian airline for five years, defying industry gloom and investor concern about its 
forecasts.
The success of the IPO sets the stage for an increasingly intense battle between Tiger and its two main rivals - 
Malaysia's AirAsia and Jetstar, owned by Qantas - for the rapidly growing Australian and south-east Asian budget 
air travel market of 600m people.
The two airlines sought to disrupt Tiger's IPO by announcing a deal two weeks ago to cut hundreds of millions of 
dollars in annual costs through co-operation in areas such as passenger handling and aircraft maintenance.
However, a person with knowledge of the Tiger transaction said the institutional tranche of the IPO had been three-
and-a-half times subscribed, with the retail portion, which closes today four times subscribed on Friday night.
The person said strong retail interest had continued over the weekend, with the portion likely to end up eight to 10 
times subscribed.
Tiger and its bankers are understood to have set the issue price for the 165m shares on offer at S$1.50 - in the 
middle of the range of S$1.35-S$1.65 that was indicated to institutional investors.
The person with knowledge of the transaction said there was a "95 per cent chance" that demand for the shares 
would trigger an over-allotment clause, under which a further 19.8m shares would be sold by RyanAsia, controlled 
by the founding family of Ireland's Ryanair budget carrier, which held a 16 per cent stake in Tiger Airways.
Tiger IPO shines amid the gloom
The IPO will provide Tiger with S$233m before expenses to help finance the acquisition of up to 51 new Airbus 
A320 aircraft by 2015, adding to its fleet of 17 aircraft. The airline has bases in Singapore, Melbourne and Adelaide.
About S$15m of the IPO proceeds is attributable to Indigo Partners, the US-based investment company, which had 
a 24 per cent stake in the carrier.
Tiger's controlling shareholders, Singapore Airlines and Temasek, the city state's investment agency, are not selling 
any shares.
The IPO got off to a shaky start as investors queried the cost of Tiger's fleet expansion plans and its aggressive 
revenue forecasts, but bankers say Tony Davis, the airline's chief executive, was able to persuade critics that the 
forecasts were credible.
Mr Davis, an experienced airline executive, set up bmibaby, BMI's low cost carrier, in the UK.
The airline has not commented on market rumours that it was forced to reduce the IPO target before official 
marketing began, but people close to the transaction say there is "no truth" in the suggestion.
The IPO is the first Asian airline flotation since Air-Asia, headed by the flamboyant Tony Fernandes, was launched 
in Kuala Lumpur five years ago. It is the first budget airline IPO in Singapore. The Tiger offering is being managed 
by Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Singapore's DBS bank.

BAA warns of tough year ahead

Snow and fog across the UK last month dented the number of travellers passing through airports owned by BAA 
and ended a difficult year for the Spanish-owned group.
The owner of Heathrow and Stansted airports said traveller numbers in 2009 were down 4.2 per cent compared 
with 2008. "2009 was a difficult year for our airline customers," said Colin Matthews, chief executive of BAA.
"Towards the end of the year, we saw signs of improvements, particularly at Heathrow, but there are more 
challenging times ahead in 2010."
Airports across the world face additional fees of as much as EUR50,000 a week for extra security, following the 
attempted bomb attack by a Nigerian student on a Detroit-bound flight last month. BAA has still not estimated the 
costs associated with this security, beyond saying that it will have at least four full-body scanning devices in place at 
Heathrow by the end of January. At $200,000 (EUR139,000, £125,000) per device, the security machines will cost 
£500,000.
However, passenger numbers at Heathrow grew during December were boosted by greater European traffic as well 
as more long-haul flights to Asia and Africa. Increases in the number of European scheduled fights - as opposed to 
holiday resort-bound chartered flights - also helped lift passenger numbers.
In total, 8m passengers travelled through the company's airports during December, 0.9 per cent fewer than in 
December 2008. BAA estimated that the poor weather during the month prevented 150,000 people from travelling, 
reducing the number of passengers that would have gone through its airports by 1.9 per cent.
BAA warns of tough year ahead
Stansted, north east of London, also saw a relative improvement in its fortunes, with passenger numbers down 2.6 
per cent in December, the smallest drop in 22 months. Stansted has been especially hit by the reduction in 
operations there by low-cost airlines such as Ryanair.
Reduced activity by a major carrier was also partly to blame for a more severe decline in traffic at Scottish airports. 
The collapse of Edinburgh-based Flyglobespan last month combined with poor weather to depress traffic at 
Edinburgh by 4.4 per cent, while passenger numbers at Glasgow dropped 8.8 per cent. Aberdeen airport saw 
numbers fall 9.4 per cent.
Cargo tonnage improved by 20 per cent in December.
For the full year 2009, passenger numbers at Heathrow grew 1.5 per cent to 65.9m, while at Stansted, traffic fell 
10.7 per cent to 20m. At Edinburgh, traffic rose 0.6 per cent to 9m, but fell 11.3 per cent at Glasgow to 7.2m.

Third Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus 'unlikely'
Third Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus 'unlikely'

Ryanair says it is "highly unlikely" to make another bid for Ireland's struggling flag carrier, Aer Lingus, as Europe's 
largest no-frills airline confirmed on Thursday it was on track to substantially boost its EUR2.5bn ($3.6bn) cash pile 
over the next three years.
"There is no truth or basis to recent ... speculation that Ryanair is preparing a third bid for Aer Lingus," the airline 
said in a statement after briefing investors on its strategy. "In the absence of any decision by the Irish [government] 
to sell its 25 per cent stake, a third bid by Ryanair remains highly unlikely."
Ryanair, the biggest investor in Aer Lingus with a stake of 29.8 per cent, has made two failed bids for Aer Lingus 
since late 2006. The first was blocked by European regulators on competition grounds and the second, in 
December 2008, failed after the Irish government said it undervalued the airline.
Speculation has grown about a third bid because Ireland's takeover rules permit such a move from the end of 
January, and Ryanair looks set to bolster its balance sheet.
Ryanair executives confirmed to investors that after last year's failed talks with Boeing on buying up to 200 new 
jets, the airline would slash its annual capital expenditure from its current EUR1.2bn to EUR100m by the financial 
year ending March 2013.
As a result, Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said: "We expect our current cash reserves of EUR2.5bn to grow 
substantially by March 2013 and we plan to distribute surplus cash to shareholders from that date." Shares in both 
companies dipped more than 1.5 per cent in late afternoon trading on Thursday.
Third Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus 'unlikely'
Separately, Ryanair lifted a threat to cancel its Italian domestic operations from later this month after resolving a 
dispute with Italy's civil aviation authority over passenger security arrangements.
The airline had threatened to cancel all its flights in the domestic Italian market from January 23 after the regulator, 
Enac, said it would allow passengers on domestic flights to use documents other than passports or official ID cards 
when checking in and boarding.
Ryanair, which accepts only passports or European Union ID cards, said the new policy could undermine safety.
The two sides met in Rome on Thursday, after which Ryanair said the dispute had been resolved and there was no 
longer any threat to its domestic Italian services.
Meanwhile, Ryanair said it carried 4.9m passengers in December, up 12 per cent on the same month in 2008, 
meaning annual traffic grew 13 per cent to 65.3m in the 2009 calendar year.

Ryanair to meet Italians in security row

Ryanair is to meet officials from Italy's civil aviation authority on Thursday to try to resolve an escalating dispute 
over passenger security.
The Dublin-based low-cost airline is to suspend its flights in the domestic Italian market later this month after the 
regulator - the National Civil Aviation Agency, known by its Italian acronym ENAC - moved to widen the variety of 
documents passengers can present at boarding gates for domestic flights. The airline says the measure 
undermines the safety of its flights.
ENAC has accused the airline, which operates 49 routes within Italy from 10 airports, of calling into question the 
integrity of security arrangements at Italian airports and of "creating unfounded alarm and discrediting the image of 
our country in international eyes".
Italian trade unions said Ryanair engineered the row with the regulator as a way of reducing its Italian operations in 
a shrinking economy.
The dispute, which began in November but has become much more serious in the past two weeks as both sides 
hardened their stance, is taking place against the background of a raging global debate over airline security 
following a failed attempt to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas day.
Ryanair is one of the largest operators in the domestic Italian market, offering services mainly from north to south 
and from Sardinia to the mainland. Its bases are mainly in smaller cities such as Bologna and Bari. Passengers 
check in online and must present either a passport or a national ID card when boarding.
Ryanair to meet Italians in security row
ENAC wants to broaden the range of documents passengers can present, mainly in order to offer greater flexibility 
to travellers. In November, it issued an ordinance instructing airlines operating in the domestic market to accept 
valid documents other than passports or ID cards from passengers.
Ryanair said this would compromise security by allowing passengers to board using credit cards or fishing licences, 
or types of ID unfamiliar to its staff.
"Since these many other forms of ID do not meet international security standards, the only impact of ENAC's 
ordinances is to significantly reduce the safety and security of Ryanair's passengers and its flights on domestic 
Italian routes," the airline said.
Ryanair is temporarily suspending all domestic flights from its Italian bases from January 23 following ENAC's 
move. The airline said it would restore the services only "if Ryanair can be certain that the safety and security of its 
operations will not be undermined by ENAC's unlawful interference".

BA sees fresh fall in traffic numbers
BA sees fresh fall in traffic numbers

British Airways reported another poor set of monthly passenger numbers on Wednesday, as airlines began 
releasing their first traffic figures since BA cabin crew threatened a 12-day strike during the Christmas and new year 
holiday season.
But analysts said the figures for December were not as bad as might have been expected, given the extensive 
media coverage of the industrial dispute.
The number of BA passengers worldwide fell to 2.4m in December, a slide of 4.4 per cent compared with the same 
month in 2008, with the UK and Europe recording a slightly higher fall of 4.7 per cent.
This was almost as bad as the year-on-year decreases BA reported this time last year, as the airline industry was 
still struggling with the  September 2008 collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank and the global financial 
crisis.
But at that time, business class and first class traffic slumped by just over 12 per cent, while Wednesday's figures 
showed such premium traffic fell by only 0.7 per cent, with economy passenger numbers down 4.6 per cent.
The cabin crew strike threat, which was eventually averted after BA won a court order on December 17 declaring 
the union ballot behind it invalid, may have contributed to some of the fall in passenger numbers.
Cancellations led to fuller aircraft, meaning the load factor, or share of seats filled, rose slightly, though only by 0.1 
per cent.
BA sees fresh fall in traffic numbers
BA's low-cost rival, EasyJet, reported stronger figures on Wednesday, with passenger numbers rising to 3.4m for 
the month, a 9.3 per cent increase over December 2008.
EasyJet, Europe's second biggest low-cost airline after Ryanair, saw its load factor jump to more than 85 per cent in 
December, a strong figure for the month.
"BA helped at the margins," said an EasyJet spokesman. "There was a little bit of a positive effect, but not much. It 
was definitely much more to do with weather."
But analysts said the impact on revenues could be notable for EasyJet. "Whilst we imagine the BA dispute boosted 
the load factor by 1 point or so, the revenue impact will be more significant as those passengers garnered at the 
last minute will have been on abnormally high fares," said Andrew Lobbenberg of RBS.

A £5 ($8) fee imposed by Ryanair on many internet flight bookings has sparked a dispute with Britain's consumer 
protection chief, in a sign of wider concern about the extra charges levied by companies by means of "drip pricing".
Europe's leading low-cost airline delivered a typically quixotic riposte to criticisms of the charge by John Fingleton, 
Office of Fair Trading chief executive, offering customers 1m £4 "Fingleton fares" for mid-week travel.
The spat - triggered by Mr Fingleton's attack on the Ryanair booking fee as "puerile" - comes as the OFT 
investigates whether companies are unfairly adding costs during the booking process to services they offer, 
particularly online.
Ryanair announced the ticket offer - which comes with several restrictions - after Mr Fingleton was quoted in The 
Independent newspaper criticising the company for charging £5 for bookings made with cards other than the 
MasterCard pre-paid service. The airline described Mr Fingleton's remarks - he accused it of playing "silly games" - 
as "disappointing and wrong".
The company - a longstanding antagonist of the OFT - said: "Ryanair fails to understand why it was singled out for 
these inaccurate criticisms by Mr Fingleton, when its charges policies are copied by high fare UK airlines."
"Fingleton fare" tickets not bought through MasterCard pre-pay will be subject to the booking fee, increasing their 
cost by 125 per cent - offering support to the OFT's argument that "drip pricing" can lead to large differences 
between advertised costs and the amount consumers pay.
The OFT defended Mr Fingleton's remarks about Ryanair, but said it could add nothing to his statement that the 
agency "might or might not" take action against the airline.
Ryanair rebuffs fee criticism
The OFT said no investigation was under way into the company, which in 2007 was one of 13 airlines ordered by 
the agency to change websites to stop advertising flights for pennies when the true cost was many pounds.
The agency began a probe in October into price advertising, focusing on online retail. Areas it will examine include 
price-comparison sites, "baiting sales" - where only some products are available at discount - and time-limited 
offers.
The OFT has previously said travel companies' credit and debit card charges are likely to be covered by the 
investigation.

Michael O'Leary, head of low-cost airline Ryanair, is as brash and gung-ho a chief executive as you could meet. So 
when he says that the key word of 2010 will be "austerity" it gives an insight into what chief executives across 
Europe and indeed most of the western world are thinking.
"2010 is a year to be very conservative," he says. His advice to companies for this year is simple: "Hack your costs 
and try to streamline your businesses."
Management consultants, of course, would not put the matter in such a blunt manner. But the heads of two large 
consultancies believe that 2010 will offer little respite from the troubles of last year.
Alan Middleton, chief executive of PA Consulting in the UK, says: "You shouldn't let a good crisis go to waste. You 
should be looking at the fitness of your business for the future."
He says that the three priorities for companies at the moment are to ensure that they have enough liquidity, not to 
think it is business as usual and things will return to pre-crisis ways, and to make sure that no parts of the business 
are being propped up by healthier bits.
He is backed up by the head of his bigger rival, Hans-Paul Burkner of Boston Consulting Group. He says: "CEOs 
really have to rethink their business model, their positioning and the next five to 10 years very, very carefully and 
not assume that they can go back to what they experienced up to 2007.
"I think it is important to do a fundamental reassessment of how well you are positioned, how the markets in which 
you're operating are changing, how will the competitive landscape change. And to be very honest to yourself about 
your strengths, your weaknesses and to make adjustments in terms of the portfolio of your activities.
Europe's chiefs see sluggish 2010
"Now is the time to make the tough decisions", he adds.
Other chief executives are more down to earth on how they will approach the new year.
Feike Sijbesma, head of DSM, the Dutch life sciences group, says his company with EUR8bn ($11.4bn) in annual 
revenues will remain cautious for all of the year, no matter how strong the recovery.
"Cash and costs remain the priorities throughout the whole year," he says. "I want to re-evaluate that only at the 
end of the year, even if the start is good."
That means restructuring and job cuts are likely to continue across the continent. A particular focus will fall on 
Germany with about one million workers in short-time working schemes: many companies will have to decide 
whether to bring them back to full-time employment or sack them this year.
Ted Burke, chief executive of law firm Freshfields, says that lawyers will continue to be kept busy by bankruptcies 
across Europe this year. "We think we'll still see a lot of restructuring in 2010, perhaps not beyond that," he adds.
The strong euro and weak domestic demand are likely to lead to many industrial groups thinking about moving 
production out of western Europe.
Michel Demaré, chief financial officer of ABB, the Swiss electrical engineering group, says: "It is extremely 
important to keep moving our manufacturing base to emerging markets."
More than half of ABB's new orders come from emerging markets and growth there is providing succour for many 
European companies.
One area where hope springs eternal is over merger and acquisitions.
Many assumed that the crisis would see the strong buy the weak, but deals were few and far between. Outside 
advisers are now becoming optimistic again.
A study by BCG and investment bank UBS suggests that one in five large companies is planning an acquisition of 
more than EUR500m this year.
"Absent of a sudden downturn, we think we will [see deals]. We're seeing activity pick up quite a bit actually," says 
Mr Burke.
He points to rising share prices and cheaper credit as two supporting factors for M&A.
But some companies - especially smaller ones - remain worried about the possibility of a credit squeeze this year 
with business associations in Germany and Italy leading the warnings.
Chief executives are in near unison that this year will be tricky. But Mr Middleton of PA Consulting cautions them 
against changing their style, despite the tough two years previously.
"Many of us are battle weary. It's been a very tough year, 2009," he says. "As we move into 2010, strong 
leadership, strong messages from the front, are terribly important."

European equities broke their Christmas rally on Wednesday as investors booked profits following six consecutive 
sessions of gains.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged 0.4 per cent lower to 1,043.24.
After touching an all-time low in early March, the index is on track to record a gain of about 25 per cent this year, its 
best annual performance since 1999.
One of the stand-out performers in Wednesday's session was Turkish conglomerate Dogan Holding, which jumped 
9.6 per cent to TL1.03. The group said founder Aydin Dogan would leave his post as management board chairman 
next month and be replaced by Arzuhan Dogan Yalcindag, his daughter.
Dogan Yayin, the group's media arm, which has lately been embroiled in a public dispute with Turkey's government 
over a record $3.3bn tax fine, advanced 10 per cent to TL1.32 on hopes that Mr Dogan's resignation will ease 
tensions with the government.
The media group controls more than half of Turkey's print and broadcast media.
The company said the move was part of a broader restructuring plan, aimed at simplifying the management 
structure to help it "create strong foreign partnerships in investments abroad, to grow in stability and to protect and 
develop its existing economic strength".
Chairman resignation helps Dogan recover
Russia's Lukoil and Norway's Statoil both declined 1.2 per cent to Rbs1,688.06 and to NKr144.8, respectively, in 
spite of news that they had formally signed a contract with Iraqi authorities to develop Iraq's vast West Qurna 2 oil 
fields.
The untapped reserves are seen by analysts as critical to the country's reconstruction hopes.
Financials, one of the best performing sectors this year, on Wednesday weighed down the indices the most.
In Dublin, Allied Irish Banks lost 5.9 per cent to EUR1.21 and Bank of Ireland dipped 2.3 per cent to EUR1.36. UBS 
lost 1.7 per cent to SFr16.05 and Deutsche Bank declined 2.4 per cent to EUR49.42.
In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax moved 0.9 per cent lower to 5,957.43.
While it failed to defend the 6,000 mark it reached on Tuesday, it nevertheless ended its last trading session this 
year 23.9 per cent higher on the year - its best annual gain since 2007.
In Paris, the CAC 40 index lost 0.6 per cent to 3,935.50.
Ryanair dropped 3.6 per cent to EUR3.28 after the Italian civil aviation regulator said it was considering suing the 
Irish no-frills airline for libel in a dispute over check-in documents.
Ryanair said last week that it would stop domestic flights within Italy because of what it regards as reduced security 
check-in measures.
Danish wind power group Vestas rose 2.9 per cent to DKr317 after announcing two orders, one for 48 wind turbines 
for installation in Poland and another for 24 for installation in Spain.
Germany's leading cement producer HeidelbergCement moved down 0.7 per cent to EUR48.23 after it said it was 
seeking a new buyer for its operations in Israel as an agreement to sell to Mashav Initiating & Development had to 
be abandoned because of antitrust issues.
Lanxess, a leading speciality chemicals producer, dipped 1.6 per cent to EUR26.34 in spite of a positive note from 
WestLB.
The broker raised its target price to EUR31 from EUR26.
"We think it is important for investors to see now that, even in this significant downturn, the company was able to 
generate an operating profit level of around EUR400m or a margin of 8-9 per cent."

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
Snow and ice continued to cause disruption to Christmas travellers on one of the busiest days of the year for road 
travel on Thursday.
Though conditions eased in the south as temperatures began to rise, the Met Office issued warnings of 
"widespread icy roads" across eastern Scotland, the north of England and Wales.
The AA attended some 2,500 breakdowns across the UK between midnight and 9am - twice the normal volume.
Edmund King, AA president, said: "Extremely difficult travel conditions persist across many parts of the UK as 
millions of drivers, who have not yet done so, travel to family and friends for Christmas.
"Many roads today are expected to be very busy and dangerous due to snow and black ice. If drivers can 
reasonably delay any non-essential trips until Christmas Day or Boxing Day the weather and traffic should be 
better."
Some services on Southeastern trains were delayed after signalling problems in the Slade Green area of Kent.
With the exception of Heathrow Express services (which will run trains until 2pm, then replacement bus services), 
and Gatwick Express replacement bus services, there will be no national rail services running on Christmas Day.
On Boxing Day there will be limited services run by Heathrow Express, Gatwick Express, Southern, Southeastern, 
ScotRail and Stansted Express on some routes. No other services will be running.
Icy conditions hamper Christmas travel
There will be no London Underground services on Christmas Day and there will be part-closures of some lines on 
Boxing Day, with the Jubilee line completely shut on December 26, 27 and 28.
Eurostar said that it would run around two-thirds of its normal daily service between London and Paris and 
Brussels. The cross-Channel rail operator, which was hit by failures earlier in the week that had left thousands 
stranded, asked passengers with tickets for travel on Christmas Eve to arrive at St Pancras an hour before time.
Eurostar said anyone holding tickets for travel between December 19 and 23 would be able to travel on Thursday.
Conditions had eased at airports, though passengers were still suffering from some delays and cancellations. 
Easyjet was forced to cancel 16 Christmas flights across the country, while British Airways, which cancelled some 
short-haul flights on Wednesday, said its services were running normally at Heathrow.
On Wednesday a passenger jet slid off the runway after landing at a Scottish airport and two people were killed in a 
coach crash in Cornwall.
The Ryanair aircraft with 129 people on board skidded after hitting a patch of ice, coming to a halt on grass just 30 
yards from Glasgow Prestwick airport's perimeter fence and the A79 dual carriageway. No one was injured and the 
aircraft was undamaged.
Police said two people were killed and 47 others injured when a coach overturned on Tuesday evening as they 
returned from a day trip to see the Christmas lights in the Cornish fishing village of Mousehole.
..................................
Congestion in store
Shoppers flocked to supermarkets on Wednesday amid signs the bad weather had forced them to postpone buying 
food, writes Andrea Felsted.
Wednesday and Thursday were expected to be the busiest days for supermarkets. Nielsen, the market research 
group, estimates that £4bn would be spent on groceries this week.
Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, said stores were very busy and fully stocked. It will be opening its hypermarkets 
and supermarkets for an extra hour on Thursday, until 7pm.
Tesco said some online orders had to be rescheduled, but the great majority were being delivered. J Sainsbury said 
it had been working to tackle the weather conditions and its stores had been busy all week.
Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said that although the bad weather did not make things easy for the logistics 
teams of the supermarket groups, or their suppliers, he expected the bulk of products to get through to stores.
Mike Watkins, a senior manager at Nielsen, said: "Generally speaking, the supply chain is very efficient. There may 
be a couple of hours when there are a few short stocks."

A passenger jet slid off the runway after landing at a Scottish airport on Wednesday and two people were killed in a 
coach crash in Cornwall, as snow and ice continued to pose a risk to pre-Christmas travellers.
The Ryanair aircraft with 129 people on board skidded after hitting a patch of ice, coming to a halt on grass just 30 
yards from Glasgow Prestwick airport's perimeter fence and the A79 dual carriageway. Relieved passengers 
praised the pilot for managing to avert a serious accident. They were able to get off the aircraft using the normal 
exits and were taken to the terminal building by bus. No one was injured and the aircraft was undamaged.
Police said two people were killed and 47 others injured when a coach overturned on Tuesday evening as they 
returned from a day trip to see the Christmas lights in the Cornish fishing village of Mousehole.
Meanwhile Eurostar, the cross-Channel rail operator hit by failures that had left thousands stranded earlier in the 
week, said its trains running from London were all full after a three-day stoppage. It appealed to passengers not to 
join the hundreds of people queuing at St Pancras station in the hope of travelling. Eurostar said it remained 
confident that everyone wanting to travel before Christmas would be able to do so.
Flights from Luton, Gatwick, Heathrow, Glasgow and Edinburgh airports were disrupted by conditions and 
passengers were advised to check with airlines before going to theairport. Replacement bus services for trains were 
operating in Kent and Surrey.
The Met Office issued severe weather warnings in the south-west, Midlands, Wales and north of England last night. 
The predicted minimum temperatures for last night were -2ºC in the Midlands, -4ºC in northern England, -10ºC in 
Glasgow and -15ºC in rural Scotland. Scotland would have freezing fog as a result.
Jet slides off runway in freeze
Several main roads in the south were closed after rain fell on to frozen surfaces, causing accidents. Roads are set 
for more icy conditions, prompting the Met Office warn of "widespread icy roads" for most of England, Scotland and 
Northern Ireland.
Stewart Stevenson, Scottish transport minister, said conditions on the roads were the worst for 20 years.
The AA said it was receiving 1,200 breakdown calls an hour and urged motorists to delay their journeys to allow 
time for black ice to melt.
Edmund King, president of the AA, accused some councils of not acting quickly enough to grit roads and claimed 
some important roads had "not been gritted at all". The Local Government Association said the claims were 
"unverified, unsubstantiated and unjustified". But Cornwall county council confirmed that the road on which the fatal 
coach crash occurred had not been gritted because it was classed as a minor one.

Fullers warns of VAT rise to 22%

One of the UK's leading regional brewers has said that VAT will have to rise to 22 per cent as a result of the poor 
state of public finances, a prospect that would cause dismay in leisure industries.
Michael Turner, executive chairman of Fuller Smith & Turner, the brewer of London Pride ale, said the impending 
rise from 15 to 17.5 per cent would not be the last.
"I think we will have another couple of rises sadly. It is all quite worrying. I think it would have to go to 22 per cent. It 
is the only way I can see they can raise sufficient funds," Mr Turner told the Financial Times.
Many UK businesses are nervously eyeing the rise in VAT in the new year as they fear it could hit consumer 
demand. A rise to 22 per cent would be unwelcome in many industries.
However, Mr Turner said pubs would not be worse affected than other venues.
"It won't disadvantage the pub sector against anyone else. But we have had to keep up with the minimum wage and 
smoking ban. It's a lot to deal with," he added.
His comments reflect unease in the business community over how a future government - Labour or Conservative - 
will deal with the huge deficits that are a result of the financial crisis.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said 2010 would be a year for "austerity". He added that he was moving 
the focus of the low-cost airline away from the UK and Ireland towards continental Europe: "There has been 
massive government mismanagement [in the UK and Ireland]. The public finances are in a mess."
Fullers warns of VAT rise to 22%
There has been some anecdotal evidence that the impending VAT increase has led to some consumers buying 
high-priced products before Christmas.
Inchcape, the international car dealership, said recently that buyers of expensive cars had brought their purchases 
forward.
Fullers has weathered the storm in the pub industry relatively well, helped by a low amount of debt compared with 
rivals and a focus on pubs and its retail beer business.
The company, which owns more than 300 pubs across southern England, defied a "challenging period" to report an 
18 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to £14.1m ($22.4m) for the six months to September 26.

In his poem "To a Louse", Robert Burns, Scotland's bard, set out the first principle of public relations: O wad some 
Power the giftie gie us To see oursels as ithers see us! It wad frae mony a blunder free us, An' foolish notion.
There were many without the giftie in 2009, so let us review just three from the last few weeks.
First, Dubai. In late November, Dubai World, the emirate's flagship company, stunned the markets by saying it 
wanted to postpone paying its debts for six months. Could Dubai ever be trusted again? As the world fretted, Dubai 
closed down to mark the Eid al-Adha holiday.
This newspaper's role is to explain the financially incomprehensible, but we were stumped. Dubai's behaviour, we 
said, "is genuinely baffling".
A more conventional group of blunderers were British Airways' cabin crew. It is an often-told story of industrial strife. 
An abrasive management attempts to force through some change in working practices. The change seems trivial to 
outsiders, but to the employees it is the last straw.
Any workplace is filled with the buzz of who is up, who is down, who said what to whom. During times of anxiety, 
the buzz turns into a clamour, with everyone reinforcing everyone's else's sense of grievance and betrayal. The 
workers meet. They vote to strike. Sometimes their friends and neighbours sympathise. At other times, they say: 
"What on earth are you doing?"
Which is what happened to the BA cabin crew. It is not that I envy their job. It looks cramped and tiring. It cannot be 
easy being nice to people who are not always nice back. But anyone can see that BA is on the brink. It lost a record 
£401m last year. Rivals such as EasyJet and Ryanair operate at a fraction of BA's cost. BA management's decision 
Time to take off the blinkers in business class
to cut cabin crew numbers by at least one per aircraft no doubt made the job harder, but it is surely preferable to 
going out of business.
The union called the strike over the Christmas holidays, throwing 1m passengers' plans into chaos. Honeymoons 
were threatened, family reunions imperilled. Emerging from the fevered solidarity of their union meetings, the BA 
staff were stunned by the public anger.
A flight attendant, stopping to fill up on her way home from Heathrow, reported that a man had spat in her face. 
Staff were advised not to wear their uniforms in public. Last week, the high court stopped the strike in response to 
BA's claims of irregularities in the ballot. The cabin crew should now spend some time rethinking their tactics.
Bankers do not wear an easily identifiable uniform, which probably protects them from people at filling stations. But 
their feel for the public mood makes the flight attendants look like a bunch of PR smoothies.
Consider: a series of blunders by the banking industry plunged the world into the worst financial crisis since the 
1930s. Disaster was averted only by massive infusions of public money and, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, 
government guarantees of the banks. The consequence was the devastation of public finances. Children now in 
primary school will probably still be paying the bill as adults.
In the UK, Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the exchequer, announced in his pre-Budget report that public sector 
workers would face three years of real pay cuts. From 2011, everyone earning over £20,000 would pay more tax. 
The City said this was not enough. There would have to be swingeing cuts in public services once next year's 
election was out of the way.
But the City, by its own estimation, was different. It needed to pay bonuses to retain top talent. Mr Darling said he 
would prefer banks to shore up their capital. He imposed a 50 per cent tax on banks paying staff bonuses of more 
than £25,000.
The result was an eruption of fury the likes of which I have not witnessed in 25 years of reporting on British 
business, with bankers threatening to leave the UK. Tullett Prebon went so far as to offer its 700 London-based 
brokers the chance to move elsewhere.
The supertax has flaws. It hits those institutions that required direct financial support and those that did not, the 
innocent as well as the guilty. But the cuts in public services will fall with indiscriminate force too. Does the City 
think any government could survive slashing public services while the banks, held by most to have caused the crisis 
in the first place, paid out millions in bonuses?
It matters to me that the City survives and thrives, but then my job depends on it. If bankers really do leave for Zug 
or Singapore, I suspect most of Britain will ask if they would like directions to the airport.
Whoever leaves or stays, London will retain a sizeable financial community. Its leaders need to think about how 
they explain their value and worth to their fellow residents. Their recent display of petulance does them no favours.

Neil MacDonald in Belgrade
Serbia is set to benefit from the European Union's liberalisation of visa rules, which took effect on Saturday, with 
low-cost airlines lining up to add Belgrade and other airports to their routes.
Citizens of three former Yugoslav republics - Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia - can now visit most EU countries 
without standing in long queues for visas first.
Hungary's Malev and Romania's Tarom have launched services to Belgrade this month, while Italy's low-cost Wind 
Jet starts flights from Bologna to Nis, two hours' drive south of Belgrade, on December 26.
The Serbian Civil Aviation Directorate says it is in talks with five more low-cost carriers, including Ryanair, EasyJet 
and Wizz Air. And Belgrade cut airport safety taxes by 25 per cent earlier this month.
The visa relaxation marks a turning point for a generation of Serbians who are less well travelled than their parents 
were. The multi-ethnic Yugoslav federation, although communist, enjoyed good relations with the west. Citizens 
could travel around most of the world without visas. Nearby Italy was especially popular for weekend shopping trips.
Serbia has remained isolated since the 1990s wars, amid demands by the EU to catch the last few high-level war 
crimes suspects still at large.
For Vida Hadzipesic, a 40-something Serb engaged to an artist who lives in Austria, visa liberalisation brings to 
mind easier times, before war tore Yugoslavia apart. "I feel like I'm back to my youth again," she says. "My fiance 
and I will no longer have to spend a fortune just to see each other."
Serbia set to benefit from EU visa rules
She will be able to visit him more than once a month, with flights starting from as little as EUR29, she says. The 
cheapest economy fare from Belgrade to Vienna with the state-run carrier, Jat, is more than EUR100 with taxes and 
fees included.
Svetozar Krstic, secretary for tourism at the Belgrade Chamber of Commerce, says open skies will boost tourism in 
both directions. "Cheaper companies will be present, and regular companies must also become more competitive," 
he said.
The former Formula One driver Niki Lauda plans to be at the controls when Niki, his low-cost airline, flies into 
Belgrade for the first time in February. "The visa question is very important for us," he says. "This means that 
travelling will be easier for Serbian citizens."

Ryanair ponders sober maturity

Rebellious youths often mellow into conformity later in life. Does the same hold true for upstart companies?
The question was raised on Friday by the announcement from Ryanair that it was planning to scale back its rapid 
expansion in order to maximise the distribution of cash to shareholders between 2012 and 2015.
Such a move would be a big strategic shift, given that the abrasively successful Irish group has reinvested cash in 
the business instead of paying a dividend during its 12 years as a listed company.
But fast-growing companies that decide to reinvent themselves as income generators risk losing something 
valuable in the transition, says Joseph Lampel, a professor of strategy at London's Cass Business School.
He views Ryanair as a classic "breakthrough" company whose appeal is its ability to tear up the rule book, in this 
case by undermining the higher-cost business model that constrained older airlines, such as British Airways.
Shifting to a "consolidation" strategy can make innovative managers too focused on delivering stable income to 
investors, sacrificing sparkle for steadiness, says Prof Lampel.
"The financial forces push them towards conformity with other corporations," he says, adding that companies in this 
position often end up diversifying as a way of spreading risk.
He also adds that upstarts that embrace a consolidation strategy usually shut the door on their past: few are able to 
rediscover a freewheeling style should they tire of sober maturity.
Ryanair ponders sober maturity
Freek Vermeulen, an associate professor of strategic and international management at London Business School, 
agrees that it is very difficult for a company to regain its innovative edge after it has shifted focus from "exploration" 
to "exploitation".
He cites the example of Microsoft, which became much more a part of the corporate mainstream when it started 
paying dividends in 2003 but which has struggled to replicate the enormous PC-based success of Windows on the 
internet.
That said, Prof Vermeulen suggests that Ryanair's move to distributing cash would not be such an extreme step for 
the group, given that the roll-out of its low-cost network involved a fair amount of repetition as well as innovation.
In a conference call with analysts in November, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, appeared to anticipate 
fears that the company might become too focused on steady disbursements to shareholders.
He said that any cash distributions resulting from a change in strategy were likely to be one-offs rather than regular 
payments.
This approach may limit Ryanair's appeal to conventional income investors in the UK, who seek out companies that 
offer a steady stream of payments, and who have had to weather a succession of dividend cuts recently.
"We're not going to get into some kind of dividend stream," Mr O'Leary says.
"But I think you'll see very substantial one-off distributions every two or three years."
Investors will have to wait until the first quarter of 2010 for more detail on the revised strategy.

Lunch with the FT: Michael O'Leary

"Here," says Michael O'Leary, shoving something the size of a small grapefruit wrapped in red and white cardboard 
over the table in his office at Dublin airport. "Lunch."
There is an awkward silence.
You do not expect a banquet from a budget airline boss who has threatened to make his passengers pay to use the 
toilet.
And you do not want to upset a man who calls regulators "rapists", rivals "arseholes", and advises customers 
wanting a refund to "f*** off".
But what exactly has he given me here? Eventually, I make out the words on the wrapper and blurt: "Oh! A bagel!"
"It's got pesto," says O'Leary. "It was either that or McDonald's. I figured you for a bagel girl."
For himself, he has procured a grim-looking chicken salad, entombed in thick plastic, also from somewhere in the 
airport down the road. An aide arrives with two takeaway coffees. So begins lunch with one of the world's best-
known, least-loved and more improbable airline chief executives.
I had tried to persuade O'Leary's press officer that lunch in the office would be dull. Surely there was a restaurant 
he liked in Dublin? No. Lunch with the chief executive of Ryanair would be a Ryanair lunch: at the desk, just your 
basics, all expenses spared.
In the world of aviation, Ryanair is a phenomenon, a no-frills behemoth that has grown from a tiny operation which, 
in 1985, used to fly 5,000 passengers a year between Ireland and London in a single plane so small that, according 
Lunch with the FT: Michael O'Leary
to the company, its cabin crew had to be no taller than 5ft 2in. Since he took over in 1994 O'Leary has relentlessly 
expanded, with 200 aircraft flying more than 60m passengers a year to 150 European destinations, from the Canary 
Islands to Constanta in eastern Romania.
Recession has sent bigger, older airlines around the world hurtling into the red. Yet Ryanair has fared much better, 
coupling average fares of just EUR32 with a ruthless drive to cut costs and push up revenues by charging for 
everything from checking in online to buying a cup of coffee on board.
In the middle of this year Ryanair had the highest market value of any airline in the world, after Singapore Airlines. 
On the day we meet, it is getting ready to announce another quarterly profit and expects to make at least EUR200m 
this year.
None of this is evident from Ryanair's Dublin airport headquarters. Plastic sacks of wastepaper are piled at the 
entrance. Boxes are stacked up in corridors inside. The paintwork is scruffy, the carpet tired.
The open-plan office feels barely as wide as one of Ryanair's Boeing jets, and nearly as cramped. There is a single 
aisle dividing tightly packed teams of surprisingly young-looking workers into departments such as marketing, sales 
and planning.
It looks less like one of the airline industry's financial success stories and more like a scene from the television 
comedy The Office. Except the workers in The Office have bigger desks. And down at the end, peering out from 
behind the glass walls of his own modest office, is O'Leary.
Wearing jeans, open-necked checked shirt and sneakers, he looks a bit tired and pale up close. This could be 
because he and his wife Anita Farrell, a former banker, have three children under the age of eight. Or because he 
seems in a permanent state of exasperation with an endless number of irritants, including his own staff.
As I try to prise off the worryingly sturdy wrapper on the bagel, he says there are two "great things" about lunchtime 
in an out-of-the-way office like Ryanair's. "One, there's nowhere to go and eat," and two, the only time staff are 
allowed to use the internet for personal reasons is between five past one and five to two. "So they all tend to stay at 
their desks at lunch hour!"
The staff get another pasting as he moves on to talk about management consultants ("should all be euthanised") 
and MBAs ("bullshit"). "MBA students come out with, 'The customer's always right,'" he says, adopting a whiny 
voice. "Horseshit! The customer's usually wrong! And, 'My staff is my most important asset.' Bullshit! Staff is usually 
your biggest cost!"
It is hard to say how serious he is about this. Ryanair did once say it had issued a memo banning employees from 
charging their mobile phones at work to save on electricity bills. But this always sounded like another PR prank by 
O'Leary, whose flair for using the media is boundless.
Airline entrepreneurs have often revealed a talent for doing their own PR. Richard Branson flew in a hot air balloon 
for Virgin Atlantic. Stelios Haji-Ioannou wore orange jumpsuits for EasyJet. But O'Leary takes the practice to new 
heights.
It is not just his willingness to dress up as the Pope to publicise a new route to Rome. Or his (so far unrealised) 
threat to charge passengers to use the lavatory. It is the sheer savagery of his blasts that make him stand out on 
the featureless plains of modern corporate life.
For 20 bracing minutes, he runs through a list of his more egregious enemies. There are the "cretins" and "twerps" 
in the Civil Aviation Authority, the British body that regulates the "bloody evil empire" of BAA, the airport operator 
whose London monopoly was recently broken up, after prodding from O'Leary, who had griped incessantly about its 
charges.
There is the "big bloody supertanker" of Boeing, the US aircraft maker that O'Leary has been badgering for months 
to sell him 200 new jets at recessionary prices. And there is, visible right outside his office window, one of his most 
Lunch with the FT: Michael O'Leary
hated foes: Aer Lingus, the struggling Irish flag carrier for which O'Leary has made two thwarted bids in the past 
three years. "There it is," he hoots, jumping up out of his chair to point out a large squat building facing away from 
his own. "The gulag!"
He would clearly like to make a third offer for Aer Lingus, but knows this would mean trouble with its "bunch of 
bearded, sandal-wearing union bosses", not to mention Ireland's "utterly useless" politicians.
And then there is that other source of endless aggravation, Ryanair's passengers. Especially the ones wrecking his 
efforts to shave luggage-handling costs by checking in their cases (for an extra £30) because they are "too mentally 
bloody lazy to travel with carry-on bags".
Surely he doesn't seriously expect anyone to go on a three-week holiday with just a carry-on?
"Oh, for God's sake, of course you can for three weeks," he says.
"I can't."
"You can."
"I don't want to."
He stares at me, then admits his wife feels the same way.
"My wife goes away on holidays for a couple of weeks, and she wears bikinis and a few flips-flops, but she needs 
her 40 pairs of shoes," he says theatrically. "What do you need 40 pairs of shoes for?"
So, who exactly is the ideal Ryanair passenger? "Our ideal passenger is someone with a pulse and a credit card, 
who will follow the simple instructions to lower our costs to the maximum."
By this point, hunger is driving me to make a fresh attempt on the bagel wrapper. Off it comes, and there sits a sad-
looking bagel containing a pile of pesto, tomato and cucumber. I start picking at it. O'Leary's salad sits menacingly 
on his desk, untouched.
This is a typical lunch for him, he says, when he isn't at the gym.
What does he like to do in the gym?
"Look up and down a slim girl's rear," he says. "Sadly there's not that many of them. They're a bunch of old sweaty 
farts."
Though greying a little, O'Leary is, at 48, not that old. Before he became a loud-mouthed chief executive, he was a 
tax accountant, before that a businessman's son, expensively educated at some of Ireland's best schools. 
According to one newspaper's estimate he is worth more than £300m, partly thanks to a 4 per cent stake in 
Ryanair. But for years now, he has been saying he will retire "in two or three years". So what is it today?
"Three years," he says, suddenly trying to look serious. By then it will be time to "Tesco-ise Ryanair", by which he 
means time to ditch him for someone more suitable for a larger, more sedate operation.
"In certain respects I am our best salesman," he says, explaining the "pantomime villain character" he plays for the 
airline is done purely for the free publicity (the net spend on advertising last year was EUR5m, he says, not much 
for an airline Ryanair's size). "But I'm also negative in that a lot of my antics detract from the fact that Ryanair has 
the youngest fleet of aircraft, the best punctuality record, delivers a terrific customer service.
"I think you need me for the rapid growth and for the in-cost reduction initiatives, but once they're all done you then 
need to hand over to somebody who's a bit more respectful of politicians and bureaucrats, talks about caring about 
the environment and old people and f***ing jungles and fish in the sea and all that shite."
Lunch with the FT: Michael O'Leary
Goodness knows what O'Leary will do if he ever retires. He claims to have no interest in holidays. "I go to the 
Algarve with the family for two weeks, because I have to. And I can build the sandcastles with the children. You 
know, the sandcastle's fine for the first five minutes, and after that it's, 'Oh Jesus, will someone come and rescue 
me!' I'm praying for a crisis."
What about close friends? "My wife, occasionally. My children on a good day."
He hates the theatre. Only sees films when dragged by his wife, "just for marriage maintenance reasons". His main 
interests, apart from Ryanair, consist of farming, football and racehorses, of which he has a few including one called 
War of Attrition, which won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2006. I had always assumed this was an O'Leary-esque 
joke at a rival's expense - Aer Lingus, perhaps - but he says the animal had the name when he bought it.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
There is a strange lack of sophistication about O'Leary. His success has made him one of the industry's most 
prominent airline chiefs, his name constantly on the lips of his peers, his business model aped around the world. 
Willie Walsh, a fellow Irishman and the chief executive of British Airways, once told me, only half-joking, that 
O'Leary's success had even driven other airline executives to copy his dress sense: "You get these CEOs who, 
because O'Leary doesn't wear a tie or a suit, feel that to have any sort of respect, you can't wear a tie."
Yet his world view has curious gaps. At one point, I ask him what he thinks of other well-known figures in his 
industry. Stelios? "A rich kid who got off his arse." Richard Branson? "A genius in the way he has made a fortune 
out of the Virgin brand, but he doesn't add up to much." But, when asked about Tony Tyler, chief executive at 
Cathay Pacific, one of Asia's biggest airlines, he looks blank. "Never heard of him," he says. "Anyone in the airline 
industry outside of Europe, I wouldn't know who the hell they are."
There is also something rather quaint about him. He doesn't have a BlackBerry, there is no computer on his desk. 
He even claims not to have an e-mail address. "E-mail is rubbish. If there's something important, I'll send a fax, or 
we'll speak."
Each day a team compiles two reports on paper for him, one for sales, one for punctuality, which give an instant 
overview of how the business is performing. He gets up and grabs a sheet showing the day's bookings, the month's 
sales, next month's sales, available seats, how it all compares with the same month last year, and so on. "Business 
should be simple," he beams.
Lack of e-mail does not stop him being an enthusiastic correspondent. When UK advertising standards authorities 
chided him for claiming Ryanair's flights were faster than the Eurostar train, he sent them a copy of Everyday Maths 
for Dummies. Journalists who write about him sometimes get an unsolicited, though frequently charming, missive. A 
colleague on the FT who wrote a column comparing Ryanair to Aeroflot received a two-page letter along with the 
latest "Girls of Ryanair" calendar, featuring bikini-clad photos of Miss Check-In and Miss Fuel Pump, a regular 
production that O'Leary insists uses only company cabin crew.
The admiration is reciprocated, at least in the financial media. On a cabinet in a corner of his office is a dusty 
collection of awards sent by the likes of Barron's, the financial magazine that has named him one of the "world's 
most respected CEOs" ever since it started handing out the award in 2005. "Barf!" says O'Leary, looking 
embarrassed, when asked about the prizes.
His constant obsession with cost-cutting, however, not to mention his foul mouth, has also spawned less adulatory 
attention, such as the website www.ihateryanair.co.uk, dedicated to what it calls "the world's most hated airline".
Before today, I say, every person I spoke to and said I was having lunch with Michael O'Leary reacted with horror or 
pity. Doesn't he find it wearying to be such a hate figure? "It would be wearying if you weren't growing by 9m 
passengers a year," he says. "We know, fundamentally, that we have huge public support."
Lunch with the FT: Michael O'Leary
Outside, the light is fading. My flight home is getting near. My bagel is still there, still half-eaten. O'Leary's salad still 
sits on his desk.
A few days later, I get a letter from O'Leary, thanking me for taking the time to come to Dublin to see him and 
hoping I enjoyed my "five-star gourmet lunch". By the way, he adds: "I forgot to charge you for the coffee, so you 
owe me one."

If peace on earth at EasyJet still sounds implausible, goodwill between Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the airline's 
founder, and Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, is unimaginable.
They were at it again on Friday, like two pantomime rivals. A year after Sir Stelios started acting against 
entrepreneurial character by pleading publicly with EasyJet's board to be more cautious, it was Mr O'Leary's turn to 
confuse Central Casting. But is the Irishman's bravura performance as Mr Dull, the utility manager - offering surplus 
cash to shareholders - believable?
His medium-term, lower-growth soliloquy seems aimed at unsettling one part of the audience: Boeing, whose aim of 
selling 200 new airliners to Ryanair Mr O'Leary has now confounded.
The airline's short-term plans - based on a previously agreed order with the US manufacturer - still seem ambitious. 
They would push passenger numbers from 66m to 90m by 2012. But that just makes the prospect of Mr O'Leary 
taking a rest thereafter less credible. "If you'd asked me two days ago [if Ryanair would press ahead with the 
Boeing order], I'd have said O'Leary would go for broke," said one industry frequent flyer yesterday.
He may still do so. Even on the gloomiest current outlook for the world economy, it's unlikely Ryanair would get the 
same planes for less in a year or two's time. But that's the kind of bet the Ryanair boss likes to make. To stick with 
the conservative option, on the other hand, would require a shift in Mr O'Leary's personality greater than that 
undergone by Sir Stelios last year.
The EasyJet founder's attempt to turn that airline away from a growth path was only partly successful. But despite 
Sir Stelios's "I told you so" tone, Mr O'Leary looks an unlikely co-pilot on that mission. Ryanair investors hoping for 
Why O'Leary is miscast as Ryanair 's Mr Dull
a gift-wrapped dividend after 2012 will surely be disappointed - unless they can find a way to offer their voluble Irish 
boss's part to a slightly less outspoken Greek-Cypriot.
It is. Is he? Alexander Lebedev's putative putsch on The Independent and The Independent on Sunday will alarm 
the newspapers' dwindling band of readers. They may pride themselves on independent thinking, but they are not 
above stereotyping the sale as a filthy rich former Russian spy's bid to infiltrate the Great British media.
Balderdash. For one, The Independent has not been truly independent for years. It was less than a decade old 
when Independent News & Media and Mirror Group Newspapers became controlling shareholders in 1995. Indeed, 
such was the excitement about the paper back in the mid-1990s that a bidding war - with participants from Spain 
and Italy, as well as closer to home - swiftly broke out. Second, and regardless of content, The Independent and its 
Sunday sister are struggling also-rans in an industry that is at best highly competitive, at worst dying. The pair need 
someone with deep pockets capable of reversing the haemorrhaging of readers. Less than 100,000 now cough up 
the full price for The Independent in the UK and Ireland; daily sales are down 14 per cent year-on-year. It is 
reckoned to be losing approaching £10m a year.  Once they've done the arithmetic, sanctimonious readers should 
be glad they have a paper to read at all.
Finally, there is little evidence so far that Mr Lebedev would ride rough-shod over the newsroom. Nearly a year after 
buying London's Evening Standard there are few signs of tampering - a few more glacially beautiful Russian models 
and society tsarinas in the magazine pages, perhaps, but not enough to start a revolution. That could change with a 
national paper. But when Mr Lebedev bought the Standard, which he turned into a freesheet, he surmised merely 
that it would be "a good way to waste money". Clearly wasting cash is addictive - for which Independent readers 
should, on balance, be grateful.
The ability to turn £600,000 into £1m is highly prized in the City. It's worth reminding those looking for ways to 
spend their bonuses, therefore, that this alchemy is achievable without any of the stress of high-velocity trading or 
the late nights of corporate finance, simply by making a Gift Aid donation to charity (other options may be even 
more tax-efficient). These are not transactions you should boast about, but they bring their own rewards: an aura of 
righteousness more durable than any Lucite memento and, for the religiously minded, automatic promotion up the 
afterlife's league table.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, launched a caustic attack on Boeing on Friday, accusing the US aircraft 
maker of being "a bunch of idiots" and "numpties" for failing to seal an agreement to sell him 200 new 737 jets.
As a result of the ditched deal, Mr O'Leary said the no-frills Irish airline, which has long boasted it is Europe's 
fastest growing carrier, would slow its expansion and eventually start paying "a special dividend every second year" 
from a swelling cash pile.
Mr O'Leary is well-known for being outspoken but has been relatively restrained in his comments about Boeing until 
now as he tried to secure the large order of aircraft, worth $15bn at published prices.
He said a price had been agreed for the jets, due to be sent from Boeing's Seattle assembly plant between 2013 
and 2016. But the manufacturer had then insisted on a series of "Mickey Mouse" delivery conditions, which meant 
the deal failed. "Eventually you lose interest dealing with a bunch of idiots who can't make a decision," he told the 
Financial Times in an interview.
"Our share price has suffered uncertainty over the last six months [as a result of the negotiations]," he said. He 
could no longer put up with such instability because of "a bunch of numpties out in Seattle".
Shares in Ryanair jumped on the news, rising 6.45 per cent to EUR3.30.
Boeing said in a statement it was "disappointed" that Ryan­air, which is one of its biggest customers, had not 
chosen to expand its fleet.
"We worked to find a solution that met Ryanair's needs and also made good business sense for Boeing," it said.
Ryanair chief in attack on Boeing
Mr O'Leary negotiated what he has described as "rapacious" discounts on a large order of Boeing jets after the last 
aviation recession, following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, and had been keen to repeat the exercise 
in the current industry downturn.
Analysts were divided about whether Ryanair would start cutting their rate of growth significantly.
"Growth runs deep in the veins of this company," said Joe Gill of Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin. But Mr O'Leary 
insisted: "There's going to be very significant dividends by about 2012 onwards."
Others suggested Ryanair was reaching the limits of growth.
"I'm delighted that Michael O'Leary now accepts what I've been saying for over a year," said EasyJet founder Sir 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou. "The era of endless fast growth and ever larger aircraft fleet is near its end."

Portugese cement producer Cimpor led European shares higher on Friday, after the company announced it was the 
target of of a EUR3.86bn takeover bid.
Shares in Cimpor, surged 12.5 per cent to EUR6.15 after reporting Brazilian steel maker Companhia Siderurgica 
Nacional (CSN) was interested in acquiring Portugal's largest cement maker. CSN's offer represents a 5 per cent 
premium from Cimpor's closing price on Thursday.
French building group, Lafarge, which owns a 17 per cent stake in Cimpor, rose 1.1 per cent to EUR57.31.
In the wider market, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 advanced 1 per cent to 1,028.02, while the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt rose 
0.6 per cent to 5,882.24 and France's CAC 40 climbed 0.6 per cent to 3,852.78.
In Ireland, Ryanair jumped 7 per cent to EUR3.32 after the budget airline said it would concentrate on giving back 
cash to shareholders. Ryainair announced it had broken off talks with Boeing over an order of 200 new aircraft and 
would instead focus on reducing capital expenditures.
French internet provider Iliad rose 4.4 per cent to EUR83.34 after obtaining the rights to France's fourth third-
generation mobile-phone license. The regulator agreed to hand over the license after years of protest from the three 
existing operators, Bouygues Telecom, France Telecom and Vivendi's SFR.
Bouygues slipped 0.1 per cent to EUR35.37 while France Telecom was 0.1 per cent higher at EUR17.21 and 
Vivendi was up 1.4 per cent to EUR20.61.

The permanent grounding of Scotland's Flyglobespan, along with more histrionics at British Airways, has reignited 
speculation over the next airline likely to go kaput. The usual names are tossed around - Hungary's Wizz Air, 4/1 at 
Paddy Power, Finnair at 9/2. By the Irish bookmaker's reckoning - a narrow worldview, admittedly - you have to go 
a long way down the card to find the first Asian carrier: Singapore Airlines, at 100/1. That's not far off silly season 
candidates Vatican Air at 500/1 (occasional shuttles from Rome to Lourdes) and Air Force One at 1000/1.
The global industry is in a funk, brooding over an average return on equity of minus 42 per cent in the last 12 
months. But if there are pockets of exuberance, most of them are in the east. Among the largest listed airlines, the 
top 7 share-price performers this year are all Asian. By revenues, the venerable flag carriers - Lufthansa, Air 
France-KLM and Delta - still dominate. But when it comes to net income, the five biggest non-Asian airlines by 
market capitalisation are forecast to lose a combined $2.6bn in the current fiscal year. Asian's top five should earn 
$1bn.
Even so, it's a familiar hard luck story of high fuel and low yields. At the premium end, Cathay Pacific and 
Singapore Airlines are pinning hopes on a lasting business rebound.
In the middle, dependent on price-sensitive leisure travel, the likes of Malaysia Airlines and Thai Airways are 
struggling - the latter not helped by its chairman, under pressure to resign after allegedly ducking excess baggage 
fees on 500kg of luggage, carrying mostly fruit, from Japan.
And on Friday AirAsia and Jetstar, Asia's two largest budget carriers, said they were teaming up to shave costs. But 
the contrast between regions is still striking. When Ireland's Ryanair, with a five-year revenue growth rate more than 
a half better than its peers, accelerates plans to reduce capex and return cash to shareholders, you know things are 
bleak. The enfant terrible is becoming what it has always derided: a grown-up company in a low-growth industry.

Thousands stranded after airline collapse
Thousands stranded after airline collapse

Thousands of passengers booked to travel with the Edinburgh-based Globespan were stranded on Thursday as a 
result of the airline's collapse.
About 5,000 were booked to fly out of Edinburgh, while a further 3,400 people abroad who booked their holiday 
through the Flyglobespan website and are not covered by the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing scheme are 
uncertain about how they are going to get home.
Rival airlines, including EasyJet and Ryanair on Thursday began offering "rescue fares" for stranded Globespan 
passengers looking for alternative flights.
Globespan, the group that owns Scotland's biggest airline, was placed in administration on Wednesday night, with 
all scheduled flights cancelled. The company has 10 aircraft and employs 800 people, almost all of whom will be 
made redundant.
Families on the Falkland Islands will also be hard hit by Globespan's collapse. The airline had operated twice-
weekly flights for the Ministry of Defence since winning a four-year contract in 2008.  These flights are now 
grounded, sparking fears that islanders and military personnel will be unable to travel over the festive period.
The administration came after attempts to conclude a financing deal with Jersey-based Halcyon Investments broke 
down. Bruce Cartwright, joint administrator and head of business recovery services at PwC in Scotland, said: 
"Despite difficult trading conditions, the company has successfully implemented a number of steps to refine 
operations and focus on core profitable business.
Thousands stranded after airline collapse
Unfortunately, a lack of confidence in the sector following the demise of other airlines resulted in a reduction of 
liquidity to fund the ongoing operations."
This year, Globespan announced it had made an operating profit of £1.2m ($1.9m) after losing £19m the previous 
year.
The company, established in 1970, provided flights and package holidays to destinations across Europe and 
Orlando in Florida from airports in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen.
The administrators said the Civil Aviation Authority would be responsible for the repatriation of 1,100 people who 
were on holidays booked as part of Globespan packages and were covered by Atol. However, a further 3,400 
people were overseas and were not protected because they booked directly through the company's website.
There are also 27,000 people who have future flights booked through the Atol insurance scheme, and 90,000 
people who have forward bookings but have no Atol protection, though they may be protected by personal travel 
insurance or through their credit or debit card operators.
Mr Cartwright said: "Our focus right now is on assisting those passengers who need to complete return journeys 
and communicating with those who have future reservations."

Rival airlines were offering "rescue fares" for stranded Flylobespan passengers on Thursday as it emerged that 
those who had booked directly online with the airline were unlikely to be protected by the Air Travel Organisers' 
Licensing scheme.
EasyJet said people stranded in France, Switzerland, Mainland Spain, the Balearics and Portugal could get tickets 
for "a special rescue fee of £60 (including taxes)" to return to any UK airport by 24 December.
Those stranded in Cyprus, Egypt the Canaries and Madeira were offered a fare of £80 (including taxes) for return 
by the same date.
EasyJet has also offered to help passengers due to travel on routes it flies that directly overlap with Flyglobespan: 
Faro to Glasgow; Malaga to Glasgow; Alicante to Glasgow and Geneva to Edinburgh.
Fares for these routes are available for £60 (including taxes) for travel up to 30 December.
Ryanair offered a £59 - £89 (one way including taxes and charges) rescue fare for Globespan passengers for flights 
to and from Edinburgh and Glasgow (Prestwick) from a range of European destinations - subject to availability - up 
to January 15.
An airline spokesman said flights had to be booked by December 24, adding: "With over EUR2bn in cash reserves 
Ryanair is one of the most financially robust airlines in Europe" and passengers should book with it if they wanted to 
travel safely.
Rival airlines offer 'rescue fares'
Anyone checking Flyglobespan's website found it had been shut down and replaced by one page saying those who 
had booked a package holiday with the Globespan group were likely to be protected under the Air Travel 
Organisers' Licensing insurance scheme, ATOL, run by the Civil Aviation Authority. But those who had booked 
directly online with Flyglobespan were unlikely to be covered.
People paying by credit card or Visa debit card were advised to contact their card issuer to see if they could claim a 
refund.
The CAA said Globespan customers who had booked a holiday with another tour operator or travel agent not 
affected by the failure were not covered by the CAA's arrangement for Globespan's holiday customers. The 
authority advised those in this situation to contact their tour operator or agent for advice.
Globespan was the eighteenth airline to fail in Europe and North America over the last two years as the industry 
continues to suffer a downturn some believe could be as bad or worse than the one after the September 11 terrorist 
strikes in the US eight years ago.
The International Air Transport Association forecast earlier this week that the global industry losses this year will 
reach $11bn this year and $5.6bn in 2010 as airlines struggle with declining demand and relatively high fuel prices.

Administrators of Globe­span, the collapsed Scottish airline that has left thousands of passengers stranded abroad, 
were investigating last night why £30m of its funds were being held by E-Clear, the company that handles its credit 
card transactions.
Bruce Cartwright, of PwC, said he understood that about half that amount might be recoverable for creditors of the 
Edinburgh-based group, which was put into administration on Wednesday night.
Mr Cartwright declined to say whether the amount being held by E-Clear contributed to the airline's collapse, and 
said his immediate priority was getting people home. E-Clear was not available to comment.
About 1,100 passengers who were abroad on packages with the company's tour operator division are protected by 
the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing scheme, run by the Civil Aviation Authority, and will be brought home under its 
auspices.
But 3,400 passengers who had only flights with the airline will have to make their own way home, though Mr 
Cartwright said competitor companies were offering low "rescue" fares.
Ryanair, EasyJet, Virgin Atlantic, BMIbaby and Flybe were among airlines helping out with flights for holidaymakers 
stranded in Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Egypt.
The administrators made 550 Globespan employees redundant on Thursday. Brian Boyd, the Unite union's national 
officer for civil aviation, said it was tragic that Globespan had been unable to survive the current difficult trading 
conditions.
Stricken airline's £30m in spotlight
"However, the real tragedy is that, along with thousands of passengers stuck overseas, the Globespan employees 
have been thrown into a Christmas of misery with no wages and no job," he said.
An estimated 27,000 people have future flights booked with Globespan through the Atol insurance scheme, while a 
further 90,000 are thought to have forward bookings without Atol protection. Those who used credit cards should be 
able to reclaim, but those who used debit cards will probably have to rely on travel ­insurance.
Rochelle Turner, from Which? Holiday, said: "With yet another airline collapsing leaving thousands of Britons 
stranded either overseas or with future flights that they cannot take, it's really important that people take steps to 
ensure they are protected, should a similar incident occur in the future."
The collapsed airline also had a Ministry of Defence contract to operate flights in and out of the Falklands.

ING Group led European shares higher on Friday, after it appeared the Dutch bancassurer would repay the 
remainder of its state aid on better-than-expected terms.
The group announced it would repay EUR5bn in government support on December 21 and that it was in 
discussions with the Dutch state to secure more favourable repayment terms for the remaining EUR5bn in debt. 
The Dutch government confirmed it was open to a "modification of the repayment conditions" - a signal, analysts 
said, that the fees would likely be lower.
Shares in ING rose 5 per cent to EUR6.33, beating the FTSE Eurofirst 300, which advanced 0.9 per cent to 
1,013.46. France's CAC 40 climbed 0.6 per cent to 3,822.69, while in Frankfurt the Xetra Dax was up 1.1 per cent 
to 5,773.
Linde gained 2.9 per cent to EUR84.76 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the German maker of industrial gases from 
"equalweight" to "overweight"and raised its price target from EUR78 to EUR110. While the industrial gas sector has 
suffered from an absence of contracts, the brokerage predicted the trend would start reversing.
Morgan Stanley said it preferred Linde to French peer Air Liquide, as Linde had the widest emerging market 
exposure. Shares in Air Liquide were up 1.5 per cent to EUR80.61.
Ryanair climbed 2.9 per cent to EUR3.07 after Cazenove upgraded the Irish airline from "in-line" to "outperform". 
The brokerage said there was still potential for Ryanair to secure an order of 100 to 200 additional Boeing 737 
aircraft, and that new orders could help the airline achieve its capacity growth targets.
ING leads European equities higher
Elsewhere in the sector, Air France-KLM rose 0.9 per cent to EUR11.28 while Spain's Iberia added 0.9 per cent to 
EUR2.04.
In Greece the ASE general index rose 0.8 per cent to 2,231.89, after rebounding five per cent a day earlier. Most of 
the country's banks advanced after posting gains in the range of 7 per cent on Thursday.
Alpha Bank climbed 4 per cent to EUR8.32, National Bank of Greece gained 1.6 per cent to EUR18.50 and EFG 
Eurobank rose 1.2 per cent to EUR8.22, while Piraeus Bank fell 1 per cent to EUR8.73.
In the pharmaceuticals sector, Roche was 0.2 per cent higher at SFr169.20. Evolution Securities upgraded the drug 
company to "buy" with a target price of SFr190, noting that Roche had underperformed its peers by 7 per cent in the 
past three months.
Separately, Roche announced that a late phase study showed its drug, ocrelizumab, helped relieve symptoms of 
rheumatoid arthritis.

Aer Lingus chief warns of Ryanair threat
Aer Lingus chief warns of Ryanair threat

The new head of Aer Lingus has warned that the Irish airline risks being taken over by its larger rival Ryanair unless 
employees agree to his plans for sweeping cost cuts.
"If Aer Lingus isn't capable of mastering its own destiny, then of course the likelihood that some form of non-
independence might occur is more likely," Christoph Mueller told the Financial Times on Tuesday.
Asked if this meant a takeover by Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, which has made two thwarted bids for 
Aer Lingus, Mr Mueller said: "Yes."
Under Irish takeover rules, Ryanair can make a third bid from late January.
"I believe there is a correlation between our ability to have an agreement with the unions and the likelihood of a 
bid," Mr Mueller said. Ryanair holds just over 29 per cent of Aer Lingus. The Irish flag carrier's staff own 15 per cent 
of its shares.
Mr Mueller, formerly of the TUI travel group and Germany's Lufthansa, has been Aer Lingus chief executive since 
September. He has made progress with cabin crew and ground staff in talks on a EUR97m cost-saving plan 
involving job and pay cuts, but is still negotiating with pilots.
"I know that it is the desire of all our employees to stay independent and that is the reason I feel obliged to do 
everything I possibly can to reach an agreement with the unions," said Mr Mueller. "One group of employees is 
resisting and bringing Aer Lingus closer to a situation where we might lose our independence."
Aer Lingus chief warns of Ryanair threat
Aer Lingus reported a pre-tax loss of EUR119.7m for the year to December 31 and analysts say a failure to cut 
costs could jeopardise its independence.
"If there is a failure in the negotiations it leaves Aer Lingus much more vulnerable," said Joe Gill of Bloxham 
stockbrokers in Dublin.
"If talks collapse you are back to looking at a business model that is fundamentally impaired. That will be reflected 
in the share price, so it's easier for Ryanair to say they can come in and do a better job."
Ryanair first bid EUR2.80 a share for Aer Lingus in October 2006, valuing the company at EUR1.48bn. That 
takeover was blocked by the European Commission on competition grounds.
A second bid worth half that of the first in December last year also failed after the Irish government, which has a 25 
per cent stake in Aer Lingus, said it undervalued the airline.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, told the Financial Times recently Ryanair was "highly unlikely" to make 
a third offer for Aer Lingus, but added: "I think the government and unions will come here to us and ask us to help 
restructure Aer Lingus in a sensible way, probably ask us to manage it."

Aer Lingus to cut jobs as union talks fail

Aer Lingus is to extend its compulsory redundancy programme after talks with trade unions on its rescue plan broke 
down.
Despite the intervention of the Labour Relations Council, a government-run arbitration body, the company could not 
get the backing of pilots and cabin crew for its EUR97m (£87m) cost-saving plan.
Aer Lingus indicated that only temporary savings over a few years were offered by the Irish Airline Pilots 
Association, rather than the structural adjustments that management was seeking.
Christoph Mueller, chief executive, said he "wanted to prove that a unionised airline, Aer Lingus, could be turned 
around in Ireland".
He insisted that the company would prefer to achieve cost savings through agreement with its employees.
But the airline said it would now proceed to reduce fleet capacity, eliminate lossmaking routes and make 
redundancies beyond the 676 job cuts envisaged in the original plan in October.
Local newspapers suggested that the company was now looking for more than 1,000 redundancies.
The board will meet again on Friday to discuss the scale of the cuts.
Joe Gill, analyst with Bloxham stockbrokers, said the airline would sell or redeem the leases on two of its six long-
haul and five of its 33 short-haul aircraft. He said the figure of 1,000 job cuts had taken the markets by surprise. 
"But I expect the unions will kick back very hard now."
Aer Lingus to cut jobs as union talks fail
Mr Mueller said that when talks broke down on Monday the two sides had "narrowed the gap" and were "very close 
to signature".
But he made clear that IALPA had offered only "temporary savings" while "Aer Lingus was asked for very high 
compensation in return".
It is understood that the pilots, who already own 4.5 per cent of the company, sought a further 4 per cent stake in 
return for agreeing to the management restructuring plan.
Christina Carey, assistant general secretary of Impact, which represents both pilots and cabin crew, said "it would 
wrong to describe yesterday as a breakdown".
On the pilots' stake she said: "If pilots or anyone else is investing in the airline, by contributing money in terms of 
pay cuts or productivity, I think there should be recognition for that investment."
She said that cabin crew had met the savings targets set by the company, which was independently verified by 
Grant Thornton. She said cabin crew "had always delivered on their word" and had given EUR15m last year in 
"hard cash and productivity and we're prepared to contribute again".
Aer Lingus was privatised in 2006. Since then Ryanair, which has built up a 29.8 per cent stake, has launched two 
unsuccessful takeover bids. The Irish government retains a 25 per cent stake.
The shares closed up 3 per cent at 55 cents.

Growth in Europe is likely to be anaemic in the short-term but longer-term prospects for business are still healthy, 
according to some of the continent's leading chief executives.
In a series of interviews with the Financial Times, chief executives spoke of their continued belief in Europe despite 
its portrayal by some as increasingly stuck between a buoyant Asia and a still-mighty US.
"We've been through something that is not just a normal economic downturn. It is going to take a while to get back 
to where we were. It is going to be very mundane growth. But ultimately, I would be optimistic for Europe," said 
Michael O'Leary, the bluff chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair.
Peter Sands, chief executive of Standard Chartered, may be an evangelist for Asian growth - where his bank does 
most of its business - but said that Europe could not be written off: "[It is] just such a big part of the world economy."
Their comments come as Europe has moved out of its deepest recession in decades, after growth in the third 
quarter was 0.4 per cent in the eurozone.
But corporate profitability remains in the doldrums, although it is improving. Third-quarter results showed that profits 
were down 18 per cent compared with last year for eurozone companies. But compared with the previous quarter, 
they were up 11 per cent, suggesting that the worst was now over.
As the economy and profits begin to recover, chief executives are starting to return to what they see as the big 
themes for the future: the shift of economic power towards emerging markets, the future of manufacturing and the 
role of governments.
Europe's prospects seen as healthy
David Michael, the head of the globalisation practice at Boston Consulting Group, speaks for many business 
leaders when he argues that "up to 90 per cent of global growth will come from major emerging markets".
While that spells problems for Europe's economies, many of the continent's largest companies remain sanguine. 
They are targeting strong growth in these emerging countries to counter the sluggishness of their domestic markets. 
The chairman of a leading Swiss company said: "It is an exaggeration but it is almost that Europe can do badly and 
we can do well because we are in emerging markets and the US."
On the future of manufacturing on the continent, Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of French and Japanese carmakers 
Renault and Nissan, has drawn up a list of activities that will prosper in Europe, those that will die and those in 
between. What is striking is how he often makes government support the differentiating factor as to what falls in 
each list.
So, green products, heavily pushed by European governments through subsidies for technologies such as wind and 
solar power, "will play a big role", said Mr Ghosn. Low-cost products will "not have a role in Europe", he continued. 
And he meant not just western Europe: "They will go to North Africa, India and China but not eastern Europe over 
the long term".
Eastern European chief executives would rail against that idea, with Jacek Krawiec, the head of PKN-Orlen, 
Poland's largest oil company, emphasising the higher growth potential of his region compared with western Europe.
The role of governments is controversial, with questions over what happens when governments withdraw their 
support for an industry. Mr Ghosn himself notes the "adverse effect" that will come next year after the end of 
various car scrappage schemes.
And while companies seemed optimistic about the future of European business, they were less sure about Europe's 
place in the world. Mr O'Leary, asked about the rapid growth of emerging markets, said: "I don't think Europe gets 
left behind - it just gets increasingly marginalised."

Fuel costs eat into EasyJet 's profits

Higher fuel costs contributed to a halving of profits at EasyJet, although the group increased revenue per seat by 4 
percentage points.
The low-cost airline also raised its target for cost savings following the renegotiation of a large engineering contract.
Although the price of oil has fallen from a high of $147.27 in July 2008 to about $80 a barrel this month, EasyJet 
had hedged its fuel prices at higher rates than the average spot price over the year, causing an "adverse variance 
to market rates" for fuel of about £330m for the full year.
The company anticipated a tough winter but said that if fuel prices remained constant, 2010 would see a substantial 
profit improvement on this year.
EasyJet has taken steps to contain costs over the year, retiring 19 high-cost aircraft, and it announced on Tuesday 
that it had renegotiated a £1bn maintenance agreement with SR Technics to save £175m during the next 11 years.
EasyJet has now raised its target for cost savings from £125m by 2012, first identified in 2008, to £190m.
Andy Harrison, chief executive, said: "The big improvements come from additional maintenance savings, which is 
linked to the SRT contract.
"We also see substantial improvements in our airport and ground-handling costs because EasyJet has been able to 
negotiate better airport deals in a recessionary climate, where there's a number of the non-regulated airports who 
are keen to have our business," said Mr Harrison.
Fuel costs eat into EasyJet 's profits
For the year to September 30, pre-tax profit slid 50 per cent from £110.2m to £54.7m on revenue that rose 13 per 
cent from £2.36bn to £2.67bn. Earnings per share fell 14 per cent to 16.6p.
Passenger numbers increased 3.4 per cent to 45.2m, while the load factor - a measure of how many seats on a 
flight are booked - rose 1.4 percentage points to 85.5 per cent. Revenue per seat climbed by 4.1 per cent in 
constant currency, helped by a cut in the capacity of competitors and a surge in ancillary revenues - sales of 
services not directly related to the seat cost, such as baggage-checking. The shares closed down 3.7p at 388½p.
- FT Comment
EasyJet appears to have made the wrong bet on the direction of the oil price, making Ryanair's decision last year 
not to hedge look prescient. However, EasyJet has performed admirably in increasing revenue per seat by 4 per 
cent in this brutal recession for the airline industry, while Ryanair's average fares over the summer headed in the 
opposite direction: down 17 per cent. Investors seeking a bet on the recovery of air travel might plump for the 
group's shares, which trade on a forward price/earnings ratio of about 14, a discount to Ryanair's 17.

Michael O'Leary is not the typical Anglo-Irish businessman. The head of Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, says he 
is pinning his hopes on continental Europe in the coming years rather than the UK and Ireland. And, unlike Carlos 
Ghosn of Renault, it is a visceral dislike of the governments there that spurs his judgment.
With the outspoken Mr O'Leary it is sometimes hard to know whether he means something or says it because it 
furthers his fights with everybody from the UK government to Brussels. But he believes the UK and Ireland will 
broadly continue in a recession for the next year while continental Europe will enjoy a slow recovery. "There has 
been massive government mismanagement [in the UK and Ireland]. The public finances are in a mess."
His dislike of politicians even extends to rare praise from the head of an industrial company about the European 
Central Bank. "The best thing that has happened to the European economy is that rates are now set by German 
bankers and not politicians."
But this love of the Continental and dislike of the Anglo-Saxon only extends so far. He says France and Germany 
will recover quicker because they fell less far, as they were "the laggards" before the crisis, way behind the US and 
UK.
Talk of the revival of the Franco-German axis in Europe is shot down. Instead Mr O'Leary extols the virtues of the 
European Union's enlargement, bringing in countries from central and eastern Europe more in line with the US 
model.
"I am optimistic about Europe in the next five-10 years because of the accession countries and how they've 
changed the view," he says from his base in Dublin.
O'Leary looks to recovery
"The UK-eastern Europe axis is now much more dominant than the Franco-German one."
His recipe for economic growth is to "roll back the red tape". His particular worry in Europe is "that social costs are 
far too high and there is lots of overregulation". All that plays into Ryanair's quest for lower costs as well as his 
desire for a scrap.
He repeats his well-worn line of Ryanair loving the recession, before adding: "The challenge is to be nimble. Any 
eejit [idiot] can make money in a boom time. It's much harder when things are tough."

EasyJet hit by fuel hedging costs

Higher fuel costs weighed on full-year profits at Easyjet after the low-cost airline hedged a lot of its fuel needs at 
high prices.
Although the price of oil has fallen from a high of $147.27 in July 2008 to about $80 a barrel this month, Easyjet's 
locked-in hedges caused an "adverse variance to market rates" of about £330m for the full year.
The loss from the fuel hedge contrasts with Easyjet's rival Ryanair, which two weeks ago reported a near 
quadrupling of first half pre-tax profits to EUR419m, after benefiting from the lower fuel price. However, Ryanair has 
itself been caught out by fuel price oscillations: in February it reported a EUR128.7m pre-tax loss for the third 
quarter, after hedging its fuel costs above the prevailing price for the quarter.
EasyJet said that it anticipated a tough winter, but that next year would see the expiry of its fuel hedges and that if 
fuel prices remained constant, 2010 would see a "substantial" profit improvement on this year.
Easyjet on Tuesday also raised its cost savings estimate to £190m by 2012, following the renegotiation of a major 
engineering contract that will save it £175m over the next 11 years. Shares in Easyjet fell 1.6 per cent or 6.2p to 
386p in early trading.
The company has taken steps to contain costs over the year, retiring 19 high-cost aircraft and on Tuesday it 
announced it had renegotiated a £1bn maintenance agreement with SR Technics to save £175m over the next 11 
years. Easyjet has now raised its target for cost savings from £125m by 2012, first identified in 2008, to £190m.
"The big improvements come from additional maintenance savings, which is partly linked to the SRT contract we 
announced today," said Andy Harrison, chief executive of Easyjet.
EasyJet hit by fuel hedging costs
"We also see substantial improvements in our airport and ground handling costs, because very simply Easyjet has 
been able to negotiate better airport deals in a recessionary climate, where there's a number of the non-regulated 
airports who are very keen to have our business. It's those two main factors that have increased our cost savings 
target."
Mr Harrison said that he was still concerned that the recent sale of Gatwick would not necessarily improve 
competition at the airport.
"Many people think that the break up of BAA is the end of the story and everything is fixed," he said.
"That is simply not true, because it's common sense that Gatwick is a monopoly and the fact that it's got new 
owners doesn't change the fact that it's full, doesn't change the fact that it can't be expanded or that there are still 
enormously high entry barriers, which is what gives the airport this huge market power.
"So what we're concerned about is that the new owners will exploit their market power, and that's why we're 
imploring the government to tighten up UK airport regulation, and the Department for Transport are in the process 
of a review of airport regulation. We think that review is very important."
For the full-year ending in September, pre-tax profit slid by 50 per cent to £54.7m on revenues that rose 13 per cent 
to £2.67bn. Earnings per share fell 14 per cent to 16.6p.
Passenger numbers rose by 3.4 per cent to 45.2m, while the load factor - a measure of how many seats on a flight 
are booked up - rose 1.4 percentage points to 85.5 per cent. Revenues per seat climbed by 4.1 per cent in constant 
currency, helped by a reduction in the capacity of competitors, and a surge in ancillary revenues - sales of services 
not directly related to the seat cost, such as baggage-checking and insurance.
Ancillary revenues jumped 38 per cent to £9.77 per seat. Average revenues for checking a bag in the hold rose 62 
per cent in the course of the year to £4.51 per seat.
The fall-off in competition has allowed Easyjet to increase market share, increasing its number of slots at Paris, 
London Gatwick, Milan and Madrid.

Growth in Europe is likely to be anaemic in the short-term but longer-term prospects for business are still healthy, 
according to some of the continent's leading chief executives.
In a series of interviews with the Financial Times, chief executives spoke of their continued belief in Europe despite 
its portrayal by some as increasingly stuck between a buoyant Asia and a still-mighty US.

If the Japanese weren't so well mannered, my Monday evening could have been an episode of The Apprentice or 
Dragons' Den. In a tower high above Tokyo's Roppongi district, 30 branding and marketing students had gathered 
to present the fruits of a one-week assignment to their sensei (master) and his special guest (me).
The homework was far from simple: "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Japan Airlines?" The class had initially 
been divided into five groups to tackle the issue of what to do with Japan's flag carrier, and had now regrouped to 
present a common case. Takashima-sensei did the introductions and set the scene for the problems facing the 
airline - and the students.
Earlier in the day, he had told me to dispense with any niceties when the time came to critique the presentation.
"You want me to strip away the Japanese niceties, Takashima-san?" I asked.
"Yes Tyler-san," he replied. "Tell it like it is."
"Really? No holds barred?"
"Tell them as an international passenger, Tyler-san."
Takashima-san wrapped up his brief introduction and handed the microphone to the presentation team of three. 
Sitting front row, I was handed the presentation in A4 format, while at the front of the room the screen flickered to 
life.
Young dragons take to the skies
In a mixture of English and Japanese, a banker from Goldman Sachs went through an abridged history of JAL and 
the problems facing the industry as a whole. In short, the airline had an old fleet, too many bureaucrats at the helm 
and a product that didn't reflect the tastes of modern Japanese or international travellers.
While I scribbled notes on the presentation and waited for the solution, slides of Singapore Airlines, Emirates and 
Thai popped up on screen, and JAL was put into context within the global civil aviation sector - it was nowhere. The 
gentleman who seemed to be leading the group politely explained, using charts and graphs, that it didn't have a 
natural home in the contemporary aviation scene.
Then, with a lack of any dramatic build-up, he clicked to the next slide presenting their solution. I didn't quite know 
what to expect, but the proposed remedy was quite radical - turn the domestic operation into a more service-
minded, dignified low-cost carrier (this is Japan after all, so there wouldn't be much place for a Ryanair-style 
O'Leary character at the controls).
Meanwhile, he said, the long-haul part of JAL should trim its four classes (first, business, premium economy and 
economy) to just two - first class and "smart class". It was hard to gauge where the team might go with their "smart 
class" idea, but after a few minutes of cutesy illustrations and key words the proposition looked sound.
Pitched at higher-spending leisure travellers and small business owners, their catering concept called for high-
quality yet simple pre-boarding bento boxes, on-board vending machines for alcoholic drinks, free wi-fi, fully flexible 
tickets and 20 per cent more personal space. At various intervals, class members popped up wearing concept 
uniforms; a duty-free teddy bear dressed up as a flight attendant also put in an appearance, and an ad campaign 
based around the theme of gomenasai ("I'm sorry") flashed up on screen.
"JAL has to say sorry to everyone for its performance," the group leader said. "So we've created a character [a 
rhinoceros with a JAL logo on his back - go figure] named gomenasai to be the face of the new airline."
During the feedback session the class listened to our comments and, at appropriate moments, moaned in 
agreement with particularly sharp remarks. I left the seminar hoping someone might get this plan to one of the 
teams advising JAL.
The following morning, I made my way to a press conference hosted by All Nippon Airways (ANA), JAL's slightly 
smaller but more aggressive rival. Dubbed "Inspiration of Japan", ANA had chosen its flagship hotel to launch its 
new long-haul in-flight concept on the same day that JAL was delivering more bad news. Scores of cameramen and 
photographers waited outside while press officers ushered journalists inside for sneak previews. Across a back wall 
was a display that looked the biggest wedding buffet in Japan but was, in fact, ANA's new approach to catering - 
highlights included a business-class snack menu from best-selling celebrity chef Harumi Kurihara, as well as an 
expanded range of meals for economy.
"Economy passengers too will be able to buy meals from business class if they want to," explained one marketing 
executive. "They'll also be able to select whatever they want to drink and send their order straight to the galley via 
the touch screen at their seat."
With a completely new concept that should give the likes of Cathay and Lufthansa something to worry about and 
also cause JAL to despair, it was refreshing to see corporate Japan on the front foot as well as demonstrating that 
the word "civil" can still be paired with "aviation".

Stock markets on the Continent advanced for the second successive week, lifted by positive earnings reports and 
dealmaking as gross domestic product figures released on Friday showed the eurozone emerging from recession.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 climbed 2.7 per cent over the week to 1,019.41 after a 0.4 per cent gain on Friday.
In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax edged 3.6 per cent higher to 5,686.83 while the CAC 40 in Paris rose 2.7 per cent to 
3,806.01.
Iberia rose 7.5 per cent over the week, in spite of slipping back 3.2 per cent to EUR2.15 on Friday.
The Spanish airline announced a merger agreement with British Airways late on Thursday that would make it 
Europe's third-largest airline, but on Friday posted a larger than expected third-quarter loss.
Irish rival Ryanair advanced 4.6 per cent to EUR3.
Luxury goods group Richemont rose 5.6 per cent to SFr31.98 on Friday after announcing that Johann Rupert, 
executive chairman, would be taking over as chief executive next year. The company's shares were also buoyed as

Rival and unions voice opposition to BA - Iberia

Unions and rival airlines on Friday voiced opposition to the proposed British Airways- Iberia merger, although the 
deal met a cautious welcome in the City.
Virgin Atlantic argued that the deal would increase BA's dominance at London's Heathrow airport, calculating that 
the merged group would account for 44 per cent of take-off and landing slots this winter.
"It is impossible for any other airline to replicate their scale. Regulators in Europe and the US need to be alert to 
BA's growing dominance through proposals such as its monster-monopoly with American Airlines, proposals which 
will not be in the consumer interest," it said.
In a conference call with analysts, BA admitted Heathrow was full and Willie Walsh, chief executive, spoke of the 
potential of Iberia to attack the Latin American market, where BA's presence is far smaller than it is in Europe.
In a characteristically forthright statement, low-cost carrier Ryanair said it welcomed "the inevitable merger of British 
Airways and Iberia - two of Europe's high fares, fuel surcharging airlines."
"The merger of BA and Iberia is like two drunks trying to prop each other up; both have reported large losses, both 
are facing a winter of industrial action and both charge high fares and fuel surcharges," it added.
Unite, the union representing BA cabin crew, said it would not back the merger unless commitments were given to 
avoid compulsory redundancies. The two airlines expect EUR400m ($594m, £358m) in cost savings, IT, fleet 
maintenance and back office functions.
Rival and unions voice opposition to BA - Iberia
"The opportunity for these two major airlines to streamline their business will in all probability mean job insecurity for 
both BA and Iberia employees," said Brian Boyd, Unite national officer for civil aviation "Cost savings are one of the 
main drivers in the current trend for merger within the aviation industry, which is why Unite views the news of this 
merger with extreme caution."
He also said the union would seek a meeting with BA to discuss the merger. Unite last week failed in an attempt to 
get a court injunction to block BA's plans to change cabin crew work schedules from November 16, but has said it 
will press ahead with an industrial action ballot of 14,000 workers that could lead to strikes in the busy Christmas 
period.
Among analysts, Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BCG Partners and an aerospace industry specialist, said 
the main issue on the deal was not whether the cost savings were achievable, but whether a combined BA-Iberia 
could compete more effectively with rivals Air France-KLM and Germany's Lufthansa.
"It probably also signals a higher degree of confidence on the part of both carriers about underlying prospects," 
added Nick Cunningham, at Evolution Securities. "We suspect the main reason a deal could not be done previously 
was the hugely difficult and uncertain trading environment."

Japan Airlines, famous for serving Aruga Branca Clareza wine and haemorrhaging cash, has blipped on the buy-out 
radar for months. US peers American Airlines and Delta Air Lines are both fighting to partner the carrier in some 
form to build Pacific exposure, in spite of the target's precarious financial position. But now private equity firm TPG 
is in discussions about perhaps joining any deal with AA, a One World alliance partner of JAL. At a time when the 
private equity industry is reeling from bad returns, airlines would be a surprising investment.
The US airlines' strategic interest in JAL is clear. An "open skies" policy between the US and Japan should soon be 
agreed, easing access to airports for the countries' carriers on both sides of the Pacific. American Airlines in 
particular has very little exposure to the region. But they must be willing to assume some financial burden - JAL's 
loss last quarter was Y100bn and the Japanese transport ministry rates it as insolvent.
A financial sponsor, though, may be less motivated to join in. True, TPG is an experienced airline investor and has 
successfully invested in Continental and Ryanair. But two concerns should rein it back. The first is exit strategy, as 
AA wants JAL for the long haul, while TPG will not. The second may be concern from its own investors. Kohlberg 
Kravis RobertsKKR injected $400m into beleaguered filmmaker Eastman Kodak in September but that investment 
was debt; JAL requires lower-ranking equity.
Some protection may come in the form of Japanese transport minister Seiji Maehara's pledge not to allow JAL to go 
bankrupt. Promised emergency loans will ensure two major airlines continue to fly Japan's skies. Still, for private 
equity investors, the risks seem sky-high.

Japan Airlines, famous for serving weird sake and haemorrhaging cash, has blipped on the buy-out radar for 
months. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, its US rivals, are both fighting to partner in some way with JAL and 
build Pacific dominance, in spite of its precarious financial position. But now private equity firm TPG has thrown its 
hat into the ring, perhaps to partner with AA. At a time when private equity investors are reeling from bad returns, 
airlines are a surprising investment.
US airlines' strategic interest in JAL is clear. An "open skies" policy between the US and Japan may soon be 
agreed, easing access to airports for carriers on both sides of the Pacific. A stake in JAL will also build the US 
airlines' presence in Asia. For this prize, they would have to assume an immediate financial impact - JAL's loss last 
quarter was Y100bn - of investing in a company that Japan rates as insolvent.
But what is the motivation for private equity? TPG is an experienced airline investor; successful past deals include 
Continental and Ryanair. But two concerns rein back any private equity charge. The first is conceiving an exit plan. 
AA wants JAL for the long haul; TPG will not. The second is convincing investors that a stake in an ailing business 
is a good idea. KKR may have injected $400m into Eastman Kodak, the beleaguered film supplier, in September, 
but that was debt; JAL requires cash, preferably lower-ranking equity.
Some protection may come in the form of Japanese transport minister Seiji Maehara's pledge not to allow JAL to go 
bankrupt. Promised emergency loans will ensure two major airlines continue to fly Japan's skies. Still, for private

Ryanair considers scrapping no dividend policy

Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, on Monday said it might break with its tradition of rapid expansion by 
distributing cash earmarked for new Boeing planes to shareholders instead.
It raised the possibility of the strategic shift as it announced a 46 per cent rise in second-quarter profits and kept its 
full-year profit forecast steady in spite of anticipating losses in the third and fourth quarters.
The Ryanair fleet is entirely comprised of Boeing aircraft. As of September 30, it had 202 737-800 planes, with 
another 110 on order.
On Monday, it said "little progress" had been made in talks with the US aerospace group over an order for 200 
more planes for delivery between 2013 and 2016.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's famously outspoken chief executive, accused Boeing of failing to pass on savings it had 
won from suppliers and better manufacturing processes.
He said in a statement: "We won't continue these discussions indefinitely and have signalled to Boeing that if they 
are not completed before the year end, then Ryanair will end its relationship with Boeing and confirm a series of 
order deferrals and cancellations."
He added: "We would prefer to grow, but if Boeing doesn't share our vision, then I believe that Ryanair should 
change course before the end of this fiscal year and manage the airline over the next three years to maximise cash 
for distribution to shareholders."
Ryanair considers scrapping no dividend policy
Ryanair does not currently pay dividends, preferring to reinvest in the business the cash it would otherwise have 
distributed to shareholders. However, Mr O'Leary had in September floated the idea of paying a one-off dividend or 
buying back shares.
For the quarter ending September 30, Ryanair posted a EUR284.8m pre-tax profit, up from EUR195.7m for the 
same period of 2008. It said the gain was primarily due to a 42 per cent decline in fuel costs, although average 
fares were down 20 per cent. Passenger numbers increased 18 per cent.
Mr O'Leary said the winter would be a difficult one for the European airline industry. However, he remained bullish 
about Ryanair's prospects relative to those of its sector peers, even though it would make a loss in the third and 
fourth quarters, as analysts had been expecting.
Its full-year net profit forecast remained at the lower end of a EUR200m to EUR300m range.
Ryanair's London-listed shares fell 7 per cent to EUR2.75 in early morning trading on Monday, extending a run of 
autumnal weakness.

Ryanair threatens to cease growth
Ryanair threatens to cease growth

One of the first things a visitor to Ryanair's Dublin headquarters sees in the entry foyer is a framed model of one of 
the Boeing 737-800 jets that have long been the only type of aircraft in the low-cost airline's fleet.
A plaque beneath says the model was a gift from Alan Mulally, former head of Boeing's commercial airplanes 
division, to Ryanair's Michael O'Leary for the purpose of "celebrating the Boeing and Ryanair partnership" in 2002.
The problems that the aviation industry faced that year - and their consequences - help to explain why Mr O'Leary 
was busy telling everyone at Ryanair's second-quarter results presentations on Monday that he might have to rein 
in growth at his aggressively expansionist company after 2012.
In 2002, the sector was facing a recession in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Manufacturers were eager to 
sell aircraft and Mr O'Leary got what he later boasted were "rapacious" discounts on an order for 100 Boeing 737-
800s, with options for another 50.
Today, the industry is in crisis again and Mr O'Leary has been trying to exploit it by getting Boeing to sell him more 
aircraft, this time up to 200 jets.
But Boeing is showing signs of reluctance.
Mr O'Leary has, in turn, started saying he is prepared to "divorce" the US manufacturer and start talking to its 
European rivals at Airbus.
Airbus has shown a distinct disinclination to engage with Ryanair, however, and that in turn has led Mr O'Leary to 
warn that he might stop expanding Ryanair altogether.
Ryanair threatens to cease growth
"If we don't get a deal with Boeing before the end of the year we're going to cut back the growth rate between now 
and 2012, through some cancellations, some deferrals and begin to run the business from 2012 for maximised 
profits ... distribute cash out to shareholders," he said.
Seasoned Ryanair watchers say this is all simply another piece of bluster from Mr O'Leary.
It is true that his predictions can sometimes go awry: he said in 2005 he would retire by 2008 and now says he will 
go "in the next two or three years".
Some say his latest threats are borne of weakness. Paul Leighton, managing director of the UK-based Aircraft 
Value Analysis Company, which appraises aircraft values for airlines, says that despite the general aviation 
recession, market conditions for manufacturers such as Boeing are much better today than they were in 2002 
because order backlogs are so much larger. Boeing's backlog of 737 jets was 2,118 at the end of September this 
year, according to the company website, most of them for the 737-800s that Ryanair buys.
Mr Leighton points out that part of the reason for Mr O'Leary's success has been his ability to keep down 
maintenance costs with a young fleet. But that puts pressure on the airline to find replacements. "Ryanair have 
really got to think about replacing aircraft, not just growth strategy, so perhaps their position isn't as strong as they 
would like to make out," he said.
If Ryanair were to go "ex-growth", its reputation for low fares could be at risk.
By putting a stop to growth, Ryanair would be under less pressure to fill new seats, so there would be less need for 
eye-catching promotions and average fares could rise.
Analysts were divided on Monday about whether Mr O'Leary would put the strategy into practice. Bears said Mr 
O'Leary needed an excuse for the reality that the airline had reached the limits of expansion and had to stop 
growing. Bulls argued he only had 10 per cent of the European market and still had plenty of room to grow.
The latter camp pointed to the results Ryanair produced on Monday: although first-half sales fell 2 per cent to 
EUR1.77bn (£1.58bn), pre-tax profits rose from EUR105m to EUR419m, due to lower fuel costs and the absence of 
last year's EUR94m impairment charge. The results missed some of the more optimistic forecasts, but the overall 
picture is still impressive in a downturn that has left airlines strugglingaround the world.
Nevertheless, the prospect of Ryanair ending its years of high growth has excited its rivals.
"I have been telling everyone that would listen for the past year that this do-or-die mission O'Leary is on to buy 
more and more aircraft will end in tears for his shareholders," said EasyJet founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou.
"My suggestion now, as he will not find enough passengers to fill his 100 additional aircraft, is to buy a piece of the 
Mojave Desert in California and start an aviation museum for his old aircraft. It could be another ancillary revenue 
stream idea for him alongside his charging for the loo."

Shortly we shall reach our cruising altitude. That is not an announcement Ryanair investors expect to hear from 
chief executive Michael O'Leary. The low-cost airline maintained its rate of climb through the recession clouds to 
report an 80 per cent surge in September half-year earnings. But it could throttle back to a more gradual rate of 
growth.
In Mr O'Leary's latest attempt to drive a hard bargain with counterparties, he has given Boeing until the end of the 
year to cut prices on planes ordered - or he will rationalise routes and instead use the cash to pay a maiden 
dividend. He tried a similar tactic with BAA, owner of Ryanair's UK base at Stansted, earlier this year. Lower airport 
fees, he barked, or he would cut winter capacity and move planes elsewhere - something he would have done 
anyway.
Whether Boeing executives pay attention is not the point. They are only a prop in a carefully staged message to 
investors to expect slower passenger growth. If Boeing comes up trumps, so much the better. Even if it does not, 
Ryanair will keep chiselling at unit cost reductions and curb passenger volume growth from 14 per cent to about 8 
per cent over the next three years.
Although falling fuel costs helped, first half profits increased despite a 17 per cent reduction in fares. Ryanair will cut 
them a further 20 per cent in the second half to combat passenger lethargy, so full-year profit will be at the low end 
of its earlier EUR200m-EUR300m guidance. Even so, the 5 per cent fall in Ryanair's share price on Monday reflects 
investor concern over the impact of the downturn on the airline's gravity-defying profitability.
The greater fear, however, is what Ryanair's caution spells for less agile British Airways, whose shares fell by 3 per 
cent ahead of first half results on Friday. The loss-making airline's urgent need to shed costs could yet be 
undermined by a damaging cabin crew strike. Mr O'Leary's actions are aimed at boosting profitability; British 
Airways' are about basic survival.

Airlines and banks were among the worst performers on Monday, as European bourses held steady after heavy 
losses last week.
Ryanair was down 4.4 per cent to EUR2.82 after chief executive Michael O'Leary warned growth could stagnate by 
2012. While the Irish airline's adjusted net profit jumped 80 per cent in the first half, the company admitted that the 
rise was partially attributable to cheaper fuel costs, which fell 42 per cent during the same period.
Ryanair also said it could distribute cash to shareholders instead of buying new Boeing aircraft to shareholders 
instead.
In the wider sector, Air France lost 1.8 per cent to EUR10.28, Spain's Iberia fell 2.6 per cent to EUR1.83 and 
Germany's Lufthansa was down 0.6 per cent to EUR10.44.
Irish banks fell sharply after the country's finance minister said a bill to establish a "bad bank" for toxic loans could 
be further delayed. Ireland's parliament should pass the bill by Nov. 12, the minister in charge of coordinating voting 
said on Sunday, but the bill will still need the signature of President Mary McAleese and perhaps the approval of the 
Supreme Court.
Shares in Allied Irish Banks plunged 12.4 per cent to EUR1.64 while Bank of Ireland was down 3.1 per cent to 
EUR1.65.
Greek banks were also weaker after the country's central bank raised doubts about  the sector's credit risk 
provisions. While the nation's banks have recently doubled their provisions against non-performing loans, Bank of 
Airlines and banks keep bourses in check
Greece Governor George Provopoulos said the institutions remained at risk due to the downturn in Greece and 
southeast Europe, where several Greek banks have recently expanded.
The Bank of Greece fell 3.4 per cent to EUR49.30, Piraeus Bank lost 3.6 per cent to EUR11.42, Alpha Bank was 
down 3.1 per cent to EUR12.88 and the National Bank of Greece was 2.4 per cent weaker at EUR24.68.
On the overall market,  the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was flat at 975.44. In Frankfurt the Xetra Dax was .1 per cent higher 
at 5,420.56 and the CAC 40 in Paris was 0.5 per cent higher at 3,625.92.
French carmaker Peugeot gained 4.7 per cent to EUR23.3 after Faurecia, the car parts group which Peugeot owns 
a 57.4 per cent stake in, announced it would acquire US  peer Emcon Technologies. Peugeot will remain the 
majority shareholder following the acquisition, which is expected to generate about EUR60m in annual synergies.
Faurecia was 1.8 per cent higher at EUR13.45.
Linde, the German maker of industrial gases, advanced 1.3 per cent to EUR72.28 after announcing better than 
expected third quarter results. While group operating profit was down 8.8 per cent year on year, it rose 12.5 per 
cent in comparison to the second quarter.
The group's chief executive warned that Linde would not be able to match its 2008 results, but said it expected 
second half results to outperform those for the first six months.
HeidelbergCement was 1.9 per cent higher at EUR41.49. Credit Suisse initiated coverage of the the German 
cement maker with an "outperform" rating while Morgan Stanley began its coverage of the company with an 
"overweight" grade. The company's recent capital increase and attention to cash flow should allow it to meet all its 
debt maturities through 2012, Morgan Stanley said.
Atlantia, the Italian toll operator, gained 1.8 per cent to EUR16.39 after Credit Suisse reiterated the group's 
"outperform" rating and raised its target price from EUR24 to EUR25.  The bank said Atlantia  was likely to see a 
recovery in traffic volume in 2010 and 2011.

Volatility returned to the Irish banking sector on Monday on concerns that a bill to establish a "bad bank" for toxic 
loans was making slower progress in parliament than expected.
While the minister in charge of co-ordinating voting said on Sunday that he hoped parliament would be able to pass 
the bill by November 12, the bill would still need the signature of President Mary McAleese and perhaps the

Separately, Irish banks have been hit by concerns that they could face increased regulation from the European 
Union. Shares in Allied Irish Banks plunged 9.9 per cent to EUR1.69, while Bank of Ireland fell 5.9 per cent to

per cent weaker at EUR24.70.
In the wider market, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.4 per cent to 980.28 after posting heavy losses last week. In 
Frankfurt the Xetra Dax rose 0.3 per cent to 5,430.82 while the CAC 40 in Paris advanced 0.9 per cent to 3,639.46.
Irish banks tumble over toxic loans bill
In the travel sector, Ryanair was down 1.8 per cent to EUR2.90 after Michael O'Leary, chief executive, warned 
growth could stagnate by 2012. While the Irish airline's adjusted net profit jumped 80 per cent in the first half, it 
admitted that the rise was partially attributable to cheaper fuel costs, which fell 42 per cent in that period.
Ryanair also said it could distribute cash to shareholders instead of buying new Boeing aircraft.
In the wider sector, Air France lost 1.2 per cent to EUR10.33, Spain's Iberia fell 2 per cent to EUR1.84 and 
Germany's Lufthansa slipped 0.4 per cent to EUR10.46.
Commerzbank became the second German lender to pre-announce third quarter earnings, after Deutsche Bank 10 
days ago. It climbed 1.3 per cent to EUR7.19 in spite of reporting a net loss of EUR1.05bn.
Dieter Han, an analyst at Alpha Value, said the results were mostly in line with expectations. "Compared to 
Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank is not a winner of the 2009 investment banking boom. It's still loss-making," Mr Han 
said.
Commerzbank attributed the loss to its January acquisition of Dresdner Bank, which it said cost the bank 
EUR900m.
In France, carmaker Peugeot gained 4.2 per cent to EUR23.19 after Faurecia, the car parts group in which Peugeot 
owns 57.4 per cent, announced it would acquire US peer EMCON Technologies. Peugeot will remain the majority 
shareholder in Faurecia after the acquisition. Faurecia was 6.7 per cent higher at EUR14.10.
Linde, the German maker of industrial gases, advanced 2.5 per cent to EUR73.19 after announcing better than 
expected third- quarter results. While group operating profit was down 8.8 per cent year on year, it rose 12.5 per 
cent in comparison to the second quarter. Its chief executive said it expected second half results to outperform 
those for the first six months.
In Sweden tool and machinery maker Sandvik lost 2.1 per cent to EUR78.50. It posted a lower than expected third 
quarter loss on Friday.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has given the strongest indication yet that the airline may stop growing 
after 2012, when it is due to hit its target of flying 90m passengers a year.
Speaking to the Financial Times ahead of Monday's interim results, he said Ryanair did not need to secure a deal 
with Boeing for more aircraft - and could instead shift to a strategy of rationalising routes, building up cash and 
paying dividends to shareholders.
Mr O'Leary is in discussions with Boeing to order up to 200 aircraft.
Some analysts think that he may be ready to announce a deal with Boeing at Monday's results presentation.
However, others point out that recession-hit airlines around the world have been deferring aircraft deliveries - 
Lufthansa and AirAsia being the latest examples, last week.
Boeing's reluctance to finalise a deal with Ryanair for new single-aisle 737s has prompted Mr O'Leary to describe it 
as a "big bloody supertanker" that takes too long to make decisions - sending Ryanair into a "twilight zone" of 
stalled negotiations.
He has now issued Boeing with a deadline of the end of the year.
"If Boeing don't come up with the right deal for us then fine, we have divorce," Mr O'Leary said, adding that he is 
willing to start talking to Boeing's European rivals at Airbus.
But Mr O'Leary also claims that the low-cost airline may not need any new aircraft to achieve its target of 90m 
passengers in three years' time - up from this year's target of 66m.
Ryanair signals halt in growth
"If we order no more aircraft the fleet will be at 300 aircraft by 2012," Mr O'Leary added. "We may not grow at all 
after 2012."
A strategy of standing still would be good for Ryanair, he claimed. "It would allow us to weed out some of the poorer 
routes, some of the poorer aircraft bases, and switch those aircraft to new opportunities, while building up cash and 
distributing some money to shareholders."
Nevertheless, shareholders and analysts have expressed concern about the company changing from being an out-
and-out growth stock into an income stock.
Joe Gill, director of equity research at Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin, warned that shareholders would consider 
such a move premature.
"They are investors in the business as a growth model," he said.
"They hadn't built into their expectations that he would stop growing in 2012."
Ryanair has grown rapidly in the past 24 years.
Having started up as a small, lossmaking carrier with one 15-seat aircraft - which was so small that its cabin crew 
had to be less than 5ft 2in tall - it has since become one of the world's most profitable airlines.

Janine Carhart isa truly self-made woman.
Her Essex-based street furniture business Barriers Direct is on track to turnover of £2m this year, supplying 
everything from bollards to bicycle racks to businesses, home owners and local authorities across the country.
However, Carhart is the only person on the payroll because she has handed over everything she feels is not core to 
the operations - from manufacturing to finance and marketing functions - to external suppliers.
"Basically we are an outsourced company," Carhart says, noting that this flexibility allows her not only to undercut 
her rivals by at least 15 per cent, but also to enjoy  the freedom to operate from wherever she connects her laptop.
In fact, Carhart spends half of every month operating out of her second home in Sweden. "Wherever I have my 
computer, I can work," she says.
Carhart's focus on getting the maximum bang for her bucks may be influenced by her experiences before taking the 
jump into starting a business - having spent several years with the notoriously cost-concious budget airline Ryanair.
Carhart says she respects the achievements of Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, but stresses that she 
has managed to save her customer's money without the negative commentary her former boss has received.
She is not alone. A number of owners of small, but fast-growing, businesses are now opting to build operations that 
outsource all but the core value-adding service.
Some of this trend is being driven by the recession, as established companies use third parties to help shave costs.
Outsourced hands can make for a lighter workload
Glenda Stone, who chairs the government's female enterprise taskforce, claims to have slashed the overheads on 
her own recruitment marketing business - Aurora - by moving from leased premises in the City to a serviced office 
space in Canary Wharf.
"Everyone is saying, let me be as flexible as possible." she says.
Previously at Canary Wharf, a businesscould not get office space unless it took a whole floor in a building, Stone 
notes.
The recession, however, has changed the landlords' business plans and they have been willing to allow various 
companies to share the space. "It is chock full," Stone says.
Arrangements such as this mean that a business owner can save money while maintaining the flexibility to ramp up 
operations quickly when the upturn finally comes.
Ben Gladstone, whose IT support business Conosco is profiting from this small business outsourcing trend, claims 
that a lot of the interest is coming from budding entrepreneurs who are just starting up.
"There has been a shift in the way people work," he says, noting that starting a business this way enables people to 
launch a company for virtually nothing.
This was the experience of Sherie Griffiths, a former lawyer who launched Savvy Business, an online information 
portal for owner-managers, in May this year, using £10,000 of savings and a £20,000 bank loan.
"I can have access to expertise that a company like mine could never afford," she says.
All Savvy Business' telephone calls, the quarterly communication with its membership base, preparation of monthly 
accounts, the VAT returns, credit control and liaison with suppliers are handled by a third- party supplier: Paper 
Mountain Solutions.
"I do ideas," Griffiths says. "I don't do the systems, structures and other background detail which is essential to 
make those ideas fly."
Colchester-based Paper Mountain is run by Paul Smalley, who claims that he has had more inquiries from 
prospective customers in the past three months than he has had in the past three years of trading.
"There is a huge demand for our service, particularly when people are verycost-focused," Smalley says.
But being a sole director in a completely outsourced company can be a lonely state of affairs, Griffiths admits. In her 
case, being partially sighted, she does at least have the companionship of her guide dog. "I am going to get him his 
own business cards," she jokes.
She also believes that outsourcing to the extent that she has done it so far can only be a temporary arrangement 
and she plans to take matters in-house once the business has reached a certain scale.
One company that has recently pulled back from outsourcing operations is Easypack, a Suffolk-based print and 
packaging company. As part of a new business plan put together last year, the 31-year-old company decided to 
bring a fairly substantial co-packing operation that it was sub-contracting in-house.
"The contract was worth £600,000 and, although we have had to invest and take on two new buildings on10-year 
leases, we are making 50 per cent gross margin on the work," says Chris Hall, Easypack's managing director.
Hall is now looking to invest in further printing equipment over the next couple of years so that Easypack can bring 
more work in-house.
Outsourced hands can make for a lighter workload
Even Smalley at Paper Mountain admits that ambitious small and medium-sized companies can outgrow the need 
for outsourcing. His business has been operating for only five years but has already seen customers take over 
functions that Paper Mountain used to provide.
Smalley, however, sees this as a positive progression and stresses that he still maintains good relations with those 
that no longer use his services. "I realise that companies get to a certain size and find that outsourcing is just not a 
cost effective solution any more," he says.

The strikes by the Communication Workers Union are only the biggest in a series of disputes that could lead to 
industrial action in the coming months.
Most are in the communications and transport sector. This reflects the power that trade unions wield in these 
industries because of the immediate impact that strikes have on customers. Threats are currently rarer in sectors 
where strikes would cause less dramatic disruption to clients in the short term, such as manufacturing.
Cabin crew at British Airways have warned of industrial action over plans to cuts jobs and freeze pay. This could 
involve 14,000 members of the Unite union.
Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, has warned that the union "will have no hesitation in 
considering a ballot for action" unless Network Rail, which owns the UK's railway network, promises no compulsory 
redundancies to its maintenance workforce of 13,000.
The RMT is also planning a ballot of its 10,000 London Underground staff, including drivers, for "strike action and 
action short of a strike" in a dispute over pay. Unite said last week it would join the RMT in balloting its LU members 
after rejecting a pay offer - co-ordinating the timetable with its sister union.
FirstGroup, the bus and rail company, is facing strikes on Monday by several thousand drivers over a pay freeze. 
The dispute is organised by Unite.
In Leeds, 600 members of the GMB and Unison unions have been on strike since September 7 over the council's 
pay proposals for its refuse and street cleaning department. The GMB says the proposals will mean pay cuts.
Union discontent set to rise this winter
The GMB has also declared "an impasse" in talks with Swissport, the ground handling agent for Ryanair at 
Stansted airport, concerning 90 redundancies.
The union says this, combined with Swissport's plans for a change in shift patterns, could worsen customer service.
But despite the stalemate, the GMB has not yet warned of industrial action.
These disputes, when combined with the strikes by CWU postal workers, could push up the number of days lost to 
industrial action across the economy in 2009 to above last year's levels. However, even if the postal strikes 
continue, the national annual tally of days foregone this year because of stoppages is likely to remain far below the 
levels of the 1980s and earlier.
Last year, about 750,000 days were lost - an extremely small number by historical standards.

Tactics of low-cost airline

When the leaders of the low-cost airline business flew into Barcelona last month for the World Low-Cost Airlines 
Congress, the industry's annual two-day meeting, the toast of the event was Allegiant Air.
A US airline based in Las Vegas, its fees for checked baggage ($15), boarding ($5), and seat assignment (up to 
$25) might make even Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary blush. If you would like even a drink of water on an 
Allegiant flight - an average journey is two-and-a-half hours - expect to pay.
A recent analysis of 92 airlines by IdeaWorks, an airline consultancy, shows that Ryanair's take from ancillary fees 
at 19.23 per cent of income is no longer the highest - 22.7 per cent of Allegiant's income now stems from ancillary 
sales. "Whether it's on-board or online, Allegiant rarely misses an opportunity to sell," says Jay Sorenson, president 
of IdeaWorks.  "It's a well-defined business plan, consistently applied."
Such ancillary charges may enrage many passengers, but they have helped keep airlines aloft in the downturn. The 
average one-way fare on Allegiant is $87, but the airline collects almost $26 extra per passenger through in-flight 
sales.
Yet Allegiant says bookings are up by 59 per cent year-on-year and on average its flights are 85 per cent full - the 
result of a quirky, low-cost but highly profitable business model that flies from 60 mid-sized cities in the American 
hinterlands, like Fargo, North Dakota, and Wichita, Kansas, to resort destinations such as Las Vegas, Los Angeles, 
Phoenix, Fort Lauderdale and Tampa.
Allegiant co-founder and chief executive Maury Gallagher, an industry veteran who also co-founded ValuJet and 
WestAir, says: "If you live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and we're getting you out for $150 where once you had to 
pay $800, you almost want to be nice to us to make sure we don't leave."
Tactics of low-cost airline
ValuJet was the first airline to introduce ticketless travel but was absorbed by a rival after one of its aircraft crashed 
in 1996, killing all 110  passengers and crew.
"That was a really tough time," recalls Andrew Levy, Allegiant's chief financial officer. "But it led to a raft of 
airworthiness directives."
Allegiant avoids big airports so that it is not in competition with larger airlines. For small,  struggling regional 
airports, the touchdown of one of Allegiant's 43 middle-aged MD-80 aircraft is a lifeline. Boardings at Jamestown, 
North Dakota, for example, are up 48 per cent this year, says the state's airport authorities, mainly because 
Allegiant has come to town.
Allegiant agrees month-by-month leases and pays to use airport employees on a short-term contract basis, so it 
can exit quickly if the market fails to develop. For example, a service from Columbia, South Carolina to Tampa 
ended just two months after it had started.
The airline has identified another 300 routes and intends to fly to Mexico and the Caribbean. But according to Jim 
Parker, airline analyst at Raymond James, the company's reliance on small airports poses a long-term challenge for 
international expansion. "They can fly you non-stop from Fargo to Cancun no problem, but when you come back, 
there's no customs clearance in Fargo," he says. "They're going to have to stop first at a gateway airport, and that's 
a negative."
But increasingly, Mr Gallagher is describing Allegiant as a travel company that happens to own an airline. It already 
partners with other businesses such as Starwood, Alamo and Blue Man Group to bundle hotels, rental cars and 
show tickets into travel packages. About 30 per cent of the airline's customers buy these packages.
The eventual goal, he says, is to sell flights from other airlines on the Allegiant site. "Shortly, we should be 
identifiable to 100m people throughout the US," he says. "At that point, we can leverage the brand name and 
arrange all your travel."

Internet retailers and online search companies will be among those investigated in the next six months by the Office 
of Fair Trading as it conducts an inquiry into the targeting of UK internet users through advertising and pricing.
The inquiry, to be completed by spring 2010, will see the OFT examine web services offered by an array of 
companies from leading grocery groups to smaller and more specialist sites.
Privacy lobbyists said the decisionwas a sign the UK could be about to get much tougher on abuses of private 
information on the internet.
The OFT said this week it would launch an investigation into behavioural targeting, where advertisers build a profile 
of internet users based on their browsing history and use that to send them relevant ads.
It is also looking at the practice of customised pricing, where internet retailers may vary their pricing depending on 
an individual's profile and estimates of their willingness to pay.
"Behavioural advertising is rising fast, but a lot of companies don't disclose what forms of tracking are taking place," 
said Struan Robertson, technology lawyer at Pinsent Masons. "To most people it is not clear when it is happening. 
There is scope to improve disclosure on this."
The move will put companies such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, all of which track internet users' browsing and 
search preferences, under increased scrutiny.
Behavioural targeting came into focus in the UK last year when Phorm, an online advertising technology group, 
unveiled plans to monitor the internet habits of BT, TalkTalk and Virgin Media's customers. The plans were 
OFT casts a wide net for online privacy
approved by the Information Commissioner but consumer backlash eventually forced the company to put them on 
hold.
The UK has often been seen as softer on privacy protection than many of its European neighbours. It was 
noticeably absent last week from a report by the European Commission on the fines handed out by national data 
protection regulators for data loss and spam. While the Netherlands, for example, has handed out fines to websites 
using illegal monitoring technology, the UK tends to 'name and shame'.
Targeted advertising has come under increasing scrutiny by regulators globally with the US Federal Trade 
Commission, Canada's privacy commissioner and the EC all looking at how to strengthen action against online 
privacy threats.
A survey of US consumers this week showed that about two-thirds do not want marketers to tailor advertisements 
to their interests, even if the information about them is kept anonymous.
The OFT is also planning a separate market study of the way companies display prices on the internet, including 
potentially misleading practices such as "drip" pricing, where the initial cost appears low, but incremental charges 
such as postage and handling fees mount up.
The OFT took Ryanair, the low-cost airline, to task last year over unclear pricing information on its website, and 
Consumer Focus, the lobby group, has raised concerns that some price comparison sites may be failing to provide 
accurate and unbiased information.

Last week, Daniel Vasella, chief executive of Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company, hit back at animal 
rights activists who have attacked both him and his company, including the desecration of a family grave. This 
fightback has been an unusually aggressive public response by a CEO. Many prefer to keep their heads down and 
wait for protests to fade. How should business leaders engage with hostile critics: confront them, bring them inside 
for a talk or ignore them? 
THE MANAGEMENT THINKERJohn Elkington
Daniel Vasella was right to protest at this outrage. He has done more than most CEOs on societal issues, and this 
was a personal insult of a particularly unpleasant kind, at which we should all protest. 
 Few issues are as charged as animal welfare, but that doesn’t mean the agenda is unmanageable. I have been 
involved in projects that engaged parts of the animal welfare movement, with considerable progress. Multi-
stakeholder forums can boil down complex agendas to a few priorities for a company. 
 We also have involved activists who have more extreme views, though this requires sensitive handling, coupled 
with a willingness to make real changes – and a clear sense of where to draw the line. At the same time, some 
companies have made progress in reducing the numbers of animals “sacrificed”. 
 We may yet see a shift in attitudes on the treatment of animals, from toxicology labs to the US’s sprawling feed-
lots, but in the meantime companies such as Novartis know that this is one of those areas where they are almost 
always going to be on the back foot.

People’ 
When to confront hostile critics
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVEDon Elgie
This is a no-brainer – hostile critics don’t go away just because you won’t talk to them. In fact, it usually inflames the 
situation. CEOs need to engage critics – it’s even possible there is a justifiable gripe that the CEO needs to be 
made aware of. I can’t promise I’ll win a critic round but I’ll never stop trying and I’ll become better informed in the 
process. 
 “United Broke My Guitar” was set up by a passenger who failed for a year to get compensation when his guitar was 
broken on a United Airlines flight. He wrote a ditty that has had nearly 6m YouTube hits. I bet United wished it 
handled the complaint differently. 
The internet has empowered customers so, fellow CEOs, you ignore this phenomenon at your peril. (How long will it 
be before Ryanair is on the back foot with its attitude to customer complaints?)
The writer is CEO of Creston, the media group
THE ACTIVIST
Barbara Stocking
Many businesses are no longer acting on the defensive or denying criticism. Instead they have built responsible 
behaviour into the heart of their work and will be reaching out to critics to hold meaningful dialogue and promote 
mutual understanding. For both businesses and campaigning organisations, the more constructive approach is to 
resolve issues together before they become a public argument. 
 Oxfam’s principle is that if we want a business to consider our standpoint, our first approach will always be 
dialogue. This doesn’t mean campaigning won’t happen, but we will maintain conversations with a company, even if 
we are running a proactive campaign against them. Ultimately, we want to influence them to change bad practice 
into good and if we cannot persuade them through dialogue we will move to a public approach. If a discussion with 
a consumer-focused business doesn’t influence them to change policy, we will let their customers know through 
media and social networking sites; this is often a situation that most businesses would prefer to avoid.
Where we see injustice, we will campaign, but we also understand that meaningful dialogue is ultimately more likely 
to lead to positive outcomes.
The writer is chief executive of Oxfam UK
THE PRRobert Phillips
Ignoring them is not an option. Engaged conversation is the preferred route, as long as both sides are prepared to 
listen, and the antagonists stay within the law. There have to be limits to the hostility. 
 This approach runs to the heart of what we call public engagement – what will public relations look like beyond the 
digital revolution? This requires constructive dialogue and the emergence of new and responsible partnerships that 
advance shared interests among multiple stakeholders: business, governments, NGOs and, of course, citizens 
(even activist ones).
 In this new, democratised and bottom-up world, it is OK to disagree and it’s equally OK to promote a singular 
viewpoint, so long as transparency and honesty is the default position. We call this “open advocacy”.

Last week, Daniel Vasella, chief executive of Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company, hit back at animal 
rights activists who have attacked both him and his company, including the desecration of a family grave. This 
fightback has been an unusually aggressive public response by a CEO. Many prefer to keep their heads down and 
wait for protests to fade. How should business leaders engage with hostile critics: confront them, bring them inside 
for a talk or ignore them?
THE MANAGEMENT THINKERJohn ElkingtonDaniel Vasella was right to protest at this outrage. He has done more 
than most CEOs on societal issues, and this was a personal insult of a particularly unpleasant kind, at which we 
should all protest.  Few issues are as charged as animal welfare, but that doesn't mean the agenda is 
unmanageable. I have been involved in projects that engaged parts of the animal welfare movement, with 
considerable progress. Multi-stakeholder forums can boil down complex agendas to a few priorities for a company.  
We also have involved activists who have more extreme views, though this requires sensitive handling, coupled 
with a willingness to make real changes - and a clear sense of where to draw the line. At the same time, some 
companies have made progress in reducing the numbers of animals "sacrificed".  We may yet see a shift in 
attitudes on the treatment of animals, from toxicology labs to the US's sprawling feed-lots, but in the meantime 
companies such as Novartis know that this is one of those areas where they are almost always going to be on the 
back foot.The writer is a founder of SustainAbility, the consultancy, and author of 'The Power of Unreasonable 
People'
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVEDon ElgieThis is a no-brainer - hostile critics don't go away just because you won't talk to 
them. In fact, it usually inflames the situation. CEOs need to engage critics - it's even possible there is a justifiable 
gripe that the CEO needs to be made aware of. I can't promise I'll win a critic round but I'll never stop trying and I'll 
become better informed in the process. "United Airlines Broke My Guitar" was set up by a passenger who failed for 
a year to get compensation when his guitar was broken on a United Airlines flight. He wrote a ditty that has had 
nearly 6m YouTube hits. I bet United wished it handled the complaint differently. The internet has empowered

customers so, fellow CEOs, you ignore this phenomenon at your peril. (How long will it be before Ryanair is on the 
back foot with its attitude to customer complaints?)The writer is CEO of Creston, the media group
THE ACTIVISTBarbara StockingMany businesses are no longer acting on the defensive or denying criticism. 
Instead they have built responsible behaviour into the heart of their work and will be reaching out to critics to hold 
meaningful dialogue and promote mutual understanding. For both businesses and campaigning organisations, the 
more constructive approach is to resolve issues together before they become a public argument.  Oxfam's principle 
is that if we want a business to consider our standpoint, our first approach will always be dialogue. This doesn't 
mean campaigning won't happen, but we will maintain conversations with a company, even if we are running a 
proactive campaign against them. Ultimately, we want to influence them to change bad practice into good and if we 
cannot persuade them through dialogue we will move to a public approach. If a discussion with a consumer-focused 
business doesn't influence them to change policy, we will let their customers know through media and social 
networking sites; this is often a situation that most businesses would prefer to avoid.Where we see injustice, we will 
campaign, but we also understand that meaningful dialogue is ultimately more likely to lead to positive 
outcomes.The writer is chief executive of Oxfam UK
THE PRRobert PhillipsIgnoring them is not an option. Engaged conversation is the preferred route, as long as both 
sides are prepared to listen, and the antagonists stay within the law. There have to be limits to the hostility.  This 
approach runs to the heart of what we call public engagement - what will public relations look like beyond the digital 
revolution? This requires constructive dialogue and the emergence of new and responsible partnerships that 
advance shared interests among multiple stakeholders: business, governments, NGOs and, of course, citizens 
(even activist ones). In this new, democratised and bottom-up world, it is OK to disagree and it's equally OK to 
promote a singular viewpoint, so long as transparency and honesty is the default position. We call this "open 
advocacy".Our London office was recently targeted by a bunch of naked protestors from Climate Camp, angry at

Aer Lingus trade unions have reacted angrily to the airline’s plan to cut a fifth of its workforce in a €97m (£90m) 
cost-cutting programme that is aimed at saving Ireland’s former state-owned carrier.
The company, which has been hit by falling fares and higher fuel bills, is launching a two-stage “transformational 
restructuring plan” – its latest bid to return to profit.
Aer Lingus shares, which have risen 15 per cent in the past week in anticipation of the announcement, firmed 1 
cent to 73 cents.
The plan involves 676 redundancies, including 489 among pilots, cabin crew and ground staff, and 187, or 40 per 
cent, of its back-office staff. Christoph Mueller, chief executive, said: “We do not have enough work for all the 
people employed by Aer Lingus.”
Salaries for those earning above €35,000 are to be cut by 10 per cent. The company, in which the Irish government 
retains a 25.4 per cent stake, is also looking for pension cost savings and revised work practices.
Aer Lingus, which reported pre-tax losses of €119.7m in the year to December 31, said that it “cannot survive in a 
situation where staff are paid more and operate less efficiently than in comparable positions at its peers”.
The company, which has fended off two takeover bids from Ryanair since it was privatised in 2006, has embarked 
on a six-week consultation process with staff, but warned it would press on with compulsory redundancies if 
necessary.
Aer Lingus job loss plan sparks union fury
Mr Mueller, who took over last month, said the company would listen to constructive alternative proposals, but it 
“cannot compromise on the savings level”. Colm Barrington, chairman, said the plan had been unanimously agreed 
by the board, which includes David Begg, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.
But Gerry McCormack, national industrial secretary of the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, 
described the job loss proposal as “extreme and draconian and an over-reaction to the current economic climate”.
Christina Carney, assistant general secretary of Impact, which represents cabin crew, said: “We cannot keep 
propping up this airline.”

Mining stocks helped limit losses on London equities markets on Wednesday, with supermarket groups under 
pressure after  second quarter numbers from J Sainsbury narrowly missed forecasts.
The FTSE 100 gave up 0.4 per cent to 5,117.76, a fall of 20 points.
"The last 48 hours have been quite remarkable and have shown that despite the alarmingly weak economic data of 
last week, sentiment remains strong and investors are refusing to let go of the recovery grip," said Joshua 
Raymond, market strategist at City Index.
"There are almost certainly many investors who have missed out on parts of the last six months' rally and are using 
lower equity prices as buying opportunities. "
J Sainsbury shares fell 2.8 per cent to 313.9p,  reversing some of their recent gains, after the supermarket group 
reported second-quarter sales growth of 5.4 per cent,  just below analysts' expectations of 5.6 per cent.
Sainsbury's update dulled sentiment in the food retailing sector after a more optimistic statement from market 
leader Tesco on Tuesday, in which Sir Terry Leahy, chief executive, claimed the worst was over for the UK 
economy. Tesco slipped 1.9 per cent to 383p and Morrison fell 1.3 per cent to 271.6p.
"Investors will be noting that recently the grocery sector has enjoyed a boost from food inflation, which has been at 
around the 1.5 per cent  mark, however with it now standing at effectively zero, we may well see a dip in sales 
across the sector before we enter the lucrative Christmas period," pointed out Anthony Grech, market strategist, at 
IG Index.
Miners keep limit London's losses as retailers take toll
There was better sentiment on the high street away from away from supermarket groups. Analysts at UBS 
upgraded their ratinr on  Kingfisher from "neutral" to "buy", saying that margins in the noon-food sector were likely 
to improve. Shares in the owner of the B&Q home improvement chain rose 3 per cent to 222p.
InterContinental Hotels topped the FTSE 100 in morning trade, up 2.8 per cent at 821½p after analysts at Citgroup 
upgraded their rating on the the stock from "hold" to "buy", saying it had "longer term growth potential. The broker 
also said European hoteliers "still look cheap compared to US peers and little earnings upside has yet been 
factored into forecasts."
Budget airlines made progress after a note from Societe Generale drew attention to the potential for what it 
described strong earnings growth in the sector. It lifted its rating on  EasyJet and Ryanair from "hold" to "buy" and 
said it expected them to benefit from a structural shift toward short haul air traffic from longer distance routes.
It went on to downgraded British Airways from "hold" to "sell, saying:  "Our overall airline sector recommendation 
remains neutral, but we prefer low cost carriers over flag carriers".
EasyJet was 4 per cent higher at 400.4p and Ryanair held firm at EUR3.5. British Airways lost 1.2 per cent to 
220.2p,
Among mid-cap stocks, Michael Page International rose 5.4 per cent to 348p after the recruitment consultant said it 
was beginning to see signs of stability in its markets. The headhunter also said it did not plan further job cuts after 
reducing its staff by 3 per cent.
Overall, the FTSE 250, seen as more representative of the domestic UK economy, rose 35 points to 9,236.68, a 
rise of 0.4 per cent, driven by fund management stocks.
Imagination Technologies was the top performer on the mid-cap index after analysts at Panmure Gordon started 
coverage of the stock with a "buy" rating.  In a note to clients, the broker said the computer chip maker's strategic 
relationships with Apple and Intel left it well-positoned to benefit from exposure to fast-growing consumer 
electronics products. The  stock rose 7.3 per cent to 177p.

Meals on short-haul flights are gone and 1,000 cabin crew will take voluntary redundancy, some 3,000 more will 
move to part time work and unions claim salaries for new recruits may halve. All as British Airways stares down the 
barrel of its second annual loss in a row, this one perhaps £300m to £400m. Net assets of £1.6bn in March was 
around half that of a year before. Despite this, the 14,000-member BA cabin crew union has raised the spectre of 
strike action, which as the holiday season approaches will cause pre-booking nerves amongst BA's potential 
customers.
The union's response to cost cuts is puzzling, particularly given the poor productivity of Heathrow-based cabin 
crew. Crew can legally accrue up to 900 flying hours per year; a work rate that discounters Ryanair and EasyJet 
regard as normal. BA's Heathrow staff, however, only work about 600 hours a year. On transatlantic flights, a BA 
plane may fly with two more crew than rival Virgin Atlantic. Many short-haul flights only require three crew but BA 
takes four or five. This could be justified under the old full-service model but the rollback of this offering renders 
additional crew unnecessary. Furthermore, unlike those for Gatwick staff, rules for Heathrow crew make switching 
staff between short-haul and long-haul flights difficult. This lack of interoperability can leave a short-haul plane 
understaffed, while long-haul crew idle in another.
BA's crew problems are deep-rooted. The carrier may have been privatised in 1987 but indexed and longevity-
based pay rises still haunt contracts. The union has previously made an offer to BA to save about £140m but it 
should accept that the premium airline industry is listing heavily to starboard and it needs to do something more 
substantial to help.

Shares in EasyJet moved higher on Tuesday after the UK's leading low-cost airline said passenger numbers rose at 
the fastest pace in five months in September.
In another sign of the relative strength of short-haul, low-cost carriers over long-haul flag carriers in the downturn, 
EasyJet said it had just more than 4.4m passengers last month, an increase of 5.3 per cent over the same month 
last year.
The increase, the biggest since April, was well above the 4.7 per cent rise the airline recorded in August, 
traditionally one of its busiest months.
The carrier's load factor, a measurement of how well it fills its seats, also rose slightly to 88.1 per cent.
Analysts said passenger and load numbers were slightly ahead of expectations and EasyJet's shares, which rose 
more than 4 per cent during the day, closed up 1.7 per cent at 385p.
The figures came a day after Ryanair reported its September passenger numbers had risen 17 per cent compared 
with the same month last year, while its load factor increased one percentage point to 85 per cent.
In contrast, British Airways said the number of passengers it carried fell 1.7 per cent over the same period, while 
traffic measured by revenue passenger kilometres dipped 0.8 per cent.
The first and business class passengers on which BA depends heavily for revenue were down 7.9 per cent.
EasyJet said part of the reason for the increase in its passenger numbers was that it had been able to attract more 
cost-conscious business class travellers from airlines such as BA.
EasyJet passenger numbers rise
In addition, EasyJet said the airline had benefited from growing numbers of leisure travellers who had decided to 
take short-haul trips closer to home over summer rather than a longer journey from, say Europe to the US.
The airline has worked on improving its network strategy, which has seen it concentrate on main airports, putting it 
into more direct competition with larger flag carriers.
"We are now present in 40 out of the 50 largest airports in Europe," the company said.
The global aviation industry is facing what it says is the worst downturn in its history.
The International Air Transport Association, which represents the world's leading airlines, reported last month that 
the global airline industry faces $11bn of losses this year, which is $2bn more than was previously forecast.

First and business class passenger traffic, on which BA depends heavily, tumbled 7.9 per cent this September 
compared with last year, the month that saw the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US.
The number of non-premium passengers rose slightly, by 0.7 per cent, but overall passenger traffic fell 0.8 per cent.
The declines were less severe than those seen in previous months: premium traffic fell 11 per cent year-on-year in 
July, and 11.9 per cent in August.
Analysts said the figures were largely within expectations. Andrew Lobbenberg, airline analyst at Royal Bank of 
Scotland, said: “The situation is not getting worse and pressure on business travel may be moderating, though only 
slightly.”
BA reported that its passenger load factor, a measurement of how well it fills its aircraft, had risen by 2.4 points 
against September last year to 81.3 per cent, as it cut capacity.
Cargo, which has also been hit by the global downturn, fell 2.6 per cent.
Shares in BA, which were already up before the monthly passenger figures were announced, closed 6.7p higher at 
217p.
BA hit again by decline in premium traffic
In a sign of how international long-haul airlines such as BA are faring in the downturn compared with low-cost 
carriers, Ryanair reported on Monday that it carried 6.12m passengers in September, 17 per cent more than a year 
ago.
It also said its average flight was slightly fuller than last September, as its load factor increased one percentage 
point to 85 per cent.
The International Air Transport Association, which represents the world’s leading airlines, reported last month that 
the global airline industry faces $11bn (£6.9bn) of losses this year, which is $2bn more than was previously 
forecast.
The trade body also expects airlines to lose $3.8bn globally next year, as their premium business customers either 
buy cheaper tickets or stop flying altogether.

You know something strange is afoot when Michael O'Leary spends EUR500,000 of shareholders money 
campaigning for Brussels bureaucrats that Ryanair's penny-pinching chief executive usually calls "idiots". Ireland's 
second referendum on Europe's Lisbon treaty has become an emotional affair. For investors, however, the 
implications lie elsewhere.
Polls suggest a "Yes" win is likely, but not assured. It is a toss-off between anger and fear. Anger over bank 
bailouts, corruption and the depth of the recession could provoke a protest "No" targeted at an unpopular 
government; but fears that a "No" might further destabilise the economy and turn Dublin into Reykjavik-on-Liffey 
push the other way.
'No' campaigners have convinced few that Lisbon would mean lower minimum wages, legalised abortion and 
military conscription, as some of them claimed. The biggest problem for pro-Lisbon campaigners is that there is no 
simple reason for voting "Yes" that is actually based on the treaty. One trump card - that it would assure Ireland a 
permanent EU commissioner - is likely to happen regardless of Lisbon's fate. Another slogan, that "Yes" is a vote 
for recovery, is unconvincing.
After all, government bond spreads were unmoved by last June's "No". Times were different then. But a "Yes" now 
will not make it easier for Ireland to cut its budget deficit or stop the seemingly inexorable rise in government debt. 
Nor would it help boost Irish competitiveness; only a fall in wages, up 20 per cent more than the euro average since 
2000, can do that. Nor would it lift the burden of Ireland's arguably biggest economic problem - the currency, whose 
strength now stifles exports to the US and UK.
What an Irish "No" vote would do is kill the Lisbon treaty. That would mean the end of further EU enlargement; 
France and Germany have been clear about that. Iceland and Croatia might still join, but the accession of Turkey, 
Ireland's EU referendum
Ukraine, and Balkan states would be unlikely. For investors, therefore, the outcome of Friday's vote is of negligible 
importance for Ireland, but crucial for countries hundreds of miles away.

Polish airline faces unrest over cost cuts
Polish airline faces unrest over cost cuts

Cost-cutting by the new management of Poland's troubled Lot airline has prompted the unions to protest outside its 
headquarters over the axeing of a generous collective bargaining agreement.
Sebastian Mikosz, who took over Lot in March, has been trying to turn it round before a possible privatisation.
The carrier reported a loss of 733m zlotys ($262m) last year, more than half of which came from ill-timed fuel price 
hedges. In the first quarter of this year it had a loss of 310m zlotys, but in the next three months Lot made 132m 
zlotys.
Passenger numbers have been hard hit by the economic crisis. Last year, Lot carried almost 4m passengers, but in 
the first six months of this year it carried only 1.7m.
"Lot's situation is no different from what is happening in the wider market, which is undergoing the biggest crisis 
since the second world war," Mr Mikosz said. But unlike larger carriers, Lot may not have the resources to ride out 
the crisis on its own.
Since taking over the airline, which is 93 per cent owned by the state treasury, Mr Mikosz has shut Lot's lossmaking 
low-cost subsidiary, Central Wings, slashed revenue-losing routes, and revoked a collective bargaining agreement 
which gave unionised workers generous protections and compensation.
"I have to restructure the airline at the cost of employment," said Mr Mikosz. "We are trying to rescue the jobs of the 
people who are left."
Polish airline faces unrest over cost cuts
The cuts, including firing two union leaders, are causing labour unrest. The treasury ministry plans to meet 
management and unions next week to see if the two sides can be reconciled.
Simply cutting costs is not enough. Mr Mikosz, the seventh chief executive to lead the airline in the past four years, 
also has to decide whether an airline the size of Lot has a future as an independent carrier, or will have to be 
incorporated into a larger alliance.
Lufthansa, Lot's partner in the 24-member Star alliance, has long been seen as the likeliest candidate to take over 
the Polish airline. However, Lufthansa is in the process of acquiring Austrian and BMI British Midland.
Although Lot is Poland's leading airline, it is being harried by low-cost carriers, such as Ryanair, which has declared 
it wants to be Poland's largest airline by 2011.
Lot does fly some long-distance point-to-point routes to North America, but much of its flights consist of shuttling 
Polish passengers to Lufthansa's hubs in Frankfurt and Munich.
The airline has chosen Morgan Stanley to act as its adviser on the privatisation.

Ireland 's Yes camp makes final appeal

Irish politicians and businessmen appealed on Wednesday for a decisive Yes vote in Friday's referendum on the 
European Union's Lisbon treaty to speed the nation's economic recovery and return it to the heart of Europe.
"Only with a Yes will we ensure investor confidence in Ireland, protect our influence in vital economic decisions and 
reform Europe so that it is more dynamic and effective," Brian Cowen, the prime minister, said.
Opinion polls predict a comfortable victory for the pro-Lisbon camp, which includes the centre-right Fianna Fáil-led 
government, all opposition parties except the nationalist Sinn Féin and the Socialist party, and dozens of big Irish 
companies, business associations and foreign investors.
A Yes vote would reverse the outcome of a June 2008 Irish referendum against the treaty, which redesigns the 
EU's voting procedures, enhances the European parliament's powers and envisages the appointment of the bloc's 
first full-time president and a strengthened head of foreign policy.
Pro-Lisbon forces in Ireland are worried that the No camp may benefit from the deep unpopularity of Mr Cowen's 
government, held responsible for the near-collapse of Ireland's banking system and a savage recession that has 
pushed unemployment up to 12.6 per cent of the workforce.
Up to 5,000 trade unionists and community activists staged a demonstration in Dublin on Wednesday over the 
government's alleged plans to cut public services.
Jim O'Hara, who runs the Irish operations of Intel, the US chip maker that is the largest foreign investor in Ireland, 
and who is one of the Yes camp's most prominent campaigners, told the Financial Times: "It's quite volatile. There's 
a lot of anger at the government."
Ireland 's Yes camp makes final appeal
He added: "A Yes vote is no guarantee of extra jobs, but we will have much better prospects of an increase in our 
economic prosperity if we are conceived of as welcome members of the European club."
The European Commission fined Intel EUR1.06bn last May for violating EU antitrust rules, but Mr O'Hara said the 
company's financial support for the pro-Lisbon camp - estimated at EUR200,000 ($293,000, £183,000) - was 
unrelated to its appeal against the fine.
"Are we trying to curry favour with the Commission? Nonsense. This is a legal case and it's going to be dealt with 
over the next couple of years as an exclusively legal case," Mr O'Hara said.
Describing how the company became involved in the campaign, he said: "It was something I initiated. It wasn't 
something that Intel was thinking about at all."
Another pro-Lisbon campaigner is Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the Irish airline, who says EU and 
eurozone membership "rescued us from [Ireland's] appalling decade of economic mismanagement".
A coalition of 54 business groups, including the American Chamber of Commerce, the Irish Banking Federation and 
the Irish Exporters Association, said on Wednesday: "A No vote would leave a huge question mark over Ireland's 
relationship with the EU and would undermine our ability ... to compete on European and global markets."
But Declan Ganley, a No campaigner, said: "In the Lisbon treaty there's nothing about creating jobs, nothing about 
helping economic recovery."
All 27 EU nations must approve the treaty if it is to take force. The main doubt concerns the Czech Republic, whose 
president, Václav Klaus, has resisted signing the charter.
The referendum result is expected on Saturday.

BOOK REVIEWGetting to Plan BBreaking Through to a Better Business ModelBy John Mullins and Randy Komisar 
Harvard Business Press, $29.95/ £19.99
Here is bad news and good news for budding entrepreneurs who spend years trying to get their initial master plan 
to work. The bad news is that not only do most plan As fail, but most great companies have achieved their success 
by moving quickly from plan A to plan B, C, D or E.
The point is made by John Mullins and Randy Komisar in Getting to Plan B. Mullins, an associate professor of 
management practice at London Business School, had analysed what happened to participants in the LBS 
entrepreneurship summer school he had been running for five years. One finding was that 60 per cent of the new 
businesses still operating were no longer based on the ideas that the owner-managers first contemplated.
"These entrepreneurs are among the lucky few," says Mullins, who wrote The New Business Road Test (2003) to 
help people assess ideas for start-ups.His analysis fits with general research that suggests it takes 58 new product 
ideas to deliver just one success.
Komisar, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm, and author at the height of the 
dotcom boom of The Monk and The Riddle, a popular book about entrepreneurship with a philosophical twist, writes 
from the investor's point of view. He relates how early last year, he and fellow partners gathered together the heads 
of several early-stage companies that Kleiner had backed. Two-thirds admitted they had abandoned the original 
idea they hadtaken Kleiner's money to develop.
Like Mullins, Komisar brings an intimate understanding of businesses that have to change the blueprint. In the 
1980s, as a lawyer, he represented many of the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who had started their companies in 
Why start-ups must plan to change plans
their garages. He joined Apple, where he was responsible for licensing and technology acquisitions but left to form 
Claris, which Apple later bought.
The good news is that Komisar and Mullins say their book can greatly improve the chances of start-ups emulating 
the success of globally successful businesses that have ventured far from their original strategy, such as Apple, 
payment system PayPal, fashion retailer Zara, no-frills airline Ryanair or internet call business Skype.
Apple's creation of the iTunes music store and the iPod moved the PC maker into completely new territory. 
However, it used or adapted bits of other business models to make it work. For instance, it took Gillette's idea of 
selling cut-price razors in order to make the money on replacement blades and turned it on its head, selling music 
at a mere 99 cents so consumers would pay for pricey iPods.
The original plan of PayPal's Max Levchin, to develop security software for the Palm Pilot handheld device, proved 
hopeless. His second idea, for cryptography software, also bit the dust. It was only with Plan F, which involved 
enabling users to move cash securely from one Palm Pilot to another, that he got near a decent business idea. 
Even then the business model was not quite right.
Levchin's breakthrough was pure accident. Having built a web-based demonstration version of the software, he 
found people preferred to use this to move money rather than something on a handheld device. Fortunately, he 
swallowed his pride and focused on the website version to create what would eventually become PayPal, now the 
dominant system for paying securely for online purchases.
The model outlined by Mullins and Komisar has five key elements - much of which, it has to be said, comprise some 
fairly basic home truths. Their best advice is probably for founders to record systematically the leaps of faith they 
make and the hypotheses that grow out of those in a process they call dashboarding. Scientists do this in their 
sleep, they say, but it is a discipline that those caught up in the cut and thrust of building a business often fail to 
follow. This is likely to be the greatest help for entrepreneurs who need to get from plan A to plan B following the 
principle that what gets measured gets done.
If the advice at times seems a bit obvious, their achievement is to lay it out in an easily understood and digestible 
format. In this way, it is both a handbook for those already on the way to building a successful business as well as 
encouraging others to think they could do it.
If that was their plan, they have achieved it first time round.

Fund managers are on the prowl for companies that could be caught up in the wave of mergers that is expected 
across Europe in the coming weeks.
Kraft's $10.2bn offer for Cadbury earlier this month may be just the taster of further to come, say some. Near the 
top of their list are Aer Lingus, the Irish airline that has a market capitalisation of EUR350m and net cash of about 
EUR330m; Bloomsbury, the publishing company that has £37m in cash; and Man Group, the hedge fund manager 
that currently looks relatively cheap, trading on 14 times next year's earnings, and offering a 9 per cent dividend 
yield.
AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical giants that boast strong credit ratings and balance sheets, 
may also be looking to acquire smaller biotech companies to bolster their drug offerings.
There are several factors fuelling the confidence that takeover activity is about to return. With deposit rates hovering 
near zero, takeovers tempt companies that have large cash reserves and want to improve their return on capital. 
But groups with less cash can also shop around as it is quite easy to raise funds in corporate debt markets at the 
moment, say analysts. Also, they face little competition from the private equity sector as many firms took a hit at the 
height of the financial downturn last year and are still struggling to meet commitments. Sterling's current weakness 
also offers the chance for European and US companies to consider taking over UK rivals.
"It's very important for companies to be able to continue to cut costs and drive earnings growth," claims George 
Godber, co-fund manager of S&W Matterley's undervalued returns fund. "If you are a cash-rich company at the 
moment, you can acquire a smaller or weaker competitor without the competitive threat of private equity."
Currently, deals are more likely to be funded by companies with better balance sheets as lending by banks remains 
constrained, says Paras Anand, head of European equities with F&C.
Prepare to surf a wave of mergers
"People are willing to assess more closely whether one business will add value to another one and the economies 
of scale that deals are likely to achieve will come under scrutiny," he says. "Executives are looking to bolster growth 
in what looks like a weak year, but they want to take a disciplined approach."
After pharmaceuticals, it is the airline, financial services and media sectors where consolidation is most anticipated.
Aer Lingus remains under hostile takeover pressure from its low-cost rival Ryanair, for example.
The fund management sector is also expected to see a spate of takeovers, following BlackRock's purchase of BGI 
from Barclays and Aberdeen Asset Management's acquisition of Credit Suisse Asset Management.
Another way to profit from the trend is to take bigger stakes in boutique finance companies and investment banks 
such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - as they may well see revenues rise if business gathers pace.
A few months ago, Bruce Wasserstein, chief executive at Lazard forecast that there would be a "gradual increase" 
in "traditional" M&A activity that would peak in four years' time.
So far, Wasserstein's predictions appear to be on target as Lazard's balance sheet looks rosier than it was a year 
ago.
The company's revenues from M&A activity exceeded expectations in the second quarter, rising to $135m from 
$97m in the previous three months. Expecting a flurry of deals, the company also bolstered its earnings estimates 
for next year from $2.15 to $2.40 per share.

European equity markets fell on Thursday after unexpectedly weak US housing data left a cloud over construction 
and building materials stocks.
HeidelbergCement fell in spite of ratings agency Moody's Investors Service changing its outlook on the cement 
maker's B1 rating to positive from negative. Analyst Matthias Hellstern was impressed with the success of the 
company's new share issue this week, which raised EUR2.25bn.
But the shares, which had risen more than 10 per cent since Monday's placement, were down 4.7 per cent to 
EUR42.40 on Thursday, making it the worst performer on the FTSE Eurofirst 300.
The pan-European index ended the session down 1.9 per cent to 987.37, its biggest loss in three weeks.
Swiss cement group Holcim fell 1.7 per cent to SFr70.90 while French construction group Bouygues lost 3.2 per 
cent to EUR34.67 and Spain's Sacyr-Vallehermoso fell 2.7 per cent to EUR12.76.
Airline stocks reacted to research by Citigroup that noted that over the past three months, many shares in the 
sector have doubled from their year-lows "based purely on appetite for early cyclicals".
But analyst Andrew Light warned that the sector was "still suffering from overcapacity, inefficient cost structures and 
depressed demand", and expected the industry to make record losses this year. Citi's top picks were the "recent 
laggards", among them Lufthansa and Ryanair.
But the broker downgraded its ratings on Sweden's SAS and Air France-KLM. "These are among the strongest 
performers of the last three months and are vulnerable to any disappointments," Mr Light said.

SAS fell 3.3 per cent to SKr4.7 while Air France lost 3.5 per cent to EUR12.37. Ryanair lost 3.4 per cent to 
EUR3.49 and Lufthansa down 0.8 per cent to EUR12.17.
Hennes & Mauritz, the Swedish fashion group, fell 4.3 per cent to SKr391 after its third-quarter sales disappointed.

SAS fell 3.3 per cent to SKr4.7 while Air France lost 3.5 per cent to EUR12.37. Ryan­air lost 3.4 per cent to 
EUR3.49 and Lufthansa was down 0.8 per cent to EUR12.17.
Hennes & Mauritz, the Swedish fashion group, fell 4.3 per cent to SKr391 after sales for the third quarter 
disappointed.
On the upside, French testing group Bureau Veritas gained 3.4 per cent to EUR37.56 after Morgan Stanley raised 
its recommendation on the stock to "overweight" from "underweight".
Belgian pharmaceutical group Solvay gained 2.4 per cent to EUR75.90 following news reports that a potential 
bidding war was developing around the company's drugs unit.
Reports in the Wall Street Journal suggested that Abbott, Solvay's US partner, had put in a bid to rival an earlier 
offer from Swiss drugmaker Nycomed for a deal valued EUR4bn-EUR5bn.
In the financial sector, Germany's Deutsche Bank fell 2.8 per cent to EUR51.83 after Josef Ackermann, chief 
executive, said heavier regulation would result in lower profits in the industry. "The political will is clear: there will be 
stricter limits for the banking sector and the profitability of the financial sector as a whole will be lower," Mr 
Ackermann told Neue Zuercher Zeitung, a Swiss newspaper.
Local rival Commerzbank was among the worst-performing financial stocks, shedding 3.3 per cent to EUR8.38.
Danish brewer Carlsberg lost 2.9 per cent to DKr382 after the Russian government proposed to triple excise tax on 
beer by 2012.
Last year, Carlsberg, which owns Russia's Baltika, had an almost-40 per cent share of the Russian market.
Another sharp drop in oil prices, which fell below $67 a barrel, put pressure on energy companies.
Spain's Repsol was 2.3 per cent lower at EUR18.61 while France's Total lost 3.4 per cent to EUR40.10.

When Richard Branson called a Boeing executive in 1984 to see if he could buy a used 747 on decent terms, the 
entrepreneur expected his plans for a new airline to be greeted with scepticism.
Instead he found a sympathetic supplier. Start-ups such as Virgin Atlantic, explained the Boeing salesman, RJ 
Wilson, could weaken the grip of large and often state-run carriers. "The reason they carried on talking to me was 
because they needed a competitor to British Airways to have traction in selling - someone to give them a little 
leverage," remembers Mr Branson.
Mr Wilson could not have known then how dramatically commercial aviation would change over the following 25 
years. The biggest airlines, such as BA, would lose more than a little leverage to new entrants such as Virgin, 
Southwest Airlines and Ryanair, whose lower costs, rapid growth and cheap tickets would help democratise air 
travel and pull their larger peers into a seemingly endless loop of fare wars and service expansions.
Now the industry may be on the verge of another dramatic turn. By banding together, forming alliances and joint 
ventures, the old behemoths may have finally found a way to break the vicious cycle - at least on lucrative 
international routes.
Bilateral "Open Skies" treaties have eased access to many international hub airports. Politicians, motivated in part 
by concerns that voters would miss out on the choice in destinations and service offered by a rapidly evolving 
industry, have freed carriers to collaborate with international allies in ways that have made many antitrust lawyers 
nervous.
The friendlier regulatory climate has come as many airlines endure the most difficult decade in their history. 
Terrorist attacks, record fuel costs, bitter labour negotiations, bankruptcy filings and two deep recessions have 
tested more than the resolve of those in the sector.
Aviation: ties in the skies
"In the final analysis, joint ventures  and alliances may be the way out for the legacy airlines," says Vaughn Cordle, 
chief analyst at AirlineForecasts.
Alliances have continued to gain strength in recent years. Following successful efforts to secure immunity from US 
antitrust law, two of the big global alliances, Star and SkyTeam, are now in the process of intensifying the co-
operation between the most powerful members of their respective groupings. This includes unifying fares and sales 
efforts to lucrative corporate clients. Meanwhile, a third big alliance, OneWorld, led by BA and American Airlines, is 
eagerly awaiting word on its immunity application, which it hopes will clear the way for its own transatlantic joint 
venture.
Such ambitious plans have not gone unnoticed. Regulators, politicians, labour leaders and, not least, independent 
competitors, all worry that the big network carriers are about to seize back the skies one transcontinental route at a 
time. In time, they warn, it will be passengers who pay for the legacy airlines' regained dominance.
For an industry beset by cut-throat competition, volatile commodity prices and one of the worst downturns in 
demand in history, the savings made possible by international partnerships hold the promise of stable profits - a 
goal as elusive to many airlines as comfortable economy class seats.
Few analysts doubt these partnerships will continue to flourish; many big airlines have persuaded US regulators to 
grant them antitrust immunity, freeing them to co-ordinate in ways that would have been otherwise impossible given 
the restrictions many countries impose on foreign investment in local airlines.
Through these ventures, airlines such as Air France-KLM co-operate on schedules and fares, co-ordinate sales 
pitches to corporate accounts and consolidate marketing offices and terminal gates. The next step would be joint 
purchasing agreements, generating volume discounts on everything from plastic cups to jet fuel - and maybe even 
multi-million dollar aircraft.
"It's no secret that this industry has failed to earn a reasonable profit over time," says Tom Horton, American 
Airlines' chief financial officer. "One of the structural problems has been extreme fragmentation . . . Alliances are a 
step in the direction of rationalising the industry."
It is little wonder executives at many large carriers regard partnerships as a salvation. And why their unallied peers 
such as Virgin and Emirates argue they will come to dominate the skies, crushing competition.
"If I were chairman of BA or American I would try to get away with it, try to dominate," Mr Branson says. "But that is 
what you have governments for, and that's what you have regulators for."
The upstarts have allies of their own, in Washington and Brussels. A bill now going through Congress could rescind 
US antitrust immunity deals. US Justice department officials have pushed their peers in the transport agency to limit 
the ventures' scope. In Brussels the European Commission is investigating the effects of partnerships on 
competition.
Critics argue that these ventures could undo much of the progress that has been made in the past 30 years towards 
making air travel more affordable. According to the Air Transport Association, a US lobby group, the price of flying 
each mile internationally since 1978, when the US industry was deregulated, has risen just 81 per cent - a far lower 
increase than the rise in cost of many consumer goods.
There are signs the trend has begun to reverse, at least on routes shared by venture partners. From 1999 to 2004, 
air fares in transatlantic markets dominated by the immunised alliances increased significantly compared with other 
international routes, according to the Brattle Group, a research firm.
There are also fears that alliances will eventually impact on domestic markets. US antitrust regulators worry that 
two local allies within the same international venture may find co-ordinating on domestic routes too tempting to 
avoid. Trade unions meanwhile fear airlines will use alliance membership to staff their fleets with pilots and flight 
attendants from countries with lower wages.
Aviation: ties in the skies
Airlines usually defend their alliances and ventures with a simple mantra: a healthy airline is good for employees, 
shareholders and passengers; stable profit growth lowers the cost of capital, which in turn helps keep fares low.
Yet for all their potential benefits, many industry insiders say these ventures fall short of the savings they would 
reap if governments allowed cross-border mergers. At best, alliances and cross-border ventures can help carriers to 
fill empty seats while they bide their time for changes to foreign-investment laws.
"Alliances are much more about the revenue side," says Mark Streeter of JPMorgan Chase. "If you want to 
rationalise costs, you merge."
In a world with no regulatory barriers, he says, BA and American Airlines "would love to explore a merger instead of 
having alliances".
Alliances and ventures currently also lack a means of guaranteeing that vendors will be paid, or a way to back 
those obligations with real assets - restricting their collective business operations and thus their overall purchasing 
power. "Let's say I'm Russia and I want to sell jet fuel to the Star Alliance," says Vicki Bryan of Gimme Credit, a 
debt research firm.
"Who do I go after if Star doesn't meet its obligation?" Alliances "are big franchises that don't own any stores", she 
adds.
Mindful that merger restrictions may still be in place for another decade or two, executives believe their ventures will 
continue to evolve in ways their predecessors would have never thought possible.
Star's immunised venture is seeking ways to harmonise technology processes, from reservations to baggage 
handling, while also cutting costs through the joint purchase of in-flight entertainment systems, catering services 
and fuel.
In what Glenn Tilton, United's chief executive, describes as the "next iteration of the discussion", Star is also 
exploring forming a special-purpose entity to help the venture build a capital structure of its own. Backed by 
members, this vehicle could open up even more possibilities for volume discounts. 
The ability for airlines to forge closer ties with partners has only come after hard-fought battles to secure immunity 
from antitrust rules. SkyTeam's Air France, Czech Airlines and Delta Air Lines won such immunity in 2002. Star's 
Lufthansa and United formed an immunised joint venture in 2003. They will add five others, including Continental 
Airlines, this year.
BA and American Airlines sought immunity to form a venture of their own in 1997 and 2001, only to ditch both 
efforts once they deemed the cost - regulators' insistence that they surrender take-off and landing slots at London's 
Heathrow Airport - too great. The carriers applied a third time last year and expect a decision by the end of October.
Each venture could continue to add members as governments agree to liberalise routes to and from their 
international hubs. Partners are also inching their way towards a situation where one carrier generates as much 
revenue from selling a seat on an ally's flight as they do their own. It is an easier goal to achieve when each partner 
has complementary route networks.
"You want to stop worrying about which carrier a customer is on and say, 'how do we get more business in total?' " 
says Larry Kellner, Continental's chief executive.
For those carriers left outside the various ventures and alliances, the future looks more uncertain, leading to 
questions as to whether they can continue to go it alone or accept the need to join an alliance themselves.
"If they do succeed," says Mr Branson with reference to his arch-rivals BA and American. "I suspect we're going to 
need a big brother."
'Their model is what we're trying to achieve - they were pioneers'
Aviation: ties in the skies
The 1989 leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines, a troubled US carrier, would lay the framework for a new era in 
international air travel.
Twenty years after the buy-out, the joint venture that the Minnesota-based company eventually formed with one of 
its investors - the Dutch airline, KLM - remains the "template" against which all other airline partnerships are 
measured, says Tom Horton, chief financial officer at rival American Airlines. 
"Their model is what we're trying to achieve over the next 18-24 months," says Glen Hauenstein, an executive vice-
president at Delta, now the world's largest airline and a venture partner with Air France-KLM. "Northwest and KLM 
were the pioneers."
Yet the two airlines were not always viewed that way. 
By the late 1980s KLM had grander ambitions than its limited domestic travel market could meet, and it soon sought 
ways to work in partnership with its newfound American investment.
Northwest was an also-ran airline, too. The carrier's hub cities in Minneapolis and Detroit were less than ideal for 
international routes, especially when compared to the coastal strongholds of peers such as American and United 
Airlines.   
But in 1993, the US reached a landmark Open Skies accord with the Netherlands, removing restrictions that had 
limited their airlines' access to each other's airports. KLM and Northwest sought immunity from US antitrust laws, 
and by 1997 had formalised a joint venture.
The two airlines would soon come as close to operating one transatlantic network as possible without actually 
merging. They shared revenue on routes, merged sales forces, honoured one another's frequent-flyer miles, co-
ordinated fares and standardised business-class seats.
By the time Northwest was sold to Delta last year, the venture had created $4bn in additional revenue and 
established the carriers' most profitable routes - such as Amsterdam to Minneapolis - according to a former 
Northwest executive.
Their success has inspired many imitators.
"When you look at something, and say, 'Hey, this is working,' it spurs competition," says Larry Kellner, Continental's 
chief executive. "It says, 'Hey, we better get on board.' You see everyone else look at the model."

The drift away from premium to economy-class air travel was reconfirmed by British Airways, which registered 
another month of falling sales from first- and business-class passengers.
The airline saw premium-class traffic in August fall by 11.9 per cent year on year although "non-premium" economy-
class custom edged up 1.3 per cent.
Total passengers carried during the busy month dipped 1.7 per cent year on year to 3.16m.
Passenger traffic on Asia-Pacific routes was down 13 per cent, but there was a small increase on routes to the 
Americas. Passengers carried on short-to-medium-haul routes in the UK and Europe fell 2 per cent.
The monthly breakdown confirmed trends established this year, as BA continued to grapple with a downturn in 
demand among business travellers.
The airline is also battling against competition from no-frills budget airlines on its less lucrative short-haul routes in 
Europe.
BA, which last month closed a £350m ($571m) issue of convertible bonds to strengthen its balance sheet, saw 
some recovery in demand for cargo services, with cargo load kilometres down 5.4 per cent against a year-to-date 
decline of 9.2 per cent. The overall load factor on flights was 75.9 per cent, up from 75.1 per cent in July.
BA's figures came as rival Ryanair announced it had carried 6.88m passengers across its low-cost network of 
European routes in August.
BA data show drift to economy class
The expansion in passengers carried, up 19 per cent on August last year, was achieved as Ryanair maintained its 
load factor for the month at 90 per cent year on year.
Shares in BA closed up 2½p at 184p, while those in Ryanair finished 6.6 cents higher on Thursday at EUR3.13.
- EasyJet is considering plans to close its East Midlands base and reduce its flying schedule at Luton by 20 per 
cent, placing as many as 230 jobs at risk, in order to redeploy assets to growth markets.
In July, Easyjet said that it would be one of the few airlines to remain profitable in the current year, although 
earnings would drop sharply, and reiterated its desire to build on that success by increasing capacity by 7.5 per 
cent a year over the medium term.
The low-cost airline has waged a long battle with Abertis, the Spanish operator of Luton, and Luton Borough 
Council, which owns the airport, over charges that it claims have risen 25 per cent in the past three years and are 
unsustainable.
Talks over the charges broke down in the past few weeks, prompting EasyJet's management to look for ways to cut 
costs ahead of the winter months.
Luton Borough Council declined to comment but said it had done all it could "to work with EasyJet and other airlines 
to retain and grow their operations during this difficult time brought about by the worldwide recession".
EasyJet also released statistics showing that passenger numbers rose 4.7 per cent year-on-year in August while 
load factors increased from 91.3 per cent to 91.8 per cent. Shares in EasyJet closed up 0.3p at 315.8p.

Losses at Aer Lingus, the former state-owned Irish carrier, increased in the first half as revenues fell because of 
cuts in fares, reduced seat sales and higher fuel costs.
The airline, which has fended off two hostile takeover bids from Ryanair, the rival Irish airline, saw pre-tax losses 
widen from EUR21.3m to EUR81.7m ($116m) in the six months to June 30. The 2008 half-year result included a 
EUR17.6m exceptional charge related to cost reductions.
Total turnover declined from EUR631.8m to EUR555.1m, with the 15.7 per cent fall in fares more than offsetting a 
20.5 per cent rise in ancillary earnings from booking fees and baggage charges. Short-haul passenger numbers 
increased 3.6 per cent to 4.4m but long-haul numbers declined 11.6 per cent to 528,000 as routes to Los Angeles 
and Dubai were discontinued.
With fewer bookings, the cash reserves position also deteriorated, falling EUR654m to EUR440m.
Commenting on the results, Colm Barrington, chairman, said: "While traffic volumes have stabilised, consumer 
confidence remains weak and we see no sign of an improvement in the near term."
He said the board "must now take difficult and necessary steps to address our business model and cost base so 
that we ensure Aer Lingus is viable over the long term".
Christoph Mueller will have a full in-tray as he starts as the new chief executive on Tuesday. Figures published on 
Thursday by the International Air Transport Association underscore that it is not only Aer Lingus that is suffering 
from a decline in demand. Across the industry, the Geneva-based organisation said international passenger 
demand fell 2.9 per cent in July while freight demand was down 11.3 per cent. John Mattimoe, analyst with Merrion 
Aer Lingus losses triple
Stockbrokers, said given the decline in revenues, cost reduction was the only option for re-establishing profitability 
and that it would have to be "significant in scale". However, Mr Barrington admitted on Thursday that it was not just 
the cost base but "the business model" that needed rethinking. Analysts see losses widening to EUR140m for the 
full year - a deterioration of EUR160m if the EUR140m of restructuring charges taken in 2008 is added back. 
Ryanair's January offer at EUR1.40 a share, which was rejected by the board and the government - a 25 per cent 
shareholder - now looks very generous. Ryanair had offered EUR2.80 just weeks after the initial public offering in 
2006. The shares closed on Thursday at 51 cents.

As Ryanair never tires of telling investors, three things matter in a low-fare airline: costs, costs and costs. Thanks to 
a collapse in premium demand, that mantra has begun to echo around the less cheap-and-cheerful carriers. On 
Wednesday, announcing full-year earnings to the end of June, Qantas chief Alan Joyce promised an unyielding 
fixation on overheads to take out $1A.5bn over three years, or roughly 12 per cent of last year's cost base.
Mr Joyce, former head of Jetstar, the airline's discount arm, has little choice. The self-styled "spirit of Australia" has 
been flagging for a while - quite apart from the savage industry downturn. Competition is intensifying, both at home 
and abroad. Singapore Airlines' Tiger, a Jetstar clone, last month began shuttling between Sydney and Melbourne; 
Virgin Blue, the other half of the domestic duopoly that has a combined 95 per cent share, is cooking up an alliance 
with Delta to put pressure on Qantas' trans-Pacific yields. A credit rating downgrade six months ago, meanwhile, 
explains the group's decision to pull a planned 40 per cent float of its frequent flyer programme, its most 
dependable cash-generating asset. (That decision was surely taken with a heavy heart: Air Canada's Aeroplan, 
spun off four years ago, now has a market capitalisation 10 times greater than its former parent.)
Mr Joyce's cost initiatives are nothing extraordinary: scrapping aircraft orders, cutting underperforming routes, 
freezing executive pay. But what they mean, in practice, is further replacement of the old Qantas ways of doing 
things with those of six-year-old Jetstar. Full-year operating profits at the budget offshoot, at $107Am, were more 
than 25 times better than the core Qantas brands; it will soon compete directly with its parent on domestic routes, to 
counter Tiger. Squinting into the distance, the group foreswore any earnings guidance. But now, and for the 
foreseeable future, cheap is cheerful.

Lombard: Why Turquoise backers have no reason to feel blue
Lombard: Why Turquoise backers have no reason to feel blue

Vexed by established airlines' high prices, lack of flexibility and general disdain for customer wellbeing, a low-cost 
carrier, Air Turquoise, is born. Together with other airlines set up on the same basis, it triggers a revolution: fares 
come down, restrictions are lifted and - miracle of miracles - British Exchangeways, LuftBörse and the other 
incumbents start to treat their customers with more respect.
In a nutshell, that's the story of Turquoise, the pan-European share trading facility, now "exploring strategic 
options", or, more bluntly, touting itself around for a potential sale. But unlike EasyJet or Ryanair, Turquoise's 
founders were not a grinning Greek or an irascible Irishman, but the passengers themselves - frequent flyers from 
nine investment banks.
Does it matter to these backers exactly what the fate of Turquoise will be? Probably not. It has already put the wind 
up incumbents, helped force prices down and catalysed innovation. On this side of the Atlantic, Chi-X, another 
trading platform, deserves the credit for being the first to rattle the London Stock Exchange, Deutsche Börse and 
competitors. But it was Turquoise and its high-rolling backers that captured most of the headlines.
If you want proof of the changes wrought by competition, simply observe the LSE's recent moves. Even Dame 
Clara Furse, always a staunch defender of the LSE's inherent superiority, bowed to the new reality by flexing the 
exchange's tariffs before stepping down as chief executive. Her successor, rally-driving Xavier Rolet, has 
accelerated the process. On September 1, the LSE will switch back to a model offering volume discounts to 
investment banks, the core customers that Mr Rolet - a former investment banker himself - has been courting 
assiduously.
Turquoise was no mere stalking horse. When the liquidity provision agreement Turquoise signed with its backers 
expired in March, the value of trades on the platform dropped to the same level as rivals, but they have revived 
Lombard: Why Turquoise backers have no reason to feel blue
since - evidence, its fans say, that Turquoise remains a valuable property. Of course, this may be trader talk. On the 
other side, you're still as likely to hear the LSE extol its arch-rival's strengths as you are to hear Michael O'Leary 
sing the praises of British Airways. But the banks can afford to be smug: whatever happens to Air Turquoise, they 
know they can now count on cheap flights long into the future.
Risky business
"What are the risks?" As the world slowly emerges from recession, this will almost certainly be the most popular 
question posed by boards this autumn. (It would be nice to think, in the light of continuing concern about excessive 
remuneration that "How much?!" would come in a close second, but I doubt it).
Expansion. Acquisition. Capital raising. Even, if credit availability improves, added leverage. "What are the risks?"
If Sir David Walker has his way, there will soon be more people posing that question. His review of financial 
companies' governance recommends they establish a separate board risk committee, employ an independently 
appointed chief risk officer (CRO) and publish a separate risk report within the accounts.
This emphasis on structure is understandable, but it may be misguided.
Research for the Financial Reporting Council, sponsored by the ICAEW Foundation, is examining how boards of 
non-financial companies satisfy themselves that risk is being managed effectively. Consultation closed on Tuesday 
and the results will come out next month, but it will be no surprise if non-financial companies consider the existing 
emphasis - through the governance code and so-called Turnbull guidance on internal control - to be adequate. 
Where risk can't be quantified numerically, it ought to be part of normal board and management responsibility and, 
if the credit crunch has achieved nothing else, it should have ensured that all companies reassess their appetite for 
risk, regularly and rigorously. No need for added bells and whistles.
But, as Jonathan Hayward of Independent Audit, which is conducting the study, points out, it is worth asking 
whether the Walker structure is necessary even at banks. The problem with over-centralised risk management is 
that it could foster complacency. For tough decisions, the rubber stamp from the CRO is all that's needed. Is it a 
coincidence that Standard Chartered and HSBC, which eluded the worst impact of the crisis, largely devolved risk 
management through their organisations? Rather than structural change, companies should be striving for cultural 
change with the goal that everyone, from loan officers and production workers up to the board, has to come up with 
a satisfactory answer to the question "What are the risks?".

Ryanair on Monday raised the stakes in its battle to drive down its airport landing costs by announcing the ending of 
almost all flights from Manchester.
The Irish low-cost carrier, which has long campaigned to reduce charges at the largest UK airport outside London, 
said dropping nine of its 10 destinations would cost 600 jobs.
Last week it said it would open a new base with 14 routes at nearby Leeds Bradford airport in a $140m (£86m) 
investment creating 100 jobs.
"Ryanair continues to lower fares to encourage travel, but with passengers paying lower fares airports must lower 
their charges - particularly high cost airports like Manchester, London Stansted and Dublin," the airline said.
"Ryanair had offered new routes, traffic and growth to Manchester airport but since they prefer to preserve their 
high cost base than to grow, Ryanair will now switch/close nine Manchester routes to East Midlands, Leeds 
Bradford and Liverpool from October 1 resulting in the loss of 600,000 passengers per year and up to 600 jobs at 
Manchester."
However, Manchester airport spokesman  Five of the destinations are already served by other carriers. Only 
Bremen, Cagliari, Marseilles and Shannon would be unserved from October 1.  said the impact would not be as 
severe as Ryanair claimed. There would be few direct job losses but could be some among baggage handlers and 
check-in staff. "Low-cost carriers do not support as many jobs as scheduled airlines," an airport spokesman said.
The council-owned airport was willing to reduce the £3 per passenger charge Ryanair pays but not by as much as 
the airline wanted, the spokesman said, as it would have to be offered to other carriers.
Ryanair to end most Manchester flights
"We are a commercial operation and so are they and we could not meet in the middle.
"We don't believe £3 a passenger is unreasonable. Clearly, Ryanair do and that's regrettable.
"We've consistently cut our charges for the last 15 years even when faced with increased costs such as security. "
Manchester is suffering in the recession but its range of business and long-haul flights has protected it somewhat. 
Passenger numbers are down 6 per cent year on year, compared with 12 per cent for all airports. It still hosts 65 
airlines serving 200 destinations. Some 35 airlines have collapsed or left in the last 12 months.
It has made 100 redundancies among its 3,000 staff and expects to serve 20m passengers this year.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said last week that high-cost airports had no future as even airlines such 
as British Airways are cutting costs. Manchester has invested £80m in terminal improvements and wants to recoup 
some of that money from airlines through charges.
"Ryanair may not want better facilities but their passengers do," said an airport spokesman.
The airline, which recently scaled down its winter programme from Stansted, typically reduces activity during the 
winter months.

A $140m (EUR99m, £85m) investment by Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, in Leeds Bradford International Airport 
will be a big shot in the arm for the regional economy, say local business and political leaders.
Andrew Carter, joint leader of Leeds city council, said the decision by Ryanair, which is to set up its 11th UK cetnre 
at the airport, to base two aircraft there when it was cutting back at others because of the recession showed "a 
huge amount of confidence in our city region".
Ryanair said it would create 100 direct jobs and sustain up to 1,000 others in the area as it served 14 new routes.
Mr Carter said: "It is a very positive move. They are a very successful company and it is great they have chosen to 
locate here."
He said the challenge was to ensure that overseas visitors were attracted to Yorkshire. Ryanair claims they could 
spend EUR64m (£55m, $91m) annually.
Ryanair is one of the few airlines still expanding and it expects to double its passenger numbers at Leeds Bradford, 
where it already operates flights to Dublin, Girona and Alicante, to more than 1m annually from March next year 
when the new routes open. This would boost the numbers using the airport by 20 per cent. It aims to attract local 
passengers who currently travel to Manchester for holiday flights.
The move vindicates the decision by five local councils in 2007 to sell the airport for £145.5m to Bridgepoint Capital, 
the private equity firm.
Ryanair launches new base in Leeds
Bridgepoint is investing more than £80m at the site, including a £28m terminal building to increase capacity to 5m 
passengers a year. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said that this was a big factor in his company's 
decision.
John Parkin, airport chief executive, said the announcement guaranteed growth next year. "This is a major 
milestone in the 78-year history of this airport, particularly in the current market."
Leeds Bradford served 2.8m passengers in 2007 and expects that to fall about 7 per cent to 2.6m this year. That 
compares with a 12 per cent year-on-year fall across UK airports as a whole.
The only access to the airport is by road through the Leeds suburbs, and the airport is lobbying for a light railway 
connection. However, Mr O'Leary said the time and money saved by not having to go to Manchester meant 
passengers would still come.
More than 3m people a year travel from Yorkshire to Manchester to fly to short-haul destinations and the airport is 
seeking to capture most of that market. Ryanair will add flights to tourism hot spots such as Faro and Krakow to 
existing routes.
The airline recently announced winter cutbacks at Stansted airport and froze expansion at its nine other UK bases. 
But Mr O'Leary on Tuesday said it was committed to expansion at lower-cost airports. In typically blunt style, he 
said there was little sign of recession-hit Britons sacrificing summer holidays abroad: "The weather's rubbish and so 
is the cricket. People want a couple of weeks in the sun. The only people I know who are staycationing are boring 
buggers like Gordon Brown."
Commenting on recent remarks by Lord Adonis, transport secretary, that high-speed rail could replace the need for 
short-haul European travel, he questioned his education. "He missed at school that the UK is still an island." 
However, Mr O'Leary agreed that rail could replace most domestic flights.
Airline seeks happy landings with cut-price fee deals
Michael O'Leary, the combative airline chief executive, calls it the "Ryanair effect".
For some critics that might mean swarms of stag parties cavorting in city bars across Europe. But for the 34 cities 
around the continent where Ryanair bases its aircraft it means jobs and spending power.
The company claims that for every 1m passengers using an airport, 1,000 jobs are sustained. It also quotes 
industry figures that the average airline passenger spends EUR430 (£367) at their destination.
On these measures its 11 UK bases preserve 29,000 jobs and generate £7bn for the UK economy. However, the 
company's hunt for lower fees has increasingly taken it to mainland Europe.
What is clear is that Ryanair gives small airports critical mass and puts cities such as Treviso (for Venice) on the 
map. Bristol saw passenger numbers rise from 1.5m to 6m after dropping its objections to low-fare airlines.
But the effect can be double-edged. Ryanair succeeds by negotiating cut-price landing fee deals. This year it 
moved an aircraft from Liverpool to Naples, with the loss of 50 jobs, citing high UK taxes.
"We carry 67m passengers [annually]," it said. "That is true whether we do it based primarily in the UK and Ireland 
or Spain and Italy. Airports in Spain and Italy are giving us amazing deals because they realise they will get the 
volume they need."

BA short haul: Ryanair , but run by a politer Irishman
BA short haul: Ryanair, but run by a politer Irishman

British Airways is in a "fight for survival", according to chief executive Willie Walsh. On Friday it revealed a pre-tax 
loss of £148m for the past quarter. It is haemorrhaging cash. The desperate condition of the national flag carrier 
provokes one crucial question for the City: what impact will BA's travails have on its corporate entertaining?
Earlier this week BA abolished canapés from long haul and sandwiches from short hops. Will investors and 
corporate travel buyers face the same sumptuary clampdown? Will they be fobbed off with a pretzel and a cup of 
tap water in place of a blow-out at Coq d'Argent? Likely so. An official told Lombard: "Senior management take on 
board what is being done to customers. There will be no exclusive lunches."
BA has been battered by the slump in long haul business travel. In short haul it has suffered from the competition of 
budget airlines, whose profits have been resilient in the face of the recession. Here, BA may increasingly resemble 
Ryanair, only run by a politer Irishman. In a conference call on Friday, Mr Walsh dropped hints about raising 
charges for heavy luggage. He has yet to propose surcharging heavy passengers à la Michael O'Leary.
Fans of BA believe that the bulk of its problems are cyclical. But the airline may be more exposed than they think to 
the phenomenon of business obsolescence that finished off Woolies. The low-cost carriers have exposed how 
much of a commodity air travel is, creating a generation of consumers unwilling to pay extra for a trolley dolly's 
smile. In these circumstances, a business lumbered with such legacy costs as a final salary pension scheme is at a 
distinct disadvantage to rivals that are not. On Friday, one analyst consoled himself that "the tea and biscuits at 
BA's presentations are laid on by UBS".
Australian rules
BA short haul: Ryanair , but run by a politer Irishman
Sometimes even an English cricket fan would have to admit that the Aussies do it better. Melbourne-based mining 
giant BHP Billiton is electing a chairman . Under an old convention, the ballot is secret. The board does not hold an 
open vote as at most UK companies. This has two advantages. First, would-be bosses are less tempted to engage 
in heavy-handed lobbying of directors. Second, if they get in, they are not in position to punish board members who 
voted for a rival, by squashing all their pet projects.
Transparency is essential to good governance, says Roger Barker of the UK's Institute of Directors. But he adds: 
"On this one decision of who facilitates board meetings, I can see good reasons for the way BHP Billiton does it."
The two candidates present an interesting contrast. One is Jacques Nasser, whose stint as a cost-cutting chief 
executive of Ford earned him international fame and the soubriquet "Jac the Knife". The other is John Schubert, a 
bank chairman who is less well-known outside Australia. Both hail from Melbourne. It is invidious for a Brit to ask 
whether a candidate from Sydney would have been short-listed.
Macrodelusional
To the outsider, the current debate in Westminster and the City on macroprudential regulation is of primarily 
anthropological interest. One might observe a theological dispute among Tanna Islanders with similar dispassionate 
wonder, learning more about the culture of the South Pacific than the possible divinity of Prince Philip.
The emphasis is on devising appropriate organisational structures to rein in banks and investors when asset 
bubbles are inflating and to hearten them during downturns. "Abolish the Financial Services Authority!" is the cry of 
the Tories, given oomph by MPs' condemnation of the agency on Friday. But there is no clear link between the 
structures of organisations and their performance. Structure is bickered over merely because it can be legislated 
for. Luck and the individual flair of officials cannot, and these factors are therefore largely ignored.
Moreover, macroprudential regulation presupposes awareness among regulators of the point at which an asset 
bubble, as it inflates, loses the justification of fundamentals. This would require consensus among economists, in 
itself a logical contradiction. Asset bubbles are only visible in the rearview mirror, like a hedgehog you have just run 
over. The Tannaese, however devout, cannot definitively establish that Prince Philip is an ancestor spirit. We 
cannot know when the economy is heading for a crash. To de-risk markets is to abolish them.

EasyJet forecast on Wednesday a steep fall in profits for the current year to the end of September but signalled an 
end to months of feuding within the board over the pace of the low cost airline's future growth.
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, EasyJet founder and largest shareholder and a member of the board, has backed down in 
his boardroom fight over EasyJet's future capacity growth and has accepted the airline's plan for a growth in 
capacity of 7.5 per cent a year in the medium term.
It is a lower rate of expansion than EasyJet has pursued in recent years, but higher than that previously sought by 
Sir Stelios, who had isolated himself on the board.
The fleet plan presented on Wednesday, which Andy Harrison, chief executive of EasyJet, said had been backed 
unanimously by the board, was virtually identical with the last plan presented three months ago.
The airline said it expected its fleet to grow from 165 at the end of September 2008 to 181 at the end of September 
this year, including nine aircraft held for sale, and to 207 by the end of September 2012.
It would deliver "prudent growth and take advantage of the substantial opportunities to take market share whilst 
maximising margins and delivering positive cash generation."
The airline said it would continue regularly to review the plans "in the light of economic conditions, the market 
opportunities available and the financial strength of the business."
A spokesman for Sir Stelios said he was "comfortable" with the strategy. The recession had not affected passenger 
demand as much as he had feared.
Stelios backs down in EasyJet board dispute
Sir Stelios has gained a new ally on the board, however, through the appointment of Bob Rothenberg, senior 
partner in Blick Rothenberg, the accountancy firm, who was nominated directly by him.
The appointment of Mr Rothenberg was announced alongside a trading statement in which EasyJet said it expected 
a fall of up to 80 per cent in underlying pre-tax profits for the 12 months to the end of September to £25m-£50m 
from £123m a year ago.
Despite the sharp drop in earnings, Mr Harrison said EasyJet expected to be one of the few airlines to make a profit 
this year. The group was gaining market share across Europe and was performing "relatively well in tough trading 
conditions."
EasyJet shares rose 3.8 per cent in morning trading on Wednesday to 288¼p.
Most leading European network carriers have fallen heavily into loss with both British Airways and Air France-KLM 
facing a second consecutive year of losses. The two leading European low cost airlines Ryanair and EasyJet have 
remained in profit, however, as more air travellers trade down and seek lower fares during the deepening recession.
Ryanair, the biggest short-haul carrier in Europe, forecast this week it would more than double its underlying net 
profits in the 12 months to next March.
The Irish airline is pursuing a much more aggressive expansion strategy than EasyJet and is leading a fierce price 
war funded by big savings made in its fuel bill. It has benefited directly from the fall in the oil price from the record 
level of last summer, as it has not been hampered by a legacy of uneconomic fuel hedges.
EasyJet had hedged more of its fuel requirements at higher prices, and is only gradually gaining from the fall in the 
oil price.
In an interim management statement for its third quarter from April to June EasyJet said its total revenues had risen 
by 12 per cent to £721m. It did not disclose profit figures for the quarter.
It has avoided the sharp decline in average fares suffered by many other airlines, and Mr Harrison said EasyJet 
was pursuing a very different strategy to Ryanair.
EasyJet has focused much of its growth at primary airports at London Gatwick, Milan, Paris and Madrid and was 
gaining market share from higher cost traditional carriers on mainline routes, where it could gain higher fares than 
on routes flying to and from secondary airports.
Most of its growth was also coming from non-UK originating passengers with a rise of 12 per cent in the quarter. 
More than half of its passengers now originated from outside the UK.

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has modelled his career as a serial entrepreneur on that of Sir Richard Branson. But it is 
hard to imagine the combative balloonist compromising over a boardroom dispute as resignedly as Sir Stelios just 
has.
The disagreement concerned the impact of the recession on air travel. Sir Stelios, in his younger days a flamboyant 
risk-taker, had pressed apprehensively for EasyJet to freeze capacity in response to the downturn. Disproving 
popular stereotypes, it was the corporate types who now run EasyJet that held their nerve. Having wrangled for 
months with the prince of all things orange, they used Wednesday's trading statement to promise a capacity 
expansion of 7.5 per cent annually for the next few years. The fleet will grow by 52 aircraft, as previously expected.
In fairness, Sir Stelios, whose family owns 38 per cent of EasyJet, changed his mind when the facts changed. 
Government intervention averted financial Armageddon, alleviating his worst fears. The chortling Monaco resident 
has meanwhile claimed credit for EasyJet's promise to prioritise a 15 per cent return on capital that will bolster the 
dividend yield. The broader aim is to emphasise differences with cost-cutting, growth-driven Ryanair. EasyJet, you 
understand, is classy cheap rather than just plain cheap.
The airline is entering its mature years alongside its 42-year-old founder. It is a far cry from the harum-scarum early 
days. Then, Sir Stelios, born not so much with a silver spoon in his mouth as a whole canteen of hallmarked cutlery, 
sometimes mucked in to clean the aircraft. He would hardly have intervened so fractiously in EasyJet's growth 
plans had subsequent ventures prospered half so well. Sir Richard may one day fly us to the edge of space. But his 
acolyte has been grounded by a more modest record and his shrewd management by Easyjet's career executives.

sensibly and safely wanted to dispose of an oil platform at sea. But this became a PR disaster when hijacked by 
environmental protesters and mishandled by Shell.
Vestas logically plans to transfer production for American customers to the US. But British employees, disgruntled 
at losing their jobs, are resisting alongside green campaigners. Wednesday, a judge impatiently dismissed bungled 
legal efforts to begin evicting 11 workers by Vestas, on Wednesday night unavailable for comment. According to the 
RMT union, letters of dismissal were delivered inside boxes containing free pizzas, in an application of the Trojan 
Horse ruse to staff catering. An RMT official, enjoying inherent absurdities more than is quite decent, said: "The 
guys say they are gasping for a curry and a pint, so perhaps the next set of papers will turn up tucked inside a naan 
bread."
Hold the heroin treatment
If you are peckish, you might fancy a dab of French's Mustard on your bacon sandwich. Alternatively, if you are a 
junkie going cold turkey, how about some Suboxone? Surprisingly, Reckitt Benckiser caters to both needs. It is best 
known as a purveyor of condiments and cleaning products. But two treatments that help addicts kick heroin have 
supplied 7 per cent of sales and 18 per cent of operating profits at the half-year stage.
That worried analysts, who are almost as prone to the vapours when a favoured stock is doing well as when it is 
doing badly. Generic drugmakers may steam in and grab a chunk of Suboxone's lucrative market when its orphan 
drug status expires in the US in October. Surely Reckitt has tricks up its sleeve to bolster Suboxone's brand among 
physicians, perhaps through new delivery technology?
Well, no. Suboxone and companion product Subutex are anachronistic hangovers from the nineties, like a faith in 
New Labour. Their development began before Reckitt of the UK merged with Benckiser of the Netherlands in 1999 
to create a consumer products group focused on such "powerbrands" as Cillit Bang, the cleaner named, according 
to urban fable, after a Turkish belly dancer.
Diminishing income from Suboxone and Subutex will lift a monkey from Reckitt Benckiser's back. Involvement in 
the hit-and-miss business of pharmaceuticals development inspires expectations more volatile than those triggered 
by new floor cleaners. Investors sometimes need weaning off legal drugs, just as druggies do with the illegal kind.

BA cuts canapés to save cash

Flying business class on British Airways may never be the same again. From next Monday, the airline announced 
on Wednesday, it will be axing the canapés and chocolates on long-haul flights.
As part of its cost-cutting drive, budget travellers on BA's short-haul journeys will have to make do with pretzels and 
a drink instead of a sandwich, and paper cups rather than bottles of water.
In a move expected to save the airline £22m (EUR26m), BA said passengers on flights lasting less than two-and-a-
half hours would not receive a meal after 10am. Nor would they be able to buy food, though a free breakfast would 
still be provided on early-morning flights.
The steps, announced just as the holiday season enters full swing, are aimed at shoring up BA's finances. The 
airline is burning through £1.4m a day. After losing £401m last year, it is heading for another heavy loss and plans 
to raise £680m in cash to help it survive the crisis that has engulfed the world's aviation industry.
The decision to cut back on catering will narrow the difference between BA and low-cost carriers, said Andrew 
Lobbenberg, transport analyst at RBS. But he added that unlike Ryanair "they are still giving you a free can of drink 
and a packet of crisps and their prices aren't that different".
Airlines have been trimming complimentary food since 9/ll though some airlines subsequently reversed the 
decision. Swiss and Brussels Airlines both restored free meals on some flights after changing to buy-on-board 
services in a bid to reposition themselves in the market.
BA cuts canapés to save cash
BA said its dwindling business class passengers on short-haul flights would continue to receive lunch and dinner. 
Premium travellers on long-haul flights would receive a smaller second meal, with chocolates and canapés taken off 
the tray.
Extra food would be available from the galley kitchen. "When you fly with British Airways the inflight catering is top 
class and, unlike some other airlines, it is free. It is not unusual to make small changes to avoid waste and save 
money where it makes sense and it meets customers' changing tastes," BA said.
The airline is locked in talks with trade unions representing cabin crew, check-in and ground services staff as it 
seeks to implement cuts including the loss of more than 3,700 jobs. Thousands of staff have already offered to take 
pay cuts by opting for periods of unpaid leave, part-time or unpaid work.

If Hitler invaded hell," Winston Churchill once remarked, "I would make at least a favourable reference to the Devil 
in the House of Commons." Ryanair views the downturn in much the same way. "Even during deep recessions," 
chief executive Michael O'Leary crowed on Monday, Ryanair "continues to deliver growth". While other European 
airlines are losing money and having to cut back on routes, the low-cost carrier is expanding capacity, slashing 
ticket prices to fill seats. Everyone is hurting in the tough times. But Ryanair's higher-cost competitors are hurting 
more.
This should make Ryanair, already Europe's largest airline by market capitalisation, a recession winner. Expanding 
through the downturn will allow it to increase market share which it can, then milk when the recovery comes. It is a 
credible theory, yet not without risks. In the first quarter, Ryanair carried 11 per cent more passengers than it did in 
the same period last year. But in spite of the rise in traffic, ticket sales of EUR609m were 3 per cent less. Indeed, if 
it wasn't for the EUR152m fall in fuel costs and the EUR165m of ancillary revenues - which includes the penalties 
passengers are charged for extra bags or failing to check-in online - Ryanair would have lost money, instead of 
earning EUR123m.
Investors are willing to tolerate lower profits now if it means higher profits later - but only up to a point and at the 
right price. They took fright after Mr O'Leary warned that lower fares per passenger meant that full-year profits 
would come in at the bottom end of his forecast EUR200m-EUR300m range; Ryanair's share price dropped by 9 
per cent. Even so, Ryanair shares still trade on almost 20 times the new forecast earnings. Looking cheap and 
being cheap are not the same thing.

Ryanair, Europe's largest short-haul airline, increased its first-quarter profits strongly thanks to the steep fall in fuel 
costs and said it was to intensify its price war against rival carriers.
Its share price fell by nine per cent or 31 cents, however, to close at EUR3.08, as it warned full-year earnings would 
be towards the lower end of previous guidance because of big cuts in air fares.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the group's outlook for the full year to March 2010 remained 
"cautious".
Average fares would be "significantly lower than last year - at, or even slightly above, the minus 15 to 20 per cent 
range previously guided". Net profits would be "towards the lower end" of the EUR200m-EUR300m ($284m-$426m) 
range previously forecast - but still more than double last year's EUR105m before exceptional charges.
The Irish low-cost airline is cutting fares drastically during the recession both to fill seats in its still rapidly increasing 
fleet and to capture market share. Its average fare level fell by 13 per cent year-on-year in its first quarter from April 
to June.
Lufthansa - Europe's biggest aviation group measured by turnover - admitted the scale of the price war it  faced and 
said it was experiencing a "massive" slide towards cheaper tickets.
Roland Busch, finance and personnel director for the Lufthansa airline division, told staff the airline had been 
affected by an "enormous" loss of market share everywhere in Germany and in particular away from its main 
Frankfurt and Munich hubs.
Ryanair raises profits in price war
In stark contrast to most traditional network carriers, which are shrinking and suffering increasing losses during the 
worst of the recession, Ryanair is taking advantage of its position as the lowest cost producer to continue to 
expand, adding routes around Europe.
Passenger numbers rose by 11 per cent year-on-year from 15m to 16.5m in the three months from April to June. 
The group was on track to increase passengers by 15 per cent from 58m to 67m in the current year to the end of 
March. Ryanair staged a big turnround in the first quarter from a pre-tax loss of EUR90.5m a year ago to a pre-tax 
profit of EUR134.6m. Fuel costs fell by 42 per cent to EUR214m.
A year ago it was affected by exceptional charges of EUR111.5m with a EUR93.6mwritedown on its 29.8 per cent 
shareholding in rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus and a EUR17.9m accelerated depreciation charge on sale of older 
aircraft. In the latest quarter it had a EUR13.5m writedown on Aer Lingus.
Excluding one-off char-ges, pre-tax profits jumped from EUR21m to EUR148.1m. Operating profits before 
exceptional items rose from EUR25.7m to EUR154.7m.
Turnover was nearly stable at EUR774.7m, down from EUR776.9m a year ago, as a 13 per cent drop in yields 
exceeded the 11 per cent rise in passengers. Non-fare revenues from sources such as commission earnings on 
hotel, travel insurance and car rental bookings rose by 13 per cent to EUR165.3m.

Ryanair, Europe's largest short-haul airline, reported a jump in profits on Monday as it gained from a steep decline 
in its fuel bill and stepped up its price war against rivals.
But the shares fell more than 9 per cent in afternoon Dublin trading as Ryanair warned full-year earnings would be 
at the lower end of its previous guidance due to the big cuts in fares.
The Irish low-cost carrier is posing a tough challenge to competitors around Europe, as it continues to cut fares 
drastically during the recession both to fill seats in its still-rapidly growing fleet and to capture market share.
As it aggressively discounts fares, it said on Monday its yields - average fare levels - had fallen by 13 per cent in its 
first quarter from April to June. In an ominous warning to rivals of the severity of the battle ahead, it forecast a drop 
in yields of 20 per cent or slightly more for the full year to March 2010.
In stark contrast to most traditional carriers, Ryanair is taking full advantage of its undisputed position as the low-
cost leader to continue to expand, adding operating bases and routes around Europe.
Many leading carriers - including the big three, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and British Airways - have been forced in 
recent weeks to turn to the capital markets to raise fresh funds, but Ryanair said its cash balances had risen to 
EUR2.5bn (£2.17bn) at the end of June, demonstrating the robustness of its low-cost model.
Passenger numbers rose 11 per cent year-on-year to 16.5m in the three months from April to June, and the group 
said it was for a 15 per cent increase to 67m in the full year to next March.
Ryanair raises profits amid price war
Ryanair reported a big turnround in its first-quarter financial performance from a pre-tax loss of EUR90.5m a year 
ago to a pre-tax profit of EUR134.6m.
A year ago it was hit by exceptional charges of EUR111.5m, including a EUR93.6m writedown on the value of its 
29.8 per cent shareholding in Irish rival Aer Lingus and a EUR17.9m accelerated depreciation charge on the sale of 
older aircraft. In the latest quarter it took a further EUR13.5m writedown on the Aer Lingus stake.
Excluding exceptional charges, Ryanair said pre-tax profits jumped from EUR21m to EUR148.1m. Operating profits 
before exceptionals rose from EUR25.7m to EUR154.7m.
Turnover was virtually unchanged at EUR774.7m as the drop in yields exceeded the rise in passenger numbers. 
Ancillary revenues such as commissions on hotel, travel insurance and car rental bookings rose 13 per cent to 
EUR165.3m.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the quarterly results had been distorted by the 42 per cent reduction in fuel 
costs.
A year ago the group was unhedged as the oil price was surging to record levels. It has been able to take full 
advantage of the subsequent fall in the oil price unencumbered by uneconomic hedges, and has locked in the lower 
prices for this year through extensive hedging.
Mr O'Leary said fuel costs had fallen in the quarter by 42 per cent to EUR214m. For the first nine months of the 
current year Ryanair's fuel requirements were 90 per cent hedged at $620 a tonne and n the final quarter they were 
60 per cent hedged at $610 a tonne.
He said that if the group hedged the balance of its fuel at $620 a tonne, it would lock in a full-year fuel cost saving of 
approximately EUR460m.
Fuel is the airline's biggest expense and was still accounting for more than one-third of total costs in the first 
quarter.
Importantly, however, Ryanair also cut other expenses during the quarter with a 5 per cent fall in unit costs 
excluding fuel with reductions in staff, airport and handling costs.
Mr O'Leary said most competitors had recently reported declining traffic, falling yields and substantial losses, which 
he said were "accelerating the pace of airline closures and consolidations."
In recent weeks SkyEurope has sought bankruptcy protection in the Slovak courts and MyAir has ceased 
operations in Italy.
Mr O'Leary repeated his attack on rising air passenger taxes in the UK and Ireland, which he blamed for falling 
tourist numbers. He called on the two governments to follow the lead of the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and 
Greece, which had all either abandoned such levies or had reduced airport charges in order to stimulate tourist 
traffic.
The group's outlook for the full year to March 2010 remained "cautious."
Traffic growth was "strong but at much weaker yields due to the recession and the impact of tourist tax in Ireland 
and the UK. We have limited visibility beyond the next two months but expect passengers to be very price sensitive 
for the rest of the year."
Fuel and other cost savings would be used to fund "continuous fare reductions." As a result yields or average fare 
levels in the current second quarter from July to September would be "significantly lower than last year, at or even 
slightly above the minus 15 to 20 per cent range previously guided."
Ryanair raises profits amid price war
Based on such yields, full-year net profit was expected to be  "towards the lower end of the EUR200m to EUR300m 
range previously guided," but more than double last year's EUR105m before exceptionals.
Shares in Ryanair were EUR0.305 lower at EUR3.06.

Already deep into the recession, Ryanair, the low-cost and low-fare leader in the European airline industry, is 
showing no sign of being forced to abandon its contrarian strategy.
Most airlines are shrinking - removing flights, cutting capacity and grounding aircraft. They face falling revenue, 
mounting losses and shrinking cash piles. Many, including Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and British Airways, have 
had to come to the capital markets for more cash.
But Ryanair has by far the lowest cost base and can therefore act differently.
It is adding aircraft and has recently concluded a $1.5bn (£910m) deal with a syndicate of three banks, backed by 
US Ex-Im Bank guarantees to finance another 55 Boeing jets. It is opening new operating bases and new routes. 
Profits are rising again after a tough 12 months when it was hit by record oil prices.
It is leading the charge to cut fares - in order to fill seats and grab market share - and it is loving it.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the group would be the only big European airline "to deliver 
passenger and profit growth in the current year. The winners in a deep recession will always be those companies, 
such as Aldi, Lidl, McDonald's and Ryanair, who offer lowest prices."
Most of the group's competitors have recently reported declining traffic, falling yields and substantial losses. "This is 
accelerating the pace of airline closures and consolidations," Mr O'Leary said. In recent weeks SkyEurope has 
sought bankruptcy protection in the Slovak courts and MyAir has ceased operations in Italy.
O'Leary sees opportunities in rivals' distress
Mr O'Leary continued to rail on Monday against UK aviation taxes and the high level of charges at BAA's Stansted 
airport, its biggest base in Europe, but the Irish carrier is becoming less dependent on the UK, still its biggest single 
market with 30 per cent of its passengers.
It has become a truly pan-European operator - to a greater extent than any other airline - with 33 bases and more 
than 850 routes. Already Italy is its second-largest market, accounting for 17 per cent of passengers, with Spain 
accounting for 14 per cent.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair, already Europe's biggest short-haul airline, continued "to see enormous opportunities to 
grow our business". He said it was being "besieged" by European airports offering cut-price deals to attract 
Ryan­air services, as it was one of the few airlines growing in the recession.
It is expected to announce a batch of new routes this week. However, pRyanair profit gains in the first quarter were 
driven by lower fuel prices.
A year ago the group was unhedged while oil prices were surging to record levels. It has taken full advantage of the 
subsequent oil price fall and has also locked in the lower prices for this year by extensive hedging. Its full-year fuel 
bill saving could be EUR460m (£397m).
Most ominously for rival airlines, Mr O'Leary warned fuel and other cost savings would be used to fund "continuous 
fare reductions". Average fares for the full year could fall 20 per cent to make sure the airline was filling its growing 
fleet.
It appears that Mr O'Leary is not taking his foot off the throttle - or off the neck of his competitors.

A little more than six months on from the rescue of Alitalia by a consortium of Italian entrepreneurs, the customer 
experience at the Italian flag carrier seems firmly stuck on the ground.
Italian media reports claim that one in three of the airline's flights out of its hub at Rome's Fiumicino airport are 
delayed. This does nothing to dispel the stubborn reputation for poor punctuality spelled out in an adaptation of its 
name during the years of state ownership - "Always late in take-off, always late in arriving".
Rocco Sabelli, chief executive, can point to the dire state of the industry as a first line of defence half a year into his 
captaincy. Never has the sector - from low-cost Ryanair to premium-price British Airways - been battered by so 
much turbulence as it is today.
He can also claim that Alitalia's load factors have improved markedly since the dark days last year when 
passengers feared the company would not survive to honour their tickets by the time they had struggled to check in.
Alitalia's Fiumicino base is far from the ideal home for the newly resuscitated carrier. Macquarie, the Australian 
infrastructure investor, must still be counting its blessings after its near half share of Fiumicino's Aeroporti di Roma 
parent company was bought out in 2007 at top dollar. The Australians had struggled fruitlessly for years to convince 
their Italian partners to invest in long-overdue upgrades. Meanwhile, millions of travellers who have struggled in and 
out of the airport since then will have some sympathy for anyone trying to piece together a service under such 
circumstances.
But Mr Sabelli will have to do better than just listing everyone else's faults if he is to emerge as a credible chief at 
Alitalia. When the CAI consortium that employs him took over the best bits of the old Alitalia, he was eager to 
position himself centre stage as the man with the plan - the "Phoenix" plan, to be precise. His desire for control was 
Alitalia shareholders yearn for tender loving care
apparently all the greater since his former boss at scooter maker Piaggio, the entrepreneur Roberto Colaninno, had 
emerged as a big CAI shareholder and later as chairman of the new Alitalia.
But rumours have surfaced in recent weeks that Mr Sabelli's style is rubbing his 20 or so entrepreneur shareholders 
and 25 per cent partner Air France-KLM up the wrong way. While he has reportedly made it known in Alitalia that 
his business plan is more or less on track, suggestions that he could be replaced hint that a gap may be opening 
between the chief executive and a group of owner shareholders, who expect to be kept constantly in the loop. 
Having stumped up more than EUR1bn ($1.4bn) to finance his trip, some of these shareholders might say they 
have earned that right.
Mr Colaninno, who gave Mr Sabelli the operational room he insisted on, seems so far to have been able to keep 
any shareholder concerns in check. Corrado Passera, the head of Intesa-Sanpaolo, the Italian bank that backed Mr 
Sabelli's chief executive campaign, has also supported him publicly by insisting that 30 years of mismanagement 
cannot be turned round in a few months.
That said, Mr Sabelli might do well to remember that it is precisely when times are tough - for whatever reason - 
that owners as well as passengers require all the tender loving care that can be mustered. Of the two, owners 
require it the most, particularly if results are slow in coming.
Many passengers denied due care and attention will probably still travel - all the more when the choice of 
alternative carriers is pretty limited. Insufficiently pampered owner-investors have what passengers can only dream 
of - the ability to deploy the ejector seat to make way for a pilot with perhaps a keener sense of who is really paying 
for the ticket.
Irish confession
Willie Walsh, BA's Irish chief executive, has agreed to work for free this month and forgo his annual bonus this year 
given the dire situation in the airline industry.
The bishop of Killaloe, also called Willie Walsh, has followed his namesake's example by reducing the annual 
salary of the 120 priests in Ireland's second-biggest diocese by about 10 per cent.
He recently confessed on the radio that the Roman Catholic diocese had lost millions of euros as a result of the 
crash in the value of its investments in Irish bank shares. At their peak these were worth about EUR9m but their 
value has since collapsed to EUR2m.
The bishop candidly confessed that he thought bank shares were one of the safest places to invest legacies left to 
the diocese. They were clearly not. Dublin was forced to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank and inject EUR7bn into the 
Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks to prop them up.

Is Michael O'Leary a child of the Soviet Union, something of a fellow traveller? OK, it might not be the first thing one 
associates with Ryanair's Irish boss, the very personification of raw business drive who turned a struggling low-cost 
airline into a successful profit machine - all the while railing at bloated competitors and deploying a mischievous turn 
of phrase to generate more coverage than any marketing budget could ever deliver.
The reason I ask is that as thoughts now turn to tales of delays and lost baggage, I am transported back to the late 
1970s when as a young westerner living in the Soviet Union I was presented with a vision of the future. It came in 
the form of a prim lecture from an official on the superiority of aviation under communism.
Not only was it far more extensive and cheaper than in the west, it was less elitist. While back home air travel was 
for the few, in the USSR it was for the many - just another mode of public transport. Aeroflot, the national carrier, 
was both the world's biggest airline and one of the cheapest, so catching the red-eye to Vladivostok was as easy as 
hopping on the Number 2 trolley bus on Kutuzovsky Prospekt.
Frankly, it was difficult to know where to start. Maybe with the pervasive, sweet, plasticy smell of the planes or the 
routine delays and constant lack of information. Or how about the flint-faced stewardesses stomping down the aisle 
offering the "choice" of tangy water or tangy water? Or perhaps the unspeakable food, the shabby fittings and the 
bleak, run-down airports in the middle of nowhere. Then who can forget the grumpy staff for whom dialogue was an 
alien concept, preferring instead to find new ways of deploying arbitrary rules and associated punishments. All in all, 
not unlike a rush-hour ride on the Number 2 trolley bus.
Any of this sound familiar? We may have scoffed at the notion of Aeroflot leading the world. But how wrong we 
were. Thirty years on it is clear that far from being a laughable expression of a clapped-out system destined to 
crash under the weight of its internal contradictions, Aeroflot was in fact the pioneer. Low-cost travel today is simply 
Outside Edge: Pioneers of the Ryanair revolution
playing catch-up with those Heroes of the Soviet Union: passengers packed in like sardines, robbed of respect and 
subjected to a baffling array of terms, conditions and penalties. Passengers do not interact with people but with an 
impersonal, unforgiving apparat dedicated to the ruthless pursuit of a (centrally fixed) plan.
The spirit of Aeroflot not only lives on but - in the spirit of letting a thousand flowers bloom - has spawned countless, 
successful western disciples. Twenty years after the collapse of communism and with capitalism now going through 
its own spot of turbulence, revisionism is in the air. Fasten your seatbelts.

Michael O'Leary is not someone to let an inconvenient truth obstruct a higher public relations mission. The 
"unacceptable face of capitalism", as Mr O'Leary's Irish critics have dubbed Ryanair's chief executive, has launched 
a salvo against airport fees in the UK generally and BAA in particular, which owns Stansted, Ryanair's UK base. 
Because they are high, Mr O'Leary is slashing winter flights and moving jets elsewhere.
This is disingenuous. Ryanair, like all airlines, is cutting winter capacity. Furthermore, Stansted has never charged 
airlines as much as its regulators allow. Last year, the fee cap was set at £6.44. Stansted charged £5.50. This gap 
is a consequence of the bargaining power of its main users, Ryanair and EasyJet, and the competition it faces from 
other European airports.
Unlike long-haul carriers, which need to maintain feeder routes into their hubs, low-cost carriers run a series of 
point-to-point businesses. Aircraft are therefore mobile assets that can be parked wherever and whenever it is 
cheapest or most profitable to do so. Ryanair is only responding to market forces. When summer demand returns, 
so will the aircraft. As for UK passenger taxes, these are set to rise by 10 per cent to £11 per passenger in 
November, which Mr O'Leary says damages "London and UK tourism and the British economy generally". It is true

Michael O'Leary is not someone to let a couple of inconvenient truths stand in the way of a higher public relations 
mission. The "unacceptable face of capitalism", as Mr O'Leary's Irish critics have dubbed the chief executive of 
Ryanair, has launched a salvo against airport fees in the UK generally and against BAA in particular, which owns 
Stansted, Ryanair's main UK base. Because they are high, Mr O'Leary is slashing winter flights and moving planes 
elsewhere.
This is disingenuous. Ryanair, like all airlines, usually cuts capacity in winter. Furthermore, Stansted has never 
charged its airlines as much as its regulators allow it. Last year, the fee cap was set at £6.44. Stansted meanwhile 
charged £5.50. This gap is largely due to the bargaining power of its main users, Ryanair and EasyJet, and the 
competition that Stansted faces from other European airports. Unlike long haul carriers, which need to maintain 
feeder routes into their hubs, low-cost carriers run a series of point-to-point businesses. Airplanes are therefore 
mobile assets that can be parked wherever and whenever it is cheapest or most profitable to do so. Ryanair is only 
responding to market forces.
As for UK passenger duties, a government tax, these are set to rise by 10 per cent to £11 per passenger in 
November, which Mr O'Leary says is "damaging London and UK tourism and the British economy generally". It is 
true that UK duties are an anomaly in Europe. Yet the marginal effect of that increase on a holiday's total cost is 
miniscule. The 9 per cent depreciation of sterling against the euro over the past 12 months has had a far greater 
impact - and may even encourage more holidaymakers to visit Britain on Ryanair than it has stopped others 
travelling to Europe.  .

Flu factor adds zest to healthy GSK results

The prospect of a boost to sales from swine flu vaccines and antivirals added excitement to solid second-quarter 
results from GlaxoSmithKline.
More than 700 people, including 31 in the UK, have died from the H1N1 virus, which the World Health Organisation 
says is spreading faster than any previous flu pandemic. Analysts expect it to boost not only GSK but Roche and 
Sanofi-Aventis.
Andrew Witty, chief executive, says GSK has orders for 195m doses of the vaccine it is developing and expects 
more as talks continue with 50 governments.
There are uncertainties over how quickly companies can meet demand.
The vaccine, with shipments due to begin around September, is made by cultivating the virus into an antigen. As 
Novartis and Baxter warned last week, samples are yielding lower than usual amounts of antigen, raising fears of 
shortfalls.
GSK is optimistic about meeting demand. It is also trebling production capacity for Relenza, its antiviral treatment.
GSK's pre-tax profit for the three months to June was up 12 per cent to £2bn on sales that grew 14 per cent to 
£6.7bn compared with a year ago. But in constant exchange rate terms, sales fell 2 per cent and operating profit 6 
per cent. That was in line with forecasts, and the shares dipped 0.6 per cent to £11.54 despite GSK raising its 
dividend from 13p to 14p.
Mr Whitty, appointed last year, is making steady progress with his "grow, deliver and simplify" approach.
Flu factor adds zest to healthy GSK results
In the US, which accounts for one-third of turnover and where it has faced intense competition from generic drugs 
manufacturers, GSK predicts a boost from new drugs after a 15 per cent drop in sales in the quarter.
Diversification is proceeding, with a 14 per cent rise in emerging market turnover, similar growth in vaccine sales 
and a 9 per cent increase in consumer healthcare. Cost reduction is on track.
Mr Whitty accepts that these are "only the first steps" GSK must take to create a better balanced business that 
delivers sustainable growth.
The consensus forecast is for £8.9bn pre-tax profit for the full year, giving a prospective price/earnings multiple of 
10.4 - about right, in spite of the fuss over flu.
Ryanair's Stansted spin
Michael O'Leary's ability to spin a tale has reached a new level this week, along with the gullibility of parts of the 
media in accepting it.
"Ryanair cuts Stansted winter capacity by 40 per cent," claimed his press release.
The assertion was rubbish. But it is almost universally accepted as fact. On the most charitable assessment, he is 
planning to cut Stansted winter capacity by 14 per cent.
The probability is that the year-on-year decline in Ryanair passenger numbers at Stansted will be much lower even 
than that. BAA, Stansted's owner, is forecasting a drop of 6 to 7 per cent.
To get to the claim of a drop of 40 per cent, Mr O'Leary is comparing an apple with a pear. He is comparing the 
number of aircraft he is operating from Stansted, his biggest base, this summer (40) with the number he plans to 
deploy in the winter (24).
But the airline industry is highly seasonal. Comparing Ryanair's summer capacity with its winter capacity at any 
airport is about as useful as saying "ice-cream sales to fall by 40 per cent this winter" or "temperature to fall by 40 
per cent".
Last winter Ryanair operated between 26 and 28 aircraft at Stansted. This year it is planning to operate 24, a 
decline of at most 14 per cent year-on-year and a long way from the claimed fall of 40 per cent.
The decline will doubtless be even less in the number of flights operated year-on-year. Mr O'Leary chose to 
describe only the number of aircraft overnighting at Stansted. He gave no numbers for the volume of weekly flights 
that includes services operating in and out of Stansted from other Ryanair bases.
The summer/winter capacity comparison is about as silly as comparing profits/losses between different quarters of 
the year rather than year-on-year. Not even Ryanair has yet adopted that approach as a new accounting standard.
This week's spin was egregious even by Mr O'Leary's standards. A year ago, when he staged the same show over 
cutbacks at Stansted, at least he had the good grace to compare an apple with an apple. But the result was much 
less impressive.

Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, plans to cut services at London Stansted and Dublin, its two largest 
bases, this winter as it pares loss­making routes and moves aircraft to airports in continental Europe to benefit from 
lower charges.
Michael O'Leary, the group's chief executive, used the capacity cuts as a weapon in his long-running battle with 
Stansted, which is owned by BAA, a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial, and with state-owned Dublin airport, over 
airport fees.
He also blamed the cuts on planned increases in air passenger taxes in the UK and Ireland. Mr O'Leary said: 
"Sadly, UK traffic and tourism continue to collapse while Ryanair continues to grow traffic rapidly in those countries 
that welcome tourists instead of taxing them."
He said the group was planning to cut Stansted winter capacity by 40 per cent. That claim was based on comparing 
summer and winter capacity levels. Ryanair would reduce the number of aircraft operated at Stansted from 40 this 
summer (April to October) to 24 in winter (November to March).
On a like-for-like basis, the number of aircraft to be operated at Stansted will be reduced by 14 per cent to 24 in the 
winter, from 28 per cent a year ago. BAA has forecast a fall of 6-7 per cent in Ryanair passengers at Stansted this 
winter.
The reduction in the number of flights using Stansted could be less than suggested by the cut in the number of 
aircraft based there, because flights from other Ryanair bases or destinations could rise.
Last week Ryanair announced it was adding twice daily flights between Oslo Rygge and Stansted in October.
Ryanair makes fresh attack over airport fees
Ryanair said it was cutting Stansted winter capacity because BAA had rejected its demand for deep cuts in airport 
charges and in protest at the UK government's plan to raise air passenger duty from £10 to £11 per departing 
passenger in November.
Mr O'Leary said: "Gordon Brown's £10 tourist tax and the BAA monopoly's high airport charges are damaging 
London and UK tourism and the British economy generally".
But Stewart Wingate, managing director of Stansted, said the Ryanair announcement meant it was "business as 
usual".
"Last winter Ryanair reduced its aircraft fleet here to 28 (from 36 the previous winter), this year it will be 24. It is 
common practice for them to reduce frequency to various destinations during the winter season as they have done 
in previous years."
In July last year, the Irish carrier warned its passenger traffic at Stansted would drop by 900,000 passengers in the 
winter of 2008-09, but BAA said the fall had been about 400,000.
The airline industry is highly seasonal and most airlines in the northern hemisphere, including Ryanair, routinely 
operate significantly fewer aircraft in the winter than in the summer, using the winter months to conduct essential 
maintenance work, when demand is lower.
BAA said Ryanair passenger numbers at Stansted fell by2 per cent in the 12 months to the end of March from 15m 
a year earlier to 14.7m. It forecast a fall in Ryanair passengers next winter.

Aer Lingus names Mueller as new chief

Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, has made a surprise choice for its new chief executive, appointing Christoph Mueller to 
replace Dermot Mannion, who announced his resignation in April.
The 47-year-old Mr Mueller, who will start in October, has extensive experience across the aviation sector, having 
worked for Daimler Benz Aerospace, Lufthansa, Belgian carrier Sabena, and the international courier group DHL.
"Christoph has the experience and the skill-set to lead the Aer Lingus team through what is an unprecedented 
operating environment and to make the changes that are required at Aer Lingus," said Colin Barrington, chairman 
of Aer Lingus.
From 2006, he was aviation director at TUI Travel, the tour operator, which also owns seven small airlines in 
northern Europe, including Arkefly in the Netherlands, Thomsonfly in the UK, Tuifly in Germany and Corsairfly in 
France. In total, the aviation division operated 160 short-haul and long-haul aircraft.
"I would view it positively," said Neil Glynn of NCB Stockbrokers.
"He has a stellar CV and has managed a bigger combined fleet than Aer Lingus. It's also a little bit surprising, since 
his name hadn't been mentioned before in terms of who was in the frame for the job."
Mr Mueller edged out Brian Dunne, the favourite for the job, who was formerly chief financial officer of Aer Lingus, 
and now chief financial officer of Canada's Ace Aviation Holdings. Other rumoured successors to Mr Mannion 
included Seán Coyle, Aer Lingus's current chief financial officer; or even Mr Barrington.
Aer Lingus names Mueller as new chief
Under Mr Mannion, who joined Aer Lingus four years ago from Emirates, Aer Lingus fought off two bid attempts by 
rival Ryanair, with the help of the Irish state, which still owns a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
However, Mr Mueller's biggest challenge on taking up the new role will be to see through the restructuring of the 
group, which last year made a pre-tax loss of EUR119.7m (£111m) as the global recession crimped demand for air 
travel, particularly in the carrier's long-haul flights to America.
Aer Lingus's share price has tumbled by 67 per cent since the start of this year, and the group is also trying to trim 
capital expenditure by conducting a review of its orders from Airbus, hoping to replacing long-haul aircraft orders 
with short-haul airplanes.
Shares in Aer Lingus rose 3.8 per cent 55 cents on Friday.

Ryanair increased its passenger numbers by 13 per cent year-on-year in June to 5.8m, setting a new monthly 
record as it continues to increase capacity and to add new aircraft to its fleet.
The Irish low cost carrier has become Europe's biggest short-haul airline measured by passenger numbers and is 
continuing to grow rapidly during the depth of the recession in strong contrast to most of its rivals.
It has the lowest cost base of any European carrier, which is allowing it to continue discounting fares heavily and to 
gain market share, as more travellers trade down from the higher fare legacy airlines.
The airline carried 60.2m passengers in the 12 months to the end of June and said it was "on course" to increase its 
passenger numbers in the current financial year to March 2010 to 67m from 58m last year.
By contrast British Airways said its short-haul passenger numbers in June in the UK and the rest of Europe fell by 
5.8 per cent year-on-year to 1.81m. Its total passenger numbers last month worldwide fell by 4.9 per cent to 2.93m.
Ryanair is continuing to expand its presence around Europe and said it was opening its 33rd operating base at 
Porto, in northern Portugal. It is basing two aircraft at Porto and is adding four new routes between Porto and Basel, 
Eindhoven, St. Etienne and Tours, bringing the network of services to and from Porto to 16.
It is also doubling capacity on its Porto to Paris-Beauvais route to twice-daily flights and said it expected its traffic to 
and from Porto to rise to 1.5m passengers in a full year.

Ryanair has a strange obsession with comparing itself with British Airways.
The Irish low-cost carrier has happily adopted BA's former slogan: "The world's favourite airline". On Monday it 
combined use of the slogan with the claim "Ryanair: now twice the size of British Airways". By some measures, the 
latter is true, by others it very much is not. It could just as well have said "Ryanair: quarter the size of British 
Airways".
Comparing the size of airlines is much like buying an airline ticket: you pay your money and you take your choice.
"The World's Favourite Airline" was created by Saatchi & Saatchi and first used by BA in 1983, as it was preparing 
for privatisation. It was always a questionable claim. For BA then, and for Ryanair now.
BA based the claim on the fact it carried more international passengers than any other airline. That conveniently 
ignored the reality that several airlines, chiefly in the US, were much bigger than BA but derived the bulk of their 
passengers from their domestic market rather than from international routes.
The fact that the domestic US market was a large part of a continent, compared with the domestic UK market which 
was confined to a collection of islands off the coast of mainland Europe, was also overlooked.
It was as if an international passenger flying from London to Brussels (distance 319kms) was somehow worth more 
than a domestic passenger flying from New York to Los Angeles (3,933kms).
BA's descent down most league tables of airline size meant it had to abandon the slogan a decade ago. Ryanair is 
using the same questionable basis for its claim to have become "the world's favourite airline". In the latest annual 
Airline publicity 'dogfight' hides reality
statistics from the International Air Transport Association, Ryanair does top one table, namely for the highest 
number of international passengers in 2008 at 57.65m. It is just ahead of Air France-KLM at 56.32m and Lufthansa 
(including Swiss) at 54.87m.
Add in domestic passengers, however, and the picture changes. Measured by total passenger numbers Ryanair 
falls to eighth behind Delta Air Lines (including Northwest Airlines), Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, Air 
France-KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss, United Airlines and China Southern Airlines. BA ranked 17th.
In the past 12 months Ryanair has become the biggest European short-haul carrier measured by passenger 
numbers. It is also one of the world's fastest-growing airlines.
In June Ryanair increased its passenger numbers by 13 per cent year-on-year to 5.8m, setting a new monthly 
record. By contrast British Airways' short-haul passenger numbers in June in the UK and the rest of Europe fell by 
5.8 per cent year-on-year to 1.81m. Its total passenger numbers worldwide fell by 4.9 per cent to 2.9m.
But the yardstick of passenger numbers, a Ryanair favourite, is less than perfect. It measures neither how far the 
passenger is carried and therefore the relative complexity of the operation, nor the revenue generated by the 
passenger.
Ryanair operates only on point-to-point, short-haul routes. BA is a network carrier with a long-haul network 
spanning the globe.
The more relevant and fairer yardsticks for BA are turnover and revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs), which 
represents the number of fare-paying passengers multiplied by the distances they fly.
In the year to the end of March BA had a turnover of £8.99bn, while Ryanair had a turnover in the same period of 
EUR2.94bn (£2.53bn), making the Irish carrier less than 30 per cent the size of BA.
Both are dwarfed by the real giants of the industry. The top spot varies with exchange rate volatility but has Delta 
Air Lines (including Northwest Airlines) at a pro-forma $34.2bn (£21bn) in 2008 vying with the Lufthansa group at 
EUR24.9bn.
On the basis of passenger traffic, measured by revenue passenger kilometres, Delta was the pro-forma world 
leader in 2008 at 285bn (including Northwest), followed by American at 212bn and Air France-KLM at 209bn. On 
this measurement BA was eighth in the world at 115.7bn and Ryanair was back in 18th place at 62bn.
If it is down to investors' assessments, a third picture emerges.
Based on market capitalisation, Singapore Airlines leads at $10.5bn, but Ryanair is in second place at $6.7bn as it 
performs robustly through the recession.
It is the most valuable European airline ahead of Lufthansa at $5.6bn, and by this measure it certainly is "Now twice 
the size of British Airways", which languishes at $2.4bn.

European small-cap stocks are often ignored as they can be difficult to sell in a downturn, but being overlooked can 
be helpful for investors looking for long-term returns in the sector.
Around 3,000 to 4,000 companies with a market capitalisation of less than EUR3.5bn (£3bn) are listed on 
continental European exchanges. And because analysts often fail to assess their prospects with vigour, some 
attract scant attention. As a result, their valuations tend to be reasonable.
"Inefficiencies in the small-cap market have been increasing for some time as fewer and fewer analysts have been 
deployed to cover this area," says Nick Williams, manager of Baring's £214.1m European Select trust.
"And despite market volatility, a significant proportion of Europe's smaller companies have come out with results 
that have exceeded overly-negative expectations. There may be some profit-taking in the near-term but we think 
there are some excellent long-term opportunities."
Since January, the European small-cap sector has enjoyed a strong run, reporting a 19 per cent return against a 
gain of 1.3 per cent by the wider European market, according to Morningstar.
UK-listed European small-cap funds are up 9.8 per cent on average over the period - with particularly robust 
performances recorded by Baillie Gifford European Small cap fund (up 21.1 per cent); Ignis's European smaller 
companies fund (+15.49 per cent); and Insight Investment's European smaller companies fund (up 16.8 per cent).
Favoured holdings vary widely by industry, country and popularity and range from Turkish Airlines to Irish Life and 
Permanent,Ryanair, Wire Card, a German online payments group, and Jumbo, the Greek toy retailer.
Europe's smaller companies punch above their weight
Liquidity poses concern. While outperformance is more likely to be achieved by the sector, so too is 
underperformance. Looking for protection against balance sheet erosion and sharp share price falls, a number of 
small-cap managers choose to keep large, diversified portfolios of, say, 90 to 110 stocks.
"Smaller companies are more vulnerable to events than larger ones," reports Andy Lynch, who heads Schroders' 
European dynamic growth fund, which has a 20 per cent allocation to small caps.
"If the CEO of Vodafone gets run over by a bus, a strong management team will be able to step up and continue 
the company's successful path, but management changes and other business problems are more difficult at a 
smaller company."
Lynch is overweight in healthcare, energy and utilities, but also holds stakes in Azimut, the Italian fund management 
group, Rosenbauer, the Austrian fire-engine maker with a "sound balance sheet", as well as Acino, the Swiss drug 
maker.
He chooses not to hedge against sterling's rise against the euro though his currency exposure extends to the euro, 
Swiss franc, Norwegian and Danish krone and Swedish krona. "I found my ability to forecast currency movements 
is atrocious, so I just don't worry about it," he says.
Philip Dicken, who oversees both Threadneedle's pan-European £115m small- cap fund and its £570m small-cap 
European fund which excludes UK holdings, claims that UK small caps hold appeal as they tend to be more liquid 
than European stocks.
When investing in Europe, Dicken prefers industrial groups with considerable market share to financials. "Barriers 
to entry give companies pricing power," he explains. Two German picks are the optician Fielmann and Stratec 
Biomedical. "Fielmann has about 50 per cent of the market share for the sale of glasses and contact lenses in 
Germany, but they are the lowest-cost provider. It's a well-managed company," he points out.
A bout of overselling has narrowed the gap between the valuations of the continent's large and small caps and 
some fund managers running money across the wider European market have not restocked their portfolios with 
small caps since 2007 when holdings of smaller companies were slashed as they grew more expensive. Concerned 
about liquidity, just four of the 50 stocks in the portfolio of Kevin Lilley - manager of Royal London's European 
growth trust are small caps, for example.
"When I'm very positive, I have 20 to 25 per cent of my fund in small caps. I'd rather have a large proportion in large 
caps because with small caps, you have a liquidity issue. If I try to sell a similar size position in small caps, it can 
take a week," Lilley reports.
But given the recent poor performance of European large caps, views on the appropriate spread between the 
continent's bantam and heavyweight classes vary. The 15 per cent fall in the value of the euro against sterling hit 
investment trusts sharply in the first six months of the year. And a number of those invested in European large caps 
performed poorly. Among those reporting the worst falls were Gartmore European (which lost 15 per cent), 
BlackRock's Greater Europe trust (down 13 per cent) and Fidelity's European Values (off 10 per cent), according to 
Oriel Securities.
By comparison, the performance of small caps was far better. Defying the expectations of analysts who predicted 
Europe's small-cap sector would underperform in the first quarter, a number of companies reported results that 
exceeded estimates, according to Williams of Baring. This performance, coupled with the dearth of research by 
analysts, throws up opportunities for patient stockpickers who are willing to sift through the market.
"Institutional buyers often take a more cautious approach to liquidity than they need to," concludes Williams.

Ryanair plans to stop passengers checking in baggage next year but will allow two or more pieces of carry-on 
luggage, as it steps up its drive to reduce airport handling costs.
The Irish carrier, the biggest short-haul airline in Europe by number of passengers, is making radical changes to 
airport check-in procedures, which could eventually force other airlines to follow its lead for short-haul, point-to-point 
flights, as it reinforces its competitive position as the lowest-cost and lowest-fare carrier in Europe.
From the beginning of October Ryanair is already to abolish conventional check-in facilities at airports across its 
European network, the first carrier to make such a move, forcing all passengers to check in online before leaving 
home or office.
From October the airline will still allow baggage to be checked in for the hold but will make significant charges for 
the "service".
But Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said on Tuesday the airline was planning a further stage next year when it 
would allow no checked-in baggage but passengers would be allowed to carry more bags through security - two or 
more according to airport rules - to the aircraft.
They would still be allowed to carry only one bag into the cabin - maximum weight 10kg - but Mr O'Leary said a 
second bag could be left beside the aircraft to be loaded on and picked up on arrival.
Such procedures are already commonplace in the US for travellers flying on regional jet feeder services to main 
hub airports.
Ryanair to end airport baggage check-in
Mr O'Leary has already been successful in changing the travel habits of many passengers by introducing ever 
heavier baggage charges to persuade passengers to travel only with ­carry­on baggage. Only 30 per cent of 
Ryanair passengers now check in baggage for the hold, compared with 80 per cent two years ago.
In pushing through the changes, Mr O'Leary is gambling that the attraction of the lowest fares will keep passengers 
coming.
The airline is aiming to increase its passenger numbers from 58m last year to 67m in the current financial year to 
the end of March 2010, and is one of the few airlines in Europe that is continuing to grow.
But Mr O'Leary warned that it was planning to freeze growth at its nine UK bases, partly as a protest against the 
further increases being introduced by the government in air passenger duty. He forecast that the number of Ryanair 
passengers carried to and from UK airports would fall in this financial year to 32m from 34m last year, the first such 
decline, partly because of the impact of rising aviation taxation.
The Netherlands had scrapped a similar tax because of its impact on tourism, Belgium had withdrawn plans for 
such a levy and Greece and Spain were taking steps to cut airport changes but the UK and Ireland were pressing 
ahead with increases in these "suicide" taxes, he said.
"Tourism is one of the UK's most important industries and employers. It responds quickly to price changes," said Mr 
O'Leary.
"The government's £10 tourist tax is making the UK an uncompetitive destination and they must scrap this tax now 
to prevent a further collapse of UK passenger, tourism and job numbers.
"While the UK keeps taxing tourists Ryanair will switch its growth to other EU countries where low-cost airports are 
growing and where governments are welcoming tourists not taxing them," he said.

Wizz Air, the leading low-cost airline in central and eastern Europe, is to place an order for 50 short-haul jets from 
Airbus, as it seeks to become one of the leading budget airlines in Europe, reports Kevin Done.
The group, which began flying in May 2004, has 26 Airbus A320s in its fleet. The latest purchase, agreed in a 
memorandum of understanding signed on Thursday, will take its total orders from the European aircraft maker to 
132.
The agreement, which is expected to become a firm order within days, has a value of $3.8bn at list prices before 
discounts. Airbus has eclipsed its rival Boeing at the Paris air show this week. In spite of the recession and the 
caution shown by many global carriers, the European aircraft maker has secured firm orders or letters of intent for 
more than 100 jets this week.
They are chiefly for short-haul aircraft, including 24 for Qatar Airways and 16 for Vietnam Airlines. The only 
significant order for widebody jets has been placed by AirAsia X, the world's pioneering long-haul, low-cost airline, 
which has ordered 10 400-seat Airbus A350-900s. Wizz Air is continuing to expand quickly in similar fashion to 
Ireland's Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, in spite of the deep recession in the air travel market.
The low-cost airline business model is proving much more robust in the downturn than the operations of the 
traditional network carriers. Both Wizz Air, which has its headquarters in Budapest, and Ryanair are continuing to 
add capacity and expand their fleets. In contrast, rival full service airlines such as British Airways, Air France-KLM 
and Lufthansa have announced capacity cuts.
Wizz Air has already established a network of 11 operating bases in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine 
and the Czech Republic as it expands through the region with a network of more than 130 routes. Jozsef Varadi, 
the airline's chief executive, said the group was planning to expand its passenger numbers this year by around 27

per cent from 5.9m last year to 7.5m. The main shareholder in Wizz Air is Indigo Partners, the US private equity 
fund led by Bill Franke, which is also a founding investor in the Singapore-based low-cost carrier Tiger Airways.

British Airways' premium passenger traffic fell sharply in May, as lucrative business travellers continue to desert in 
large numbers from the UK flag carrier as well as from many of the world's other leading long-haul carriers.
The global economic recession has taken a particularly heavy toll of premium long-haul air travel, as corporations 
and financial institutions either cut their travel budgets or insist on personnel trading down to the cheaper cabins.
BA said Wednesday its premium traffic had fallen 17.2 per cent year-on-year in May following a fall of 17.7 per cent 
in April. Volumes of premium traffic, where BA traditionally generates the bulk of its profits, have been falling steeply 
year-on-year since September, but the rate of decline has accelerated in the past couple of months.
The airline said market conditions were unchanged with premium volumes under pressure and average fare levels 
under pressure in all cabins.
Some low-cost carriers operating only in short-haul markets are performing more strongly than the legacy full 
service airlines helped in part by passengers trading down. Ireland's Ryanair, which is continuing to add capacity 
and to open new routes, said Wednesday its passenger numbers had risen 9 per cent year-on-year in May to 5.5m.
BA short-haul passenger numbers in the UK and the rest of Europe fell by 7.8 per cent in May to 1.74m, and its 
total passenger numbers fell by 7.3 per cent to 2.76m.
Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, warned the airline's 41,000 staff last week the group was "in a fight for survival".
It is in difficult negotiations with its trades unions on measures to cut costs and improve productivity and recently 
disclosed a record pre-tax loss for the 12 months to the end of March of £401m.
British Airways business traffic falls sharply
BA said its non-premium traffic had fallen last month 4.2 per cent.
The airline is cutting its flying programme to try to reduce the number of unfilled seats and said its capacity, 
measured by available seat kilometres, was 5.3 per cent lower in May than a year ago. Its overall traffic, measured 
by revenue passenger kilometres, fell faster by 6.5 per cent.
Overall it is cutting capacity by 2.5 per cent during the summer months, but the main reductions are before and after 
the peak summer holiday weeks. It is planning a deeper cut in capacity by 4 per cent in the next winter season, with 
the grounding of 16 aircraft following a cut in capacity of 3.1 per cent last winter.

Shares in Swedish banks fell sharply on Wednesday after Latvia failed to sell 50m Latvian lats ($100.7m) worth of 
treasury bills, raising fears of a possible devaluation of Latvia's currency.
Swedbankand SEB are heavily exposed to the Baltic region, which has been particularly hard hit by the global 
recession. Latvia, one of the three Baltic states, has tapped the International Monetary Fund for emergency aid.
Exposure to the Baltic region accounts for 12 per cent of SEB's and 16 per cent of Swedbank's loan books, 
according to Ben May at Capital Economics. Both Swedbank and SEB have launched rights issues in the last year 
in the face of mounting Baltic region losses.
Mr May said: "While the impact of [a Latvian] devaluation on the Swedish banking system may be exaggerated, 
rising bad loans at home and abroad mean that a further tightening in Swedish credit conditions is inevitable."
Swedbank fell 15.9 per cent to SKr38.00 yesterday, following a 5.6 per cent drop on Tuesday. Shares in Sweden's 
fourth largest bank have fallen 68.6 per cent in the past year.
SEB was the largest faller on the FTSE Eurofirst 300. Sweden's third largest bank by market capitalisation fell 11 
per cent to SKr30.00, adding to losses of 3.4 per cent on Tuesday.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 2 per cent to 868.1. Germany's Xetra Dax was down 1.7 per cent to 5,054.53 while 
France's CAC 40 fell 2 per cent to 3,309.65.
Banks were lower as traders said the large demand for capital raising for banks in the UK, US and throughout 
Europe had halted the gains banking stocks have made in the last few months.
Swedish banks hurt by Latvian concerns
"Banks have had such a good run recently from their lows and now investors may be asking if it was too far, too 
fast," a trader said. "Now that volumes are very light, they are reacting more than they might do otherwise."
Spain's Banco Santander fell 2.8 per cent to EUR7.53 and BBVAlost 3.4 per cent to EUR8.54. Italy's Banco 
Popolarewas down 4 per cent to EUR5.66.
In Germany, Deutsche Bank fell 3.9 per cent to EUR46.41 and Commerzbankfell 2.5 per cent to EUR5.50. DnB 
NOR, Norway's largest bank by market value, lost 8.15 per cent to NKr53.00
Bucking the trend, Dexiarose 6.9 per cent to EUR5.40 building on an 11.9 per cent gain in the previous session.
Ryanair gained 4.6 per cent to EUR3.70. Royal Bank of Scotland raised Ryanair's price target from EUR4 to 
EUR4.25 with a "buy"rating.
The Irish low-cost airline announced yesterday that passenger numbers rose by 9 per cent from a year ago, after 
reporting its first loss in 20 years on Tuesday.
ArcelorMittal was down 5.3 per cent to EUR24.07. The world's largest steelmaker announced a deal with Spain's 
government to allow temporary lay-offs among its 12,000 Spanish employees.
The Luxembourg-based company has been hit by falling global demand for steel and has cut production by as 
much as 50 per cent
Arcandorfell 0.5 per cent to EUR1.98 following a decision by the European Commission that state aid to the 
troubled German retailer must be approved by the European Union. The commission said Arcandor does not qualify 
for aid under rules dealing with the financial crisis and instead must apply using normal rescue and restructuring 
guidelines.
Shares in Porschefell 0.9 per cent to EUR45.69 after the carmaker said it had asked the German government for a 
EUR1.75bn loan.

Airline stocks were in focus on European equities markets on Tuesday, after news of sharply lower profits at 
Ryanair pressured its shares.
Overall, major indices cooled as investors took profits from the previous session's highs. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 
index was little changed at 886.15 by mid-morning.  The benchmark European index hits its highest level since 
early January on Monday, rising 2.6 per cent on the day.
The CAC 40 in Paris held steady at 3,377.55 and Germany's Xetra Dax was unchanged at 5,152.69.
Ireland's Ryanair fell 3.58 per cent to EUR3.50 on news that the leading European low cost airline fell into loss last 
year after its attempts to take over Aer Lingus, its national rival. Underlying profits were also hit by high fuel prices 
early last year.
As Ryanair said it remained interest in a potential acquisition of its compatriot, Aer Lingus shares rose 7.38 per cent 
to EUR0.698.
Eurozone unemployment hit a 10-year high according to data release on Tuesday. The region's jobless rate rose 
from 8.9 per cent in March to 9.2 per cent in April, emphasising the depth of the recession in European economies.
In Germany, the troubled Hypo Real Estate awaited shareholder approval to back a proposal for nationalisation, 
where the German government would hold up to 90 per cent of the company. The government is currently controls 
more than 47 per cent of the bank.
Its shares fell 0.66 per cent on Tuesday to EUR1.50, having lost 93.26 per cent over the past year.

Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus was a case of folie de grandeur. Were it not for the EUR223m write-off on the value of 
its almost 30 per cent Aer Lingus stake, Ryanair would have turned a profit last year. Meanwhile, most other 
European airlines have been losing money hand over fist, leaving Ryanair the continent's biggest by market value.
This has become the latest boasting point of Michael O'Leary, chief executive, who has long used Ryanair's 
low­cost platform to berate just about everyone else. This has included "clueless" regulators; passengers who balk 
at being treated like cattle but still keep coming back; and competitors, the latest being Lufthansa after a particularly 
grandiose suggestion from Mr O'Leary that he could almost buy the German carrier "for cash".
Yet this grandstanding has always been just a marketing tool to highlight the growth and ruthless cost-cutting of 
Ryanair. While other airlines are shrinking capacity in the downturn, he is increasing the size of Ryanair's fleet by 
15 per cent. With some 90 per cent of the coming year's fuel bill hedged at $62 a barrel, Mr O'Leary's forecast rise 
in net profit to EUR300m for the coming year looks conservative, especially as it factors in a 15 to 20 per cent drop 
in passenger yields.
"Low cost always wins," as Mr O'Leary says, and it is telling that he increasingly compares Ryanair with other 
budget-conscious companies, such as Ikea, rather than airlines. Nonetheless, his model remains Southwest, the 
US domestic carrier. It began low cost operations 20 years before Ryanair, serving a market half the size, building a 
fleet now more than twice as big. Southwest's growth has only lately reached its limits. Mr O'Leary will be able to 
boast for years yet.

Ryanair, the leading European low cost airline, fell into loss last year under the impact of its abortive attempts to 
take over Aer Lingus, its smaller local rival.
Underlying profits also fell heavily, as it was hit by the surge in the fuel price in the first half of last year and by 
mistimed fuel hedging moves. The share price fell more than 4 per cent in early Dublin trading before recovering 
somewhat to stand 1.3 per cent lower at EUR3.56 in afternoon dealings.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, forecast that underlying profits would more than double this year, 
however, in stark contrast to expected continuing losses at several leading European network carriers including 
British Airways and Air France-KLM.
He said, however, the profit forecast carried a "heavy health warning."
The Irish carrier, the biggest European airline by market capitalisation, is one of the few European airlines that is 
continuing to grow rapidly during the recession, while most of the airline industry is cutting capacity.
Mr O'Leary forecast a 15 per cent rise in passenger volumes in the 12 months to the end of March 2010 to 67m and 
said the group expected to "at least double" its underlying net profits to a range of EUR200m to EUR300m.
The plunge in the Aer Lingus share price forced Ryanair to take a EUR222.5m write-off on the value of its 29.8 per 
cent stake, which helped to transform its already much reduced operating profit of EUR144m, before exceptional 
charges, to a pre-tax loss of EUR180.5m, down from a pre-tax profit of EUR438.9m a year earlier.
Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus wipes out profit
Excluding the Aer Lingus impairment charges and a EUR51.6m accelerated depreciation charge for the sale of 
older aircraft, the group said on Tuesday its underlying net profit had fallen by 78 per cent in the year to the end of 
March from EUR480.9m to EUR105m. The result was ahead of its previous guidance.
Ryanair, the largest European short-haul carrier measured by passenger numbers, said its turnover last year had 
increased by 8 per cent from EUR2.7bn to EUR2.9bn, while passenger numbers rose by 15 per cent from 50.9m to 
58.5m. Its average fares were reduced by 8 per cent to EUR40.
Mr O'Leary said the significantly lower oil prices in recent months had encouraged the group to restart hedging and 
it was now 90 per cent hedged for the first three quarters of the coming year "at much lower prices than 
competitors" at around $620 a tonne.
If oil prices remained at current levels he forecast a EUR450m fall in the airline's full year fuel bill. Last year its fuel 
bill jumped by 59 per cent or EUR499m to EUR1.26bn.
Ryanair also forecast a fall of around 5 per cent in non-fuel operating costs per passenger, which would be used to 
lower fares "materially."
Mr O'Leary said the lower fares would help the group to expand its traffic and fill more seats, as its capacity 
continued to grow. Despite the deep recession the group was gaining market share from "high fare competitors."
"While we have limited visibility on bookings we expect that a combination of a deep recession, weaker sterling and 
our own capacity growth will cause average fares to fall by between 15 and 20 per cent this year to as little as 
EUR32 per passenger," he said.
"At a time when all of our competitors are suffering increasing costs, Ryanair uniquely is reducing unit costs in the 
current year," said Mr O'Leary. He compared  its performance to groups like Aldi, Lidl, Ikea and McDonalds.
The dramatic traffic declines, stalled growth, and increased losses being suffered by many of its competitors would 
"inevitably lead to further consolidation and fewer players at the end of this recession," he said.
Last year Ryanair added 18 net new aircraft to its fleet, which totalled 181 at the end of March. It operates a single 
type fleet of 189-seat Boeing 737-800s. It added six new bases to a network of more than 30 at Alghero, 
Birmingham, Bologna, Bournemouth, Cagliari, and Edinburgh.
It has been successful in raising its ancillary revenues, from sources such as commission earnings on its website 
from hotel, car rental and travel insurance bookings. Ancillary earnings rose by 23 per cent last year and for the first 
time accounted for 20 per cent of total turnover.
Mr O'Leary said inflight mobile phone services were now available on more than 40 aircraft and said the group 
believed inflight communications would make "a meaningful contribution to ancillary profit growth in future years if 
this trial proves successful."

however, in stark contrast to expected continuing losses at several leading European network carriers including 
British Airways and Air France-KLM.
He said, however, the profit forecast carried a "heavy health warning."
The Irish carrier, the biggest European airline by market capitalisation, is one of the few European airlines that is 
continuing to grow rapidly during the recession, while most of the airline industry is cutting capacity.
Mr O'Leary forecast a 15 per cent rise in passenger volumes in the 12 months to the end of March 2010 to 67m and 
said the group expected to "at least double" its underlying net profits to a range of EUR200m to EUR300m.
The plunge in the Aer Lingus share price forced Ryanair to take a EUR222.5m write-off on the value of its 29.8 per 
cent stake, which helped to transform its already much reduced operating profit of EUR144m, before exceptional 
charges, to a pre-tax loss of EUR180.5m, down from a pre-tax profit of EUR438.9m a year earlier.
Ryanair attempt to buy rival wipes out profit
Excluding the Aer Lingus impairment charges and a EUR51.6m accelerated depreciation charge for the sale of 
older aircraft, the group said on Tuesday its underlying net profit had fallen by 78 per cent in the year to the end of 
March from EUR480.9m to EUR105m. The result was ahead of its previous guidance.
Ryanair, the largest European short-haul carrier measured by passenger numbers, said its turnover last year had 
increased by 8 per cent from EUR2.7bn to EUR2.9bn, while passenger numbers rose by 15 per cent from 50.9m to 
58.5m. Its average fares were reduced by 8 per cent to EUR40.
Mr O'Leary said the significantly lower oil prices in recent months had encouraged the group to restart hedging and 
it was now 90 per cent hedged for the first three quarters of the coming year "at much lower prices than 
competitors" at around $620 a tonne.
If oil prices remained at current levels he forecast a EUR450m fall in the airline's full year fuel bill. Last year its fuel 
bill jumped by 59 per cent or EUR499m to EUR1.26bn.
Ryanair also forecast a fall of around 5 per cent in non-fuel operating costs per passenger, which would be used to 
lower fares "materially."
Mr O'Leary said the lower fares would help the group to expand its traffic and fill more seats, as its capacity 
continued to grow. Despite the deep recession the group was gaining market share from "high fare competitors."
"While we have limited visibility on bookings we expect that a combination of a deep recession, weaker sterling and 
our own capacity growth will cause average fares to fall by between 15 and 20 per cent this year to as little as 
EUR32 per passenger," he said.
"At a time when all of our competitors are suffering increasing costs, Ryanair uniquely is reducing unit costs in the 
current year," said Mr O'Leary. He compared  its performance to groups like Aldi, Lidl, Ikea and McDonalds.
The dramatic traffic declines, stalled growth, and increased losses being suffered by many of its competitors would 
"inevitably lead to further consolidation and fewer players at the end of this recession," he said.
Last year Ryanair added 18 net new aircraft to its fleet, which totalled 181 at the end of March. It operates a single 
type fleet of 189-seat Boeing 737-800s. It added six new bases to a network of more than 30 at Alghero, 
Birmingham, Bologna, Bournemouth, Cagliari, and Edinburgh.
It has been successful in raising its ancillary revenues, from sources such as commission earnings on its website 
from hotel, car rental and travel insurance bookings. Ancillary earnings rose by 23 per cent last year and for the first 
time accounted for 20 per cent of total turnover.
Mr O'Leary said inflight mobile phone services were now available on more than 40 aircraft and said the group 
believed inflight communications would make "a meaningful contribution to ancillary profit growth in future years if 
this trial proves successful."

So far the recession has been good for Ryanair and its iconoclastic leader Michael O'Leary.
In the space of 15 years as chief executive, he has taken a small lossmaking airline from the fringes of Europe and 
has built it into the world's second most valuable carrier by market capitalisation, after Singapore Airlines.
In the past 12 months it has overtaken both Air France KLM and Germany's Lufthansa - British Airways was left in 
the slipstream long ago - to become the biggest European short-haul carrier, measured by passenger numbers. 
And in the depth of the recession, it is stretching its lead.
As most carriers in Europe cut capacity, Ryanair is still adding more aircraft, confident that with the lowest costs in 
the industry it can continue to drive down fares, gaining market share to fill its rising number of seats.
The results for the financial year to the end of March, reported on Tuesday, were ravaged by the surge in the oil 
price early last year, and the plunge in Ryanair's financial performance was exacerbated by its own mistimed fuel 
hedging.
It ended the financial year with its first net loss since flotation in 1997 as a result of writedowns on its 29.8 per cent 
stake in Aer Lingus, bought as part of its abortive takeover attempts in the past two years.
Mr O'Leary is hardly infallible. He paid a total of EUR407m for the Aer Lingus stake and, following a EUR222m 
writedown with these results, it is now worth just EUR93m (£80.7m).
O'Leary looks to skies as he keeps throttle open
But Ryanair's low-cost airline business model is again demonstrating it can develop robustly during recession. Even 
with a 59 per cent rise in fuel costs last year and an 8 per cent drop in average fares, the group stayed in profit at 
an underlying level.
To the discomfiture of rivals Mr O'Leary is keeping the throttle open. Ryanair has led the low-cost airline revolution 
in Europe. It did not invent the model, which originated in the US with Southwest Airlines, but it has implemented it 
with unmatched zeal and discipline.
The immediate outlook is promising. Mr O'Leary forecast on Tuesday that underlying net profits would at least 
double to between EUR200m and EUR300m this year. The flipside of having made bad hedging decisions in the 
previous two years is that Ryanair was free to lock in relatively low fuel prices for much of the current financial year, 
when the oil price plunged in recent months.
Mr O'Leary is also still driving down non-fuel costs as he squeezes airport and handling costs around Europe, and 
he has locked in reduced prices for acquiring new aircraft thanks to the strength of the euro against the dollar.
With one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, Ryanair has also secured financing for new aircraft to 
September 2010.
While many airline chief executives claim they are fighting for survival in the worst trading conditions they have ever 
faced, Mr O'Leary was confidently sticking to pre-recession forecasts that Ryanair would double its profits and 
passenger numbers between 2007 and 2012.
He has also scheduled talks with Boeing for the late summer on another big aircraft order for 200-300 jets for 
delivery between 2013 and 2016.
According to a leading aviation analyst Ryanair still has scope for growth under the Southwest model.
Liberalisation of the US domestic airline industry happened almost 20 years earlier than in Europe. The US carrier 
has a fleet of more than 500 Boeing 737s and handles more than 100m passengers a year
Ryanair as yet is only half the size and the European market has a population of 500m. "It has a lot of runway 
ahead of it," says the analyst.

Ryanair, the leading European low-cost airline, fell into loss last year, its first deficit since flotation 12 years ago, 
under the impact of its abortive attempts to take over Aer Lingus, its smaller local rival.
Its underlying profits also fell heavily, as it was hit by the surge in the fuel price in the first half of last year and by 
mistimed fuel hedging moves.
However, chief executive Michael O'Leary forecast that underlying profits would more than double this year, in stark 
contrast to expected losses at several leading European network carriers including British Airways and Air France-
KLM.
The Irish carrier is one of the few European airlines that is continuing to grow strongly during the recession, while 
most of the industry cuts capacity.
Mr O'Leary forecast a 15 per cent rise in passenger volumes in the 12 months to the end of March 2010 to 67m and 
said the group expected to "at least double" its underlying net profits to a range of EUR200m (£173m) to EUR300m.
Its share price closed 9 cents, or 2.5 per cent, lower at EUR3.54 after a 23 per cent rise in the past three months.
The plunge in the Aer Lingus share price during the past year forced Ryanair to take a EUR222.5m write down on 
the value of its 29.8 per cent stake, which helped to transform an operating profit of EUR144m, before exceptional 
charges, to a pre-tax loss of EUR180.5m, down from a pre-tax profit of EUR438.9m a year earlier.
Excluding the Aer Lingus impairment charges and a EUR51.6m accelerated depreciation charge for the sale of 
older aircraft, underlying net profits fell 78 per cent, from EUR480.9m to EUR105m.

Turnover increased 8 per cent from EUR2.71bn to EUR2.94bn, while passenger numbers rose 15 per cent from 
50.9m to 58.5m.
Average fares fell 8 per cent to EUR40 last year and Mr O'Leary forecast a further steep decline this year by 15 to 
20 per cent to about EUR32.
Ryanair has taken advantage of significantly lower oil prices to restart hedging, and said it was 90 per cent hedged 
for the first three quarters of the coming year "at much lower prices than competitors" at about $620 a tonne.
Mr O'Leary said he expected a EUR450m fall in the full-year fuel bill, which last year jumped 59 per cent, or 
EUR499m, to EUR1.3bn.
Ryanair raised its ancillary revenues, from sources such as commission earnings from hotel, car rental and travel 
insurance bookings, by 23 per cent.

Barclays shares led London equities lower on Tuesday, hit by confirmation of the sale of a significant stake in the 
bank by its main Middle Eastern investor.
International Petroleum Investment Corp, an investment vehicle of the Abu Dhabi royal family, was finalising a 
placing of 1.3bn Barclays shares with institutional investors. The news came less than seven months after IPIC's 
controversial £3.5bn investment in Barclays , which upset existing institutional investors who were shut out of the 
deal. Brokers said the placing would be priced at 267p a share.
The group also invited offers for its entire £1.5bn holding of Barclays capital notes in a process that will be 
completed by Wednesday . Both sales are being handled by Credit Suisse. Barclays' stock fell 12.1 per cent in 
early exchanges to 278p.
"Given the stunning rally in Barclays it is understandable that speculators would want to book some profits, and I 
suppose IPIC would fall into that category," said David Morrison, market strategist at GFT.
"I've been calling an end to this rally since it started, so I'm close to giving up. I imagine there are plenty of others 
who feel the same way so once all the shorts go screaming for the exits, we should see a big turn in equities. It 
feels like we're getting there, but we will need some bad news as a catalyst."
In the rest of the banking sector, investors took a cue to book profits after the FTSE 100's recent strong run. HSBC 
fell 2.7 per cent to 537p. Lloyds Banking Group was 3 per cent weaker at 70.3p and Royal Bank of Scotland was 1 
per cent softer at 39.8p.
Barclays leads FTSE lower
Airline stocks were absorbing news of a loss of EUR169m at Ryanair after a writedown on the value of its stake in 
Ireland's flag carrier, Aer Lingus. Shares in the budget airline  lost 4.9 per cent to EUR3.45 in early Dublin trading.
"For all [Ryanair chief executive] Michael O'Leary's bluster, a loss is still a loss," said Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at 
ETX Capital. "However, Ryanair can point to the strategic stake taken in Aer Lingus and the generally troubled state 
of the airline industry, and claim that an underlying trading profit of EUR105m with predictions of yield increases as 
evidence that it is still one of the best run companies in the sector."
In the wider market, the FTSE 100's strong advance faded under the weight of the banking sector's losses. The 
benchmark index fell 42 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 4,466.50.  It had risen 2 per cent over the previous session to 
close over 4,500 points at its highest level since January 7.
Retail stocks were in demand after news of stronger-than-expected first quarter numbers from Kingfisher, the name 
behind the B&Q and Screwfix home improvement chains. Kingfisher said total group profit in the period rose 38.5 
per cent, helped by better weather and the later timing of the Easter public holiday. Its shares rose 9.1 per cent to 
200½p, the strongest performance on the top tier.
Signs of stronger spending on the high street brought a series of its most famous names onto the FTSE 100's 
leaderboard. The parent of the Homebase DIY chain, Home Retail Group, which also owns the Argos catalogue 
shops, rose 4.4 per cent to 252.8p. Marks & Spencer was 0.8 per cent higher at 287½p. Mid-cap stock music 
retailer HMV was 2.8 per cent higher at 128.5p.
Overall, London's second tier FTSE 250  index was 0.3 per cent weaker at 7,736.3, with retailers helping limit the 
downside from profit taking in investment companies.
Overnight in New York, major indices reached seven-month highs as further robust economic data helped the 
improving mood.  By the close in New York the S&P 500 index was up 2.6 per cent at 942.87 points, its highest 
close since November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.6 per cent to 8,721.44.
Asian equities also extended their rally, with Japanese export stocks helped by a weaker yen. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 
was 0.3 per cent higher at 9,704.31.
"Globally, we're seeing a lot of money flow into the resources and commodity space following yesterday's bullish 
data out of China. It's just a massive reweighting and re-rating of any commodity related assets. The world 
economy is certainly stabilising, with the turnround clearest in China," said Ben Potter, an analyst at IG Index.

In the rest of the banking sector, investors took a cue to book profits after the FTSE 100's recent strong run. HSBC 
fell 2.7 per cent to 537p. Lloyds Banking Group was 4.8 per cent weaker at 69p and Royal Bank of Scotland was 
3.2 per cent softer at 38.9p.

Airline stocks were absorbing news of a loss of EUR169m at Ryanair after a writedown on the value of its stake in 
Ireland's flag carrier, Aer Lingus. Shares in the budget airline  lost 4.9 per cent to EUR3.45 in early Dublin trading. 
Its peer EasyJet fell 0.6 per cent to 314.3p and UK flag carrier British Airways was 1.2 per cent lower at 154.9p.
"For all [Ryanair chief executive] Michael O'Leary's bluster, a loss is still a loss," said Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at 
ETX Capital. "However, Ryanair can point to the strategic stake taken in Aer Lingus and the generally troubled state 
of the airline industry, and claim that an underlying trading profit of EUR105m with predictions of yield increases as 
evidence that it is still one of the best run companies in the sector."
In the wider market, the FTSE 100's strong advance faded under the weight of the banking sector's losses. The 
benchmark index fell 56 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 4,449.0.  It had risen 2 per cent over the previous session to 
close over 4,500 points at its highest level since January 7.
Candover Investments tumbled 26 per cent to 172p as concern about its capital position lingered. The FT reported 
that the private equity group was considering a range of options to raise urgently-needed cash, including outright 
takeover, selling a minority stake, and tapping existing shareholders for more money via a rights issue.
Retail stocks were in demand after news of stronger-than-expected first quarter numbers from Kingfisher, the name 
behind the B&Q and Screwfix home improvement chains. Kingfisher said total group profit in the period rose 38.5 
per cent, helped by better weather and the later timing of the Easter public holiday. Its shares rose 6.1 per cent to 
195p, the strongest performance on the top tier.
Signs of stronger spending on the high street brought a series of its most famous names onto the FTSE 100's 
leaderboard. The parent of the Homebase DIY chain, Home Retail Group, which also owns the Argos catalogue 
shops, rose 4.1 per cent to 252p. Marks & Spencer was 1.8 per cent higher at 290.3p. Mid-cap stock music retailer 
HMV was 2.8 per cent higher at 128.5p.
Overall, London's second tier FTSE 250  index was 0.3 per cent weaker at 7,736.3, with retailers helping limit the 
downside from profit taking in investment companies.
Overnight in New York, major indices reached seven-month highs as further robust economic data helped the 
improving mood.  By the close in New York the S&P 500 index was up 2.6 per cent at 942.87 points, its highest 
close since November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.6 per cent to 8,721.44.
Asian equities also extended their rally, with Japanese export stocks helped by a weaker yen. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 
was 0.3 per cent higher at 9,704.31.
"Globally, we're seeing a lot of money flow into the resources and commodity space following yesterday's bullish 
data out of China. It's just a massive reweighting and re-rating of any commodity related assets. The world 
economy is certainly stabilising, with the turnround clearest in China," said Ben Potter, an analyst at IG Markets.

Swedish banks were lower on Tuesday following forecasts by the country's central bank that the nation's financial 
sector would be hit by a rising tide of loan losses.
Swedbank, the smallest publicly traded bank in Sweden by market capitalisation, fell 5.6 per cent to SKr45.20 
following the release of the Riksbank's financial stability report. The report, issued twice a year, forecast loan losses 
at leading Swedish banks of SKr170bn ($22.8bn) this year and next.
Despite the negative forecast, the central bank's governors were positive about the long-term outlook for the 
nation's financial sector.
"The banks have sufficient capital to meet larger losses than this, and are well-capitalised in an international 
comparison," the Riksbank said in a summary of the report.
Svenska Handelsbanken fell 5.2 per cent to SKr142.75, while Nordea Bank, the largest Swedish bank by market 
capitalisation, was down 2.1 per cent to SKr142.75. SEB fell 3.4 per cent to SKr33.70.
European automakers were the biggest gainers on the FTSE Euronext 300 on hopes they could gain market share 
following the bankruptcy of General Motors in the US on Monday. BMW gained 2.1 per cent, while in Italy, Fiat, 
which pulled out of the deal to buy GM Europe's Opel brand, rose 1.3 per cent to EUR7.89.
However, Volkswagenwas the big winner of the day, rising 10.2 per cent to EUR253.20 after Porsche, its majority 
shareholder, said its merger with the company, which has faced difficulties from both parties in recent months, was 
"the best industrial solution for all sides".
Swedish banks retreat on loan loss fears
VW also gained on market speculation that Qatar may take a stake in heavily indebted Porsche, which would 
benefit VW if the merger is completed.
Overall, the major indices fluctuated modestly as investors took profits from Monday's highs. The FTSE Eurofirst 
300 index closed at 885.88, down just 0.04 per cent, leaving it less than 10 points short of its January high for the 
year.
The CAC 40 in Paris dipped by 0.04 per cent to 3,378.04 and Germany's Xetra Dax was little changed at 5,144.06.
Ireland's Ryanairfell 2.5 per cent to EUR3.54 on news that the leading European low-cost airline recorded a loss 
last year for the first time in 20 years after its attempted takeover of Aer Lingus, its national rival. Underlying profits 
were also hit by high fuel prices early last year.
Howard Wheeldon, of BGC Partners, said: "Ryanair shareholders should demand answers from chief executive 
Michael O'Leary as to why the airline wasted shareholders' funds pursuing a takeover attempt on Aer Lingus that 
few ever thought would succeed. Having written down the value of its shares in Aer Lingus one may assume that 
the hit to the current year may be somewhat less."
Mr Wheeldon also noted that there were concerns about the continuing rate of growth at the low-cost airline, 
including the planned purchase of new Boeing aircraft.
"As yet there are few real signs that the industry will return to growth any time soon though it may just begin to 
recover a touch in 2010," he added.
Aer Lingus shares rose 7.9 per cent to EUR0.70.
Gamesa, a Spanish renewable energy company, fell 8.2 per cent to EUR15.41 following news that Iberdrola, a 
Spanish power company, had placed 10 per cent of Gamesa at EUR16.10 a share.

Barclays shares led London equities lower on Tuesday, hit by confirmation of the sale of a significant stake in the 
bank by its main Middle Eastern investor.
International Petroleum Investment Corp, an investment vehicle of the Abu Dhabi royal family, was finalising a 
placing of 1.3bn Barclays shares with institutional investors. The news came less than seven months after IPIC's 
controversial £3.5bn investment in Barclays , which upset existing institutional investors who were shut out of the 
deal. Brokers said the placing would be priced at 267p a share.
The group also invited offers for its entire £1.5bn holding of Barclays capital notes in a process that will be 
completed by Wednesday. Both sales are being handled by Credit Suisse. Barclays' stock fell 13.5 per cent to 
273.5p.
"Given the stunning rally in Barclays it is understandable that speculators would want to book some profits, and I 
suppose IPIC would fall into that category," said David Morrison, market strategist at GFT.
"I've been calling an end to this rally since it started, so I'm close to giving up. I imagine there are plenty of others 
who feel the same way so once all the shorts go screaming for the exits, we should see a big turn in equities. It 
feels like we're getting there, but we will need some bad news as a catalyst."
In the rest of the banking sector, investors took a cue to book profits after the FTSE 100's recent strong run. HSBC 
fell 3.1 per cent to 535p. Lloyds Banking Group was 4.1 per cent weaker at 69½p and Royal Bank of Scotland was 
5.2 per cent softer at 38.1p.

EasyJet fell 0.3 per cent to 315¼p.
In the wider market, the FTSE 100's strong advance of recent sessions faded under the weight of the banking 
sector, but losses were capped by a better start on Wall Street and by the close the benchmark index was down 29 
points, or 0.7 per cent, to 4,477.02.  It had risen 2 per cent over the previous session to close over 4,500 points at 
its highest level since January 7.

The last time Christy Moore played the Festival Hall - "this room", he called it, familiarity shrinking it into intimacy - 
was more than 20 years ago, in honour of Ken Livingstone.
The cheer he got for a mention of the Greater London Council, the body "Red Ken" used to head, might have 
seduced a lesser performer into nostalgia. Sometimes Moore succumbed. "Missing You" found an Irish labourer 
adrift in Piccadilly Circus, prevented from going home by "the price of a flight", as if Ryanair had never existed. "No 
Time For Love", which slyly conflates Irish Republicanism with the Anti-Apartheid Movement, had acquired some 
"women fighting scabs at the factory gates", a prospect now so distant that it might have been life on Mars.
But "Ordinary Man", about factory closures as the bosses walk away rich, resonated as soundly as ever. With its 
parade of slavers and football fans, "Does This Train Stop On Merseyside?" crystallised Liverpool's mixture of 
truculence and guilt.
Moore was accompanied by Declan Sinnott, the two of them sitting in tiny pools of light amid the darkness. (For 
"Ride On" and "The Cliffs Of Dooneen" the audience added a 2,000-strong choir.) Together, they wove past and 
present into one compelling narrative.
"Don't Forget Your Shovel" started out so bewhiskered that its hate figure was Enoch Powell, industrial archaeology 
in a London whose expatriate Irish are accountants and IT professionals. But it morphed satirically into Daniel 
O'Donnell (a bland countryman of Moore's) receiving an MBE from Prince Charles and a fantasia (one presumes) 
about the Duchess of Cornwall recalling a night of passion with Sinnott at Glastonbury.
Shockingly up to date, after a recent report into child abuse in Ireland, was Joni Mitchell's "The Magdalene 
Laundries", recalling the oubliettes into which the Irish Church and state decanted women who ranged from fallen to 
Christy Moore, Royal Festival Hall, London
inconvenient. At the end, another 1970s flashback came in the form of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", which 
revealed itself as a meditation. "Come on, you martyr to truth and delusion", sang Moore, half to the audience and 
half to himself, "and shine".

European equity markets gained ground this week - with airlines and carmakers grabbing the headlines - though 
progress was fitful.
Indices across the region opened higher on Monday, building on the previous week's gains. But Standard & Poor's 
negative outlook on the UK, along with downbeat comments from the US Federal Reserve, turned markets round 
on Thursday - this in spite of data showing the pace of economic contraction in the eurozone had slowed markedly.
Ascension Day on Thursday meant that many stock markets were closed, including those in Austria, Belgium, 
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Switzerland. Elsewhere, volumes were very low, and continued to be so on Friday.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300, in spite of falling 2.1 per cent on Thursday and 0.2 per cent on Friday, rose 
1.9 per cent to 856.00 over the five sessions.
France's CAC 40 rose 2.3 per cent to 3,227.97 and Germany's Xetra Dax climbed 3.8 per cent to 3,227.97.
Air France-KLM, Europe's biggest airline by passenger traffic, on Wednesday reported a narrower-than-expected 
fourth-quarter loss - albeit its first in a decade.
"We are leading the battle and moving more aggressively than Lufthansa and British Airways" in reducing capacity, 
said Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, chief executive. Investors were apparently satisfied, pushing Air France up 11 per 
cent, its sharpest daily rise in 18 months.
Air France falls after BA results
However, the French carrier lost 3.2 per cent on Friday after Mr Gourgeon's assertions proved prescient and British 
Airways plunged to a record operating loss , with repercussions throughout the sector. Over the five sessions, Air 
France-KLM rose 11 per cent to EUR10.68.
The wider sector was buoyed by JPMorgan branding European airlines as "particularly attractive", describing them 
as "the crown jewels of industrials".
Iberia, Spain's national airline, which is set to merge with BA, rose 7 per cent to EUR1.63. Ireland's Ryanair rose 
1.2 per cent to EUR3.30 and the German Lufthansa lifted 4.3 per cent to EUR9.60.
Carmakers also had an eventful week. On Monday it was revealed that merger talks between Porsche and 
Volkswagen had collapsed. On Friday, Porsche said it would take longer than expected for the two to reach an 
agreement. VW rose 0.9 per cent to EUR223.35 in the week. Porsche was up 14.4 per cent to EUR45.18
Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne's plans for a European supergroup were all but scuppered when German 
officials said Canada's Magna International were early favourites to acquire GM's Opel. Fiat fell 0.2 per cent on the 
news, but rose 4.4 per cent to EUR7.80 over the week.
Peugeot subsidiary Faurecia, the car equipment manufacturer, said that its rights issue had been successful. 
Faurecia fell 9.3 per cent to EUR7.05 over the week, while Peugeot rose 17 per cent to EUR19.69.

Disappointing economic data from Japan did little to curb European markets on Wednesday morning, as they 
continued upward for a third-consecutive session.
Air France-KLM, the Franco-Dutch airliner, posted a smaller-than-expected EUR814m loss for the year, EUR505m 
of which was in the fourth quarter. The group also scrapped its dividend. The results, which Air France attributes to 
reducing staff costs, were welcomed by markets.
The carrier said it would jointly operate transatlantic routes with US airline Delta, sharing revenues and costs for at 
least 10 years. Based on 2008-2009 data, the annual joint venture revenue is estimated at $12 billion, the 
companies said.
Air France-KLM jumped to the top of the Paris bourse, rising 9.7 per cent to EUR11.13, and gave a boost to rival 
airlines. Germany's Lufthansa added 4 per cent to EUR9.89 and Ryanair added 2.5 per cent to EUR3.50.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.6 per cent to a fresh eight-week high of 874.65 by late morning. 
Frankfurt's Xetra Dax rose 0.8 per cent to 4,998.73; and the Paris CAC 40 added 0.5 per cent to 3,921.41.
Banks continued to lead indices for a fifth day.
Despite the chief of French bank Société Générale saying the overall banking sector, including SocGen, was likely 
to produce lower profits in future as a result of the financial crisis did not stop the stock rising 3 per cent to 
EUR39.51. Peer BNP Paribas, meanwhile, rose 1 per cent to EUR46.90 and Germany's Commerzbank rose 0.2 
per cent to EUR5.88.
Airlines help lift European equities
Bank of Ireland added to Tuesday's 22 per cent rise by climbing a further 18 per cent to EUR1.57.
Few sectors suffered losses, but those that did included defensive stocks, such as food producers. Danone lost 0.4 
per cent to EUR39.2, Germany's Suedzucker fell 1.6 per cent to EUR14.32 and drinks group Pernod Ricard fell 1.5 
per cent to EUR45.57.
Novartis, the pharmaceutical company, rose 0.4 per cent to SFr44.60 after it said it was buying the generic cancer 
drugs business of Austria's EBEWE in a bid to boost its medicine unit Sandoz following a number of patent expiries.
The Swiss company said it was paying EUR925m for the business. An analyst at Zeurcher Kantolbank said: "If you 
want to ride first class, you have to pay first class....we see the transaction as strategically sensible, to bring Sandoz 
back to growth."
Elsewhere among pharmaceuticals, Merck rose 1.5 per cent to EUR64.66 and Roche fell 0.2 per cent to 
EUR145.10.

Dozens of European airlines, including budget carriers Ryanair, EasyJet and Wizz Air, have caved in to demands 
from Brussels to improve their websites in a move that should make booking tickets online cheaper and less 
confusing.
European Commission officials will announce on Thursday that more than 50 airlines have reformed their online 
booking sites, or will do so shortly, after the Commission threatened to "name and shame" them in its first EU-wide 
consumer enforcement action.
The reforms will address concerns about the way some fares were displayed, so that taxes and additional charges 
were only added when a purchase was almost complete rather than at the start of the booking process.
There have also been worries about the use of pre-ticked boxes, which forced consumers to opt out of taking 
insurance, for example, and about the advertising of special offers.
Ryanair said it changed its site at the start of April, while EasyJet said it would act during summer. Ryanair said it 
still disagreed with the changes, as some passengers might now fly without travel insurance by mistake.
There is still a hardcore of about half a dozen airlines which either dispute the existence of any problem or have 
refused to reply to Brussels. If no progress is made in these cases, national authorities could be asked to take direct 
enforcement action.
The EU investigation of airlines' ticket selling practices started in September 2007, when an initial study suggested 
that one in three people buying flights online was being misled.

A review in March of practices at nearly 70 airlines found only 16 met appropriate standards, including Finnair and 
Virgin Atlantic.

Anyone who has bought airline tickets on-line knows the problem. An extremely cheap flight is offered - perhaps 
costing as little as a few euros.
But by the time it comes to paying, the price suddenly leaps as a range of unexpected items, from booking fees to 
taxes, is added to the bill right at the end of the transaction.
Worse, the consumer finds that he or she has bought insurance or priority boarding that they did not want simply 
because they failed to spot that options on the website to include extras were "pre-ticked".
This problem, which has bedevilled millions of would-be travellers, has been in the European Commission's sights 
for about 18 months. Back in autumn 2007, it organised a so-called sweep - or survey - by consumer protection 
authorities in 16 member states.
This was the first co-ordinated, pan-EU enforcement action on the consumer front and it revealed hundreds of 
airline and travel websites that were flouting consumer laws. One in every three sites - 137 out of the 388 targeted - 
were misleading or cheating consumers, the sweep revealed.
Since then, there has been a steady tussle with carriers to end sharp practices. Two new pieces of legislation - 
including the unfair commercial practices directive - have taken effect, increasing the authorities' leverage to 
enforce change.
Surveys by the UK consumer group Which show that consumers believe putting bags into the hold, airport check-
desk charges and credit card fees should be included in the advertised price of a flight.
Fees crackdown on carriers bears fruit
EU legislation on airline ticketing advertising, which came into force in November, was supposed to stop airlines 
omitting taxes and additional charges when marketing flight prices.
But consumer groups say many airlines are not adhering to the rules, with Jet2.com and EasyJet among those that 
automatically charge passengers extra fees to check in bags.
Which said that Ryanair was the worst offender in terms of additional charges. Ryanair will charge passengers £40 
or EUR40 to issue a boarding card if they arrive at the airport without one from October as it scraps check-in desks.
When a fresh review of the situation was done in March this year, and sites were marked against a 14-point 
checklist, commission officials said that there were still widespread shortcomings. Sixteen airlines met all standards 
and gave a commitment to maintain their web pages at the same level.
They were: Air Malta, Blue!, bmi, bmibaby, Estonian Air, Finnair, Iberia, Malmo Aviation, SAS, Sata Air Acores, Sata 
International, Spanair, TAP, Tarcom, TUIfly and Virgin Atlantic.
It has taken further discussions to pull a much larger group of about 45 airlines into the fold. Officials will on 
Thursday say they are satisfied that these carriers, too, either have brought their sites up to scratch or are prepared 
to do so. Included in this group is Ryanair, which claimed to be in compliance several weeks ago, as well as some 
other well-known names like Easyjet, Wizzair and Austrian Airlines.
Ryanair, which has also threatened to charge passengers to use aircraft toilets, said on Wednesday that it had 
dropped plans to impose a "fat tax" on obese passengers because it could not find a way of collecting one without 
slowing down the turnaround of aircraft.
The remaining problem is a hard core of about half a dozen airlines which either refuse to respond to the authorities 
or dispute the need to make change. Officials say that, if no progress can be made, those cases could be subject to 
domestic enforcement proceedings.

Inmarsat defies global shipping slowdown

Inmarsat has again defied predictions it would be hard hit by the slowdown in global shipping with underlying growth 
of 7.7 per cent in its key maritime business.
The group provides broadband internet communications for remote areas of the globe and many feared that its 
largest market - providing shipboard satellite phones and internet connections - could be hit by the reduction in 
global shipping.
But first quarter results indicated the growing importance of broadband data services on ships, particularly Navy 
vessels, from communications with headquarters to surfing the web, where Inmarsat can make a connection of 
nearly 500 kilobytes per second.
Data services rose 3.6 per cent while voice services fell 0.8 per cent. The number of terminals used to access 
commercial services in the maritime sector also rose 11.5 per cent to 162,000.
"With these factors in mind, we remain confident in our revenue growth objectives for the year," said Andrew 
Sukawaty, chief executive.
Overall maritime revenues rose just 2.3 per cent as Inmarsat introduced a more even phasing of volume discounts 
across its financial year.
Strongest growth in the quarter came from the aeronautical sector, where revenue rose 32 per cent to $16.8m from 
governmental and corporate jets.
Inmarsat defies global shipping slowdown
The group hopes to see further growth in future as commercial passenger airlines such as Emirates and Ryanair 
begin allowing passengers to make mobile calls mid-flight, using Inmarsat's satellites.
Inmarsat is still being stalked by Harbinger, the US hedge fund, which reiterated in March that it was considering 
making an offer. Mr Sukawaty confirmed Inmarsat had still not received an offer.
Revenue for the quarter rose 10.5 per cent to $163.4m while pre-tax profit rose 23 per cent to $50.3m.
The figures do not include the group's purchase of Stratos Global Corporation, one of its distributors, which was 
completed on April 15.

Strongest growth in the quarter came from the aeronautical sector, where revenue rose 32 per cent to $16.8m from 
governmental and corporate jets.
The group hopes to see further growth in future as commercial passenger airlines such as Emirates and Ryanair 
begin allowing passengers to make mobile calls mid-flight, using Inmarsat's satellites.
Inmarsat is still being stalked by Harbinger, the US hedge fund, which reiterated in March that it was considering 
making an offer. Mr Sukawaty confirmed Inmarsat had still not received an offer but that he had made "no 
impediments" to such an approach. Harbinger has been seeking regulatory clearance ahead of any possible bid.
Revenue for the quarter rose 10.5 per cent to $163.4m while pre-tax profit rose 23 per cent to $50.3m. Free cash 
flow improved by $50m, swinging from an outflow in the first quarter of last year, reflecting the end of capital 
expenditure in new satellites.
"We are going into a period of capex holiday," said Mr Sukawaty. Inmarsat does not require any new financing in 
the next two years, he added.
The figures do not include the group's purchase of Stratos Global Corporation, one of its distributors, which was 
completed on April 15. Stratos gives Inmarsat a direct retail arm for the first time, although sales through other 
distributors will still make up the bulk of its business.
Jonathan Groocock, analyst at Investec Securities, said in a note to clients that Inmarsat's results demonstrated its 
"strong defensive growth credentials". "With figures ahead of forecast we expect to upgrade bottom-line forecasts 
by 5-10 per cent for [2009]."
Inmarsat's shares rose 38p to close at 581p.

Inmarsat has again defied predictions it would be hard hit by the slowdown in global shipping with underlying growth 
of 7.7 per cent in its key maritime business.
The group provides broadband internet communications for remote areas of the globe and many feared that its 
largest market - providing shipboard satellite phones and internet connections - could be hit by the reduction in 
global shipping.
But first quarter results indicated the growing importance of broadband data services on ships, particularly Navy 
vessels, from communications with headquarters to surfing the web, where Inmarsat can make a connection of 
nearly 500 kilobytes per second.
Data services rose 3.6 per cent while voice services fell 0.8 per cent. The number of terminals used to access 
commercial services in the maritime sector also rose 11.5 per cent to 162,000.
"With these factors in mind, we remain confident in our revenue growth objectives for the year," said Andrew 
Sukawaty, chief executive.
"Broadband, which is so heavily used in business now and in our personal lives, has been extended to these 
remote environments. We are tapping an underserved market, which is driving the growth."
He added: "We can see volumes of data traffic and telephone traffic on daily basis and we don't have a slowdown."
Overall maritime revenues rose just 2.3 per cent as Inmarsat introduced a more even phasing of volume discounts 
across its financial year.

British Airways hit by business travel slump

British Airways suffered a further steep fall in demand from business travellers last month. It is a blow to the carrier 
as the category generates the lion's share of the group's profits.
BA's financial performance has come under heavy pressure from the recession and it has already warned that it is 
facing two successive years of losses to March 2010.
Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, told airline staff last week the aviation sector was facing "the worst trading 
conditions" in its history.
BA is being particularly hard hit because of its dependence both on the financial sector and on the North Atlantic 
market.
BA's top 10 corporate customers have reduced their travel budgets and have told the airline that the trend is likely 
to continue.
The group said on Wednesday that it had been hit by a 17.7 per cent fall year-on-year in premium passenger traffic 
in April, a performance worsened by the timing of Easter, which fell in April this year and in March last year.
The Easter holiday reduces premium volumes but increases leisure traffic. BA said its non-premium traffic rose last 
month by 5.2 per cent year-on-year. Capacity was 2.4 per cent lower than a year ago.
BA said market conditions were "very challenging" with business travel volumes under pressure and fare levels 
suffering as airlines discounted prices to try to stimulate traffic.
British Airways hit by business travel slump
Ryanair, Europe's leading low cost carrier, showed on Wednesday that discounting was helping to fill its still rapidly 
growing fleet. It reported a 12 per cent increase year-on-year in passenger numbers in April and said it had filled 82 
per cent of its seats, up from 79 per cent a year ago.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
Aer Lingus, the Irish airline that has been under hostile takeover pressure from Ryanair for more than two years, 
has issued a profit warning and said trading conditions had deteriorated rapidly during the first three months of the 
year.
The airline, which is currently without a chief executive following the resignation this month of Dermot Mannion, 
forecast a loss for 2009 "materially below the bottom of the range of current market expectations".
The airline's share price fell almost 20 per cent, or 14 cents, to close at 56 cents.
Stephen Furlong, aviation analyst at Davy, the Irish stockbroker, said his forecast operating loss for the year for Aer 
Lingus was likely to be more than doubled from EUR41.9m to close to EUR100m (£89m).
He said the airline "faces particular problems given its geographic position and strategic exposure, especially on 
long haul", where the network is exclusively focused on the US.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, which holds a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus and has had two 
takeover bids thwarted, warned yesterday its smaller rival would "run out of cash in two years. Then it will have to 
come back to shareholders for more money".
Aer Lingus warns on profits
Aer Lingus said the airline industry was facing "an exceptionally tough trading environment that has progressively 
deteriorated this year". There had been a rapid deterioration in the prospects for many major carriers and this was 
likely to be exacerbated by concerns about the impact of swine flu on demand.
The airline has made deep cuts in capacity, in particular on long-haul routes, but it said further cost reductions were 
"critical for the viability" of the group.
Average fares on short-haul flights fell 1.6 per cent in the first two months of the year but then collapsed 23.6 per 
cent in March, bringing the quarter down 10.8 per cent year-on-year.
Total revenues fell 16 per cent in the quarter while passenger numbers declined 5.7 per cent on short-haul and 12.5 
per cent on long-haul flights. Aer Lingus cut short-haul capacity by 4.5 per cent and long-haul capacity by 19.5 per 
cent as it tried to keep pace with the collapse in demand.
The group's net cash fell from EUR653.9m to EUR593.6m in the quarter. Although the group still has a strong 
balance sheet, investors have become concerned about the rate of deterioration.
Aer Lingus is conducting an urgent review of its outstanding orders from Airbus.

Pharmaceuticals and fish producers were among the companies defying Monday's swine flu gloom to emerge as 
winners on European bourses.
Pharma stocks performed strongly across the region, boosted by hopes they might develop vaccines targeted at the 
latest outbreak.
Roche was one of the main beneficiaries because the Swiss drugmaker makes the Tamiflu anti-viral treatment. 
Roche shares gained 3.5 per cent to SFr144.50, one of the highest rises on the national index.
Merck, the German pharmaceutical and chemicals group, also enjoyed a successful session, rising 2 per cent to 
EUR67.74 in spite of reporting a worse drop in first-quarter profits than expected
Merck attributed its disappointing results to a fall in demand for the liquid crystals used in display screens. The 
group's outlook for the rest of 2009 was nonetheless fairly upbeat and it said the worst might have passed. Sanofi 
Aventis, meanwhile, rose 2.4 per cent to EUR41.70.
France's Sperian Protection, which makes protective equipment such as face masks, rose 23 per cent to 
EUR34.50, its steepest climb since the 2003 Sars epidemic.
Fish suppliers were among the less likely gainers from the global worry. Previous outbreaks affecting livestock have 
pushed fish prices higher, as anxious consumers view it as a safer option.
Norway's Marine Harvest topped the Oslo index with a 6 per cent rise to NKr2.92, while Austevoll Seafood, a 
salmon farmer and fish food supplier, gained 10.9 per cent to NKr19.40.
Pharmas and fish defy Europe fears
Nireus Aquaculture, the holding company of Greece's Nireus group, which specialises in fish, fish feed, and fish 
farming equipment, climbed 16 per cent to EUR0.80 on the Athens index.
Worldwide, the swine flu scare primarily hit travel and tourism stocks, and Europe was no exception.
Accor, Europe's largest hotelier, lost 3.8 per cent to EUR31.47 on the Paris bourse, while Air France fell 6.5 per 
cent to EUR8.39.
Spain was the first European country to have a confirmed case of the virus, and  Iberia, the national flag carrier, fell 
6.6 per cent to EUR1.42.
Germany's Lufthansa was one of the region's biggest losers, with a 9.2 per cent fall to EUR8.73.
Aer Lingus and Ryanair Holdings fell 4.1 per cent to EUR0.70 and 4.3 per cent to EUR3.30 respectively on the Irish 
stock exchange.
The pan-European Eurofirst 300 index fell in early trade, but recovered in line with Wall Street, ending 0.4 per cent 
higher at 813.69. France's CAC 40 was flat at 3,102.43 and Germany's Xetra Dax index of 30 leading shares 
gained 0.4 per cent to 4,694.07.
In Turkey, the Istanbul stock exchange fell 0.4 per cent to 29,552.26, hit by fears over how the flu outbreak might 
affect tourism and also a shoot-out between far-left militants and the police that left one man dead.
The construction and materials sector enjoyed a positive session, boosted by a broker upgrade.
Credit Suisse changed its recommendation from "underperform" to "outperform" on the sector globally, citing "the 
emergence of incrementally better data from the US housing market".
The broker upgraded Saint Gobain , the French manufacturer of building materials, from "neutral" to "outperform".
Credit Suisse said: "We think Saint-Gobain has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector ... We do not see 
material risks related to refinancing, credit rating or banking covenants,. Saint Gobain shares rose 2.5 per cent to 
EUR27.67.

Pity the pioneer. Southwest Airlines invented low-cost air travel, inspiring imitators around the world. But the US 
carrier last week announced its first quarterly loss in 18 years, and was forced to halt decades of relentless 
expansion by defering delivery of new planes. Are there lessons here for more youthful budget carriers?
In part, Southwest has been a victim of its own success. Stiff competition pushed several of America's legacy 
airlines into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, forcing them to cut costs and thus erode Southwest's advantage. 
Indeed, thanks to aggressive route expansion, Southwest's aircraft typically now fly with a lower proportion of seats 
filled than competitors. Furthermore, there is now a budget choice on around 40 per cent of US routes, compared to 
30 per cent in Europe (and perhaps half that level in Asia, where Malaysia's AirAsia continues to expand).
That suggests there is room for more growth in Europe, where Ryanair and Easyjet still boast costs per passenger 
half that of the flag carriers. And a recession can be an excellent time to expand. In 2002-2003 Ryanair showed 
how cutting prices can stimulate demand by posting record growth of profits and sales. Even this year, it is 
expected to increase traffic by 10 per cent. Easyjet's more cautious approach in the downturn partly reflects its 
greater exposure to recession-hit business travel.
The other main transatlantic difference is the approach to charges. Ryanair will make about a fifth of sales this year 
from ancillary revenues, and is considering new fees for the overweight, or even using toilets in-flight. Southwest by 
comparison merely requests that "customers of size" buy the appropriate number of seats, and trumpets its lack of 
hidden fees as a competitive advantage. Given the US carrier's underperformance of the two European upstarts 
since the credit crunch began, it may be time for the old hand to learn some new tricks.

Aer Lingus, the Irish airline that has been under hostile takeover pressure from Ryanair for more than two years, is 
considering whether to seek a protective alliance with another leading European carrier.
The group announced on Monday that Dermot Mannion, its chief executive, had resigned with immediate effect. Mr 
Mannion said his decision to step down would "allow a new CEO to bring fresh thinking and new ideas to the 
business".
The board is consulting with Goldman Sachs, its financial adviser, on strategic options. These could include the 
opening of alliance talks with one or all of Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways.
The big three carriers are all involved in other merger deals in the wave of consolidation in European aviation.
Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus since October, said the board would consider both internal and external 
candidates to replace Mr Mannion.
Mr Barrington said he was taking over executive responsibility until a successor could be found.
Niall Ferguson, assistant chief executive, and Sean Coyle, chief financial officer, are leading internal candidates to 
succeed Mr Mannion, while there was also speculation on Monday among analysts about the prospects of Brian 
Dunne and Seamus Kearney, former executives in an earlier Aer Lingus management team led by Willie Walsh, 
now chief executive of BA.
The Aer Lingus share price has lost two-thirds of its value in the past year. On Monday it rose 3.5 cents to 70 cents.
Aer Lingus considers alliance
Mr Mannion joined the then state-owned carrier four years ago and has led it through one of the most turbulent 
periods in its history.
It was finally floated by Dublin in September 2006 after government hesitation undermined several previous 
privatisation efforts.
Mr Mannion fought off two hostile takeover bids from Ryanair in two years with support from the Irish government, 
which still holds a 25.1 per cent stake, but the resistance has come at a heavy price to investors.
Ryanair, which has taken big losses on its investment in Aer Lingus, still holds a stake of 29.8 per cent.
It has kept up a sustained attack and has sought to undermine the credibility of the Aer Lingus management and its 
insistence on maintaining the group's independence, as the share price has slumped.
Ryanair's second all-cash hostile bid launched last December was pitched at EUR1.40 a share, half the EUR2.80 
offered in its original bid in October 2006, which valued the company at EUR1.48bn ($1.97bn). Since the failure of 
the second bid the share price has virtually halved again.
The first Ryanair takeover offer was blocked by the European competition authorities. The Irish government also 
opposed the second bid for competition reasons and said this year it remained in favour of Ireland maintaining two 
leading carriers.
Mr Mannion's position has been undermined by Aer Lingus's deteriorating financial performance and its gloomy 
forecasts for 2009.
Investors also became concerned, when details emerged during the takeover battle earlier this year of a 
confidential and favourable pay-off deal for Mr Mannion and some other executives in the event of a hostile 
take­over succeeding and the executives deciding to leave. The deal was later rescinded.

Colm Barrington, chairman of the group, said the board had started the process of selecting a new chief executive

The Aer Lingus share price has fallen in the past year from more than EUR2 to a low of under EUR0.57 in recent

It rose 8.27 per cent to EUR0.72 on Mondayon the news of Mr Mannion's departure.
Mr Mannion, who joined the then Irish state-owned carrier four years ago, has led the airline through one of the 
most turbulent periods of its history. It was floated by Dublin in September 2006 after government hesitation had 
undermined several attempts at privatisation, but within days of the initial public offering it came under attack from 
local rival Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline.
Mr Mannion, who was recruited to Aer Lingus from Emirates, fought off two hostile takeover bids from Ryanair in 
two years with support from the Irish government, which still holds a 25.1 per cent stake.
But the resistance has come at a heavy price to investors.
Aer Lingus chief resigns suddenly
Ryanair, which has taken big losses on its investment in Aer Lingus, is the biggest shareholder and still holds a 
stake of 29.8 per cent.
It has kept up a heavy attack against Aer Lingus's efforts to thwart its takeover bids and has undermined the 
credibility of the group's management and the insistence on maintaining independence, as the share price has 
tumbled.
Aer Lingus profitability fell last year to a net loss of EUR107.8m ($145m) from a net profit of EUR105.3m a year 
earlier.
It fell to an operating loss of EUR17.6m, before employee profit share and net exceptional items, from a profit of 
EUR88.5m in 2007.
Along with other airlines it was hit hard by the rise in fuel prices in the first half of last year and then by the growing 
impact of the recession.
Aer Lingus incurred restructuring costs of EUR117.5m as Mr Mannion struggled to reshape the group and cut costs 
to make it more competitive, not least against Ryanair.

The Aer Lingus share price has plunged in the last year from more than EUR2 to a low of under EUR0.57 in recent

It has kept up a heavy attack against Aer Lingus's efforts to thwart its takeover bids and has undermined the 
credibility of the group's management and its insistence on maintaining the group's independence, as the share 
price has tumbled.
Ryanair's second all-cash hostile bid launched last December took advantage of the already depressed Aer Lingus 
share price with an offer valuing Aer Lingus equity at EUR748m.
It offered EUR1.40 a share exactly half what it offered in its original bid in October 2006, which valued the company 
at EUR1.48bn. Since the failure of the second bid the share price has virtually halved again.
The first Ryanair takeover offer was blocked by the European competition authorities on the grounds that the 
enlarged carrier would have a virtual monopoly of operations at Dublin airport and in the Irish market. The Irish 
government also opposed the second bid for competition reasons.
Aer Lingus profitability plunged last year to a net loss of EUR107.8m from a net profit of EUR105.3m a year earlier. 
It fell to an operating loss of EUR17.6m, before employee profit share and net exceptional items, from a profit of 
EUR88.5m in 2007.
Like other airlines it was hit hard by the surge in fuel prices in the first half of last year and then by the growing 
impact of the deepening recession. Aer Lingus also incurred heavy restructuring costs of EUR117.5m, however, as 
Mr Mannion struggled to reshape the group and to cut costs to make it more competitive, not least against Ryanair, 
the lowest cost airline in Europe.
Aer Lingus has maintained a strong balance sheet, but investors have shown increasing concern at the erosion of 
its net cash balance, which fell from EUR757 to EUR654m last year, and is forecast to fall further this year
The airline said last month that since the start of the year, "the continued and accelerating flow of negative 
economic data from the Irish and international markets, together with the increasing numbers of people out of work" 
had weakened consumer demand.
Passengers were increasingly booking later and it was being forced to lower fares in order to fill seats. It forecast 
average fares would fall by a minimum of 10 per cent this year.
It forecast a larger operating loss and said "in these circumstances the group is unlikely to meet its previous 
guidance of a pre-tax profit in 2009."

Two airline departures: one unscheduled, one early - and both apparently prompted by fatigue. Aer Lingus chief 
Dermot Mannion's sudden take-off, after a four-year stint, was unexpected. The former Emirates man was seen as 
a sound choice to put Aer Lingus on a sustainable heading after it listed in 2006. Yet his exit suggests he had tired 
of battling Ryanair at home and EasyJet and others abroad.
Meanwhile, EasyJet chairman Colin Chandler, who steps down in July, had been expected to stay until the autumn, 
allowing time for Sir Michael Rake, his likely successor, to relinquish other commitments. However, after a 
protracted public debate between the low-cost airline's founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, and the board over 
strategy, Mr Chandler's early bolt for the exit suggests he had had enough. Neither departure reflects well on the 
company concerned.
Mr Mannion is leaving to "allow a new CEO to bring fresh thinking and new ideas to the business". Deeper cost 
cutting and a supportive majority shareholder are what Aer Lingus really needs. The latter may be too much to ask; 
Ryanair holds almost 30 per cent and has twice bid for the airline.
EasyJet also has a tricky majority shareholder issue. Sir Stelios and his siblings own 38 per cent of the airline. 
Whereas investors in EasyJet have diversified portfolios, EasyJet is Sir Stelios's most successful business asset. 
Anxious to protect it, he believes the airline should throttle back on expansion the better to weather the downturn.
Ryanair has no such problems - or doubts. It is still expanding fast, bolstered by a cost-cutting culture that is so 
extravagant that no expense, literally, is spared. Compare that strategy of higher risk but high reward with its two 
biggest competitors, and it is hard to avoid the impression that EasyJet has lost its bottle, while Aer Lingus has lost 
its way.

Two airline departures: one unscheduled, one early – and both apparently prompted by fatigue. Aer Lingus chief 
Dermot Mannion’s sudden take-off, after a four-year stint, was unexpected. The former Emirates man was seen as

of battling Ryanair at home and EasyJet and others abroad.

Air Berlin withholds dividend again
Air Berlin withholds dividend again

Air Berlin, Europe's third-largest budget airline, said it would not pay a dividend this year - the third consecutive year 
it has withheld payment since listing in 2006 - after net losses almost doubled to EUR75m in 2008 from EUR39.9m 
the previous year.
Cost cuts to fight the effects of recession had helped boost earnings before interest and taxes to EUR14.2m after a 
loss of EUR21.5m in 2007, and revenues increased 6.6 per cent to EUR3.4bn thanks to strong sales growth mid-
year.
But financial-market turmoil in the fourth quarter led to big currency-swap losses. This and the inability to write off 
losses against tax dragged Air Berlin into a net loss - this is the second year in a row the carrier has been in the red.
This took the fizz out of the stock, which rose as much as 12 per cent on Monday after Air Berlin said over the 
weekend two anchor investors had taken stakes totalling 35 per cent. It had retreated to just 3.3 per cent higher by 
early afternoon.
Europe's third biggest budget carrier after Ireland's Ryanair and Easyjet of the UK said it transported 28.6m 
passengers last year, 1.4 per cent more than 2007 - although it warned the gain could be wiped out again this year.
Bookings seen at the start of the year allowed "room for some optimism", the carrier added. But it did not give an 
earnings outlook, and noted ongoing cost cuts - rather than sales growth - would be "a pillar" of profitability.

My company, OnAir, and other aircraft communication service providers, are enabling passengers to use their own 
mobile devices during flight.
People all over the world are travelling more - and the desire to stay in touch while on the move is growing.
Everywhere you see people in transit they are using mobile phones and BlackBerrys - from waiting rooms, cars, 
trains, buses and airports.
Until very recently, the one exception was on board aircraft. But after extensive development, testing and 
certification, this is changing as an increasing number of airlines launch inflight passenger communications 
services.
Now BlackBerry-type devices or a laptop fitted with a GSM data card can send and receive e-mails and text 
messages, access the internet and make and receive voice calls directly from onboard aircraft while in the air.
For users of the service, charges will appear on their normal mobile phone bill at rates set by their operator, which 
are similar to overseas roaming charges.
If you have not had an opportunity to use these services, you are not alone, as the industry is only just taking off.
A growing number of commercial airlines on every continent either currently offer inflight communications services 
or plan to offer them soon. These include Air Asia, Airblue, British Airways, bmi, Jazeera Airways, Kingfisher, Oman 
Air, Royal Jordanian, Ryanair, Shenzhen Airlines, TAM, TAP and Wataniya Airways.
Soapbox: Airborne phones break the sound barrier
British Airways recently announced plans to launch services beginning autumn 2009 on its new twice-daily, all-
business-class route from London City Airport to New York City's JFK Airport.
There are 12 other commercial airlines and private jet operators with aircraft equipped to launch mobile services in 
coming months.
Although concern has been expressed by some about the possibility of increased noise in the cabin caused by 
phone conversation, our experience in deploying the service has been overwhelmingly positive, with 80 per cent of 
passengers who have used the service wishing to see it deployed on the airline's entire fleet.
Importantly, airlines can choose to offer inflight communications services whenever, however and wherever they 
want.
For example, the Mobile OnAir service comes with a special control panel that enables the crew to allow data 
transfer and SMS only at certain times. It is therefore very easy to create a "quiet time" on the night portion of an 
overseas flight when most passengers are sleeping.
According to a 2008 survey sponsored by Airline Business and Sita, an air travel communications specialist, 42 to 
44 per cent of European airlines plan to offer some form of onboard mobile telephony within the next one to two 
years.
You may think that the global financial crisis would slow the adoption of inflight communications services. Not so. If 
anything, it is increasing the desire among both airlines and passengers to have these services onboard. Why? 
With recent volatility and the sheer pace with which major market changes have occurred, passengers feel a 
stronger need than ever to stay in touch.
For business travellers in particular, timely decisions and communications concerning high priority projects are 
critical.
Inflight communications enable them to work in real time, connect with colleagues, and to participate in business 
decisions while they fly.
For the airlines, inflight passenger communications offer an opportunity to enhance the travel experience.
Not only do these services help airlines differentiate themselves from competitors, they can also provide much-
needed ancillary revenue.
With Mobile OnAir, for example, airlines receive a share of the communications revenue generated on the flight.
They can also use the technology to create their own inflight customer relationship management programme to 
increase loyalty and satisfaction among their premium customers.
Imagine, for example, receiving information on gate changes, connecting flights and lost luggage directly on your 
mobile phone while you are still in the air.
There is no doubt that inflight communications are transforming the air travel experience. Not only does it create a 
new way for us to stay in touch, it also brings a whole new meaning to "working on the plane".
Whether it's making time-critical business decisions in turbulent markets, calling home to say good night to our 
families, or managing travel arrangements on the move, inflight communications offer new benefits and new 
possibilities to all who travel by air.

Runway success - Ryanair

Michael O'Leary is having a good recession. While most airlines around the world are seeking to cut capacity and 
defer or even cancel new aircraft orders, the iconoclastic Ryanair chief executive is keeping the throttle wide open.
Ryanair has led the low-cost airline revolution in Europe. It did not invent the business model, which originated in 
the US with Herb Kelleher's Southwest Airlines. But it has implemented it with exemplary and unmatched zeal and 
discipline.
The company can be abrasive and is often not an easy bedfellow. But it has been hugely successful since it 
adopted the low-cost business model in the early 1990s as a small struggling Irish airline burdened with heavy 
losses and struggling to stay in business.
It has changed the face of aviation in Europe and, with the other low-cost carriers that have followed in its wake, 
most notably EasyJet, it has forced the traditional full-service network airlines to change the way they do business.
In the past year it has over­taken Lufthansa and Air France-KLM to become the biggest short-haul airline in Europe, 
as measured by the number of passengers, handling 57.7m customers in 2008.
Yet today, many airline executives believe the industry is facing the worst crisis in its history.
The nightmare of soaring fuel prices has only just begun to recede from its peak at $147 a barrel last July while 
passenger demand fell in January for the fifth month in succession. Airlines are struggling to take enough seats out 
of the market to match the fall in demand. Already, more than 11 per cent of the global aircraft fleet is grounded.
Runway success - Ryanair
There has also been an "unprecedented and shocking" plunge in global air cargo traffic, according to Giovanni 
Bisignani, director general of Iata, the global airline trade association. "Alarm bells are ringing everywhere. The 
industry is in a global crisis and we have not yet seen the bottom," he said last month.
And that suits Mr O'Leary just fine.
He is sticking to his tried and tested formula of making a big grab for market share in a downturn. As his 
competitors retrench and some go out of business altogether, he believes Ryanair's unchallenged position as the 
lowest-cost, lowest-fares operator in Europe will allow it to continue to grow and take market share from higher-cost 
rivals. He is still aiming to increase passenger numbers to 67m in the 12 months to March 2010 and to 87m by 
March 2012.
Encouraged rather than daunted - in public at least - by the deepening recession, Mr O'Leary says Ryanair capacity 
will be 15 per cent higher this summer than a year ago. He has no plans to slow the delivery of new aircraft from 
Boeing, and is sticking to the plan to double profits and passenger numbers between 2007 and 2012.
The single-type fleet of more than 180 Boeing 737-800s is due to rise to 292 by March 2012 based on existing firm 
orders. It recently exercised options for 13 more jets for delivery in 2011 and has only 10 more options left to 
exercise under existing orders.
It is already relentlessly plotting the next phase of growth. It is in early talks with Boeing and has had contact with 
Airbus about a potential order for between 200 and 400 short-haul jets, one of the biggest-ever purchases of new 
aircraft, for delivery mainly in the second half of the next decade.
It is aiming to take advantage of the rapidly weakening commercial aerospace market, where new orders to Boeing 
and Airbus have already plunged and production is set to follow.
Ryanair is seeking to repeat its coup of seven years ago, when it placed its previous biggest order for 100 aircraft 
and another 50 options close to the bottom of the last aviation recession. It secured one of the largest discounts 
ever agreed by the US aircraft maker, which was desperate for new orders. Mr O'Leary gleefully described the 
discounts at the time as "rapacious".
Dealing as a supplier with Ryanair is a difficult experience; the airline uses its growing size and power to drive down 
costs.
One supplier says: "It is fantastically efficient and very successful, with a clear sight of how it wants to deliver its 
objectives. But it is ruthlessly cost-driven. It does not believe it should pay any airport, as it brings in what it regards 
as its passengers. It wants to dictate everything."
According to one chief executive in the airline industry: "Ryanair's cash mountain lets it burn off any competition. It 
can use its dominance to drive out competition. Michael O'Leary does not like anyone on his patch."
Many of the features of the low-cost airline model are long established. The assets are sweated with high utilisation 
of the aircraft and quick airport turnrounds. Secondary airports are preferred. Booking is usually via the internet, 
cutting out travel agents. Services are unbundled and charged separately, from onboard food to checked bags. Mr 
O'Leary has even considered charging passengers to use the toilets on board its aircraft.
By the first half of next year, he is planning to abolish conventional check-in facilities at airports across the Ryanair 
network, forcing all passengers to check-in online before leaving home or office and to print off their own boarding 
cards, as part of the effort to lower airport handling costs.
Ryanair has led the drive among airlines to increase ancillary revenues, including commissions from hotel, car 
rental and travel insurance bookings made via its website. It is also at the forefront of launching inflight mobile 
phone services. Such revenues help to offset the lower fares.
Runway success - Ryanair
To fill the extra seats, Ryanair's average fares are forecast to fall by 20 per cent in the current quarter from January 
to March, and by 10 per cent or more in the next financial year to March 2010.
The airline believes the heavy fare discounts and relentless cut-price seat promotions can be paid for by the big 
drop in fuel costs that is resulting from the fall in the crude oil price.
Profits have plunged in the last 12 months under pressure from the soaring fuel price, but the airline has forecast it 
will return to "substantial profitability" in the next 12 months.
"The longer and deeper this recession, the better it will be for the lowest-cost producers in every sector," says Mr 
O'Leary. "Like Lidl, Aldi, Ikea and McDonald's, Ryanair is the lowest-cost provider - by a distance - in the European 
airline industry, and we are poised for substantial traffic and profit growth in the coming year as the recession forces 
millions of passengers to focus on price."
Rivals have questioned how long Ryanair can continue to grow. Its closest low-cost competitor, EasyJet, has 
slammed on the brakes in recent months, as its founder and biggest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, urges 
much greater caution in the face of a long, deep recession.
According to a leading aviation analyst, however, Ryanair still has ample scope for further growth.
"It has a lot of runway ahead of it," he says.
..................................
Turf guy image: a man who plays to win
Michael O'Leary enjoys winning. The combative chief executive of Ryanair took the Cheltenham Gold Cup, the UK's 
premier horse race, at the first attempt in 2006 with War of Attrition, one of the string of horses owned by his 
Gigginstown House Stud. Last year, Hear the Echo won the Irish Grand National for him.
Mr O'Leary breeds horses and cattle at his 200-acre farm in Ireland's County Westmeath, although the family 
undertaking is something of an indulgence. "There is no prospect of making money. I only work in the airline to pay 
for the farm losses," he jokes.
While farming is his passion, it is Ryanair that has made his fortune. First hired as a tax consultant by Tony Ryan, 
the legendary Irish businessman, he became a director of Mr Ryan's struggling airline in 1988, emerging as chief 
executive in 1994.
Before the airline was floated in 1997 he had a stake of 17.9 per cent, but he has sold down steadily to 4.4 per cent 
by last summer, cashing in on the carrier's success.
At turns arrogant and rude, then charming, affable and humorous, Mr O'Leary has terrorised rivals and regul­ators 
for more than a decade. And so far they have waited in vain for him to trip up and for his enthusiasm to wane.
Yet for how much longer he intends to work at the airline is never entirely clear. For at least five years, he has been 
leaving in about two years' time, and at 48 he has already been chief executive of the Irish carrier for 15 years. He 
toys publicly about one day starting a low-cost long-haul airline with ownership separate from Ryanair.

UK airports are going through the biggest shake-up in their history.
The dismantling of BAA, the world's biggest airports operator, ordered on Thursday by the Competition 
Commission, will for the first time put the ownership of the country's leading airports in different, largely private, 
hands.
But it is still far from clear what the break-up will mean for achieving the government's big goal of an expansion of 
capacity and the building of new runways in the highly congested south-east of England.
Future development of the airport sector is clouded by political uncertainty, with a general election due in little more 
than a year and a complete lack of consensus between the two leading parties about the wisdom of building new 
runways.
The Labour government recently gave its approval for BAA's plans to build a third runway at London's Heathrow, 
the country's only hub airport, which has been hampered for years by a shortage of runway capacity.
Operating from just two runways and at around 99 per cent of capacity, its competitiveness has  been undermined 
by other European hubs, most importantly Charles de Gaulle in Paris, Frankfurt Airport and Amsterdam's Schiphol, 
which have all built more diverse global networks, helped by more runways and more available capacity.
But the Conservatives have expressed outright opposition to the building of a third runway - ever since a shock 
decision was taken at last autumn's party conference - and have promised to stop the process in its tracks. BAA, 
which will continue to hold on to London's Heathrow airport, the prize asset in its portfolio, regardless of the break-
up, is being urged by the government to bring forward a planning application for a new runway to be operational 
UK airports face long haul to sort out their baggage
"early in the period between 2015 and 2020". However, a change of power at Westminster would put the issue back 
into the realm of debate.
Competition could help improve the much-derided quality of service at London's airports, but extra capacity will take 
years to complete. Christopher Clarke, chairman of the BAA airports inquiry, said on Thursday the sale of London's 
Gatwick and Stansted airports, as well as either Edinburgh or Glasgow in Scotland, would "kick-start a process of 
competitive rivalry from a standing start where today there is no competition at all".
But he acknowledged that, while some of the benefits could be expected from the outset, others "such as those 
resulting from competition in delivering new runway capacity at Stansted and Heathrow, may be some years away".
Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's director of legal and regulatory affairs, welcomed the Commission's report and said: "The 
BAA monopoly has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient, gold-
plated and overly expensive facilities, encouraged by an ineffectual and incompetent regulator, the Civil Aviation 
Authority." He said competition in the airline industry had delivered huge benefits for consumers and this would be 
replicated at the three main London airports.
Ashley Steel, head of transport and infrastructure at KPMG, said the move to split up BAA "is a harsh decision 
which couldn't come at a worse time for BAA. To complete the sale of three airports within two years as the 
Commission has ordered will be difficult, particularly in the current environment with little or no debt around and with 
air passenger numbers falling. Valuations will be tricky".
Whatever the fate of the individual airports, for the UK competition authorities the BAA case marks a watershed. It 
is the biggest demonstration of the new powers, acquired in the 2002 Enterprise Act, to order far-reaching 
divestitures to remedy competition failings in a particular industry.

Eurocamp to pitch its tent in Britain

Eurocamp, purveyor of sun, sea and sangria holidays under canvas, is to set up "Brit camps" this summer as it 
expects cash-strapped families to rediscover the great British countryside.
Holidaybreak, which owns the Eurocamp, Keycamp and PGL adventure holiday brands, believes the stronger euro 
and people's straitened financial circumstances will force many more holidaymakers to stay at home rather than go 
abroad.
Carl Michel, chief executive, says the nine sites for its "UK Escapes" in the Lake District, Snowdonia, Yorkshire, 
Scotland and the south-west of England should appeal to families on a tight budget. The group is reviving domestic 
holidays 15 years after it abandoned its last three UK campsites for lack of demand.
"We think the UK consumer will be UK-based this year. People are being driven by value and £155 for a weekend 
in the school summer holidays is good value," Mr Michel said.
Eurocamp's six-berth tents will be on sites run by the Forestry Commission or National Trust with facilities such as 
warm showers. They will have the same beds, kitchen and outside barbecue as on the continent. Locations include 
the banks of Loch Lomond, the foot of Mount Snowdon and the New Forest.
In place of the usual high-octane children's entertainers, seven sites have forest rangers to teach animal tracking 
and fire-making skills.
However, the sunshine of a typical French or Italian Eurocamp might be missing. For that reason, while sites are 
available by the week, Mr Michel is targeting the short-break market.
Eurocamp to pitch its tent in Britain
"We should not forget that we have had two wet and windy summers and there is no guarantee the next one won't 
be as well. For their main holiday people will go where they want and where they know the sun will shine. They 
might have one week instead of two," he said.
People would swap long weekends abroad for breaks within driving distance, he predicted.
The ex-McKinsey consultant said it was too early to judge if the recession would bring a permanent return to the 
traditional annual holiday. But the era of high demand for cheap flights could be coming to an end.
"What is ludicrously expensive is to fly to some city you don't quite know how to pronounce for the weekend just 
because Ryanair has a flight there. By the time you have paid your taxes, baggage and a hotel it isn't so cheap."

BAA is free to raise capacity at London Stansted airport by 40 per cent to 35m passengers a year after an appeal 
against the expansion was defeated in the High Court.
The airports operator faces tough financial penalties if its service to passengers and airlines is poor, however, under 
a five-year price control regime for Stansted announced separately on Friday by the Civil Aviation Authority. The 
new rules are to be introduced next month.
Last October, ministers approved growth from the previous limit of 25m in spite of opposition from environmental 
groups, councils and residents.
The Stop Stansted Expansion campaign mounted a challenge, saying the government had breached the law by 
failing to take full account of the environmental and economic impact of allowing more flights.
Sir Thayne Forbes, sitting as a judge of the High Court, said the protesters' criticisms of the way in which the 
planning inquiry inspector and the transport department had handled the issues were "without substance".
Nick Barton, commercial and development director at Stansted, said the social and economic case for expansion of 
capacity from the single runway "remains strong".
Stansted can increase the maximum number of passengers using the airport on the single runway from 25m to 
35m, while the number of flights to and from the airport can be increased from 241,000 to 264,000.
Passenger traffic at Stansted, the most important airport for low-cost airlines in Europe, has been falling for more 
than a year. The number in the first two months was 13.8 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago, and 
Move to block Stansted expansion dismissed
traffic has been falling year-on-year for 16 months in succession. In the 12 months to the end of February, Stansted 
handled 21.9m passengers.
Plans by BAA for a second runway and terminal face delays because of uncertainty over future ownership of the 
airport.
The Competition Commission is to report next week on its two-year investigation into the structure of BAA. It is 
expected to demand the break-up of the world's biggest airports operator - a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial since 
2006. The commission is also likely to call for the sale of Gatwick, Stansted and Glasgow or Edinburgh.
The CAA, the airports economic regulator, said Stansted would be obliged to repay charges totalling up to £10m 
($14m)a year to airlines if it failed to meet the terms of a new service regime.
Ryanair, the low-cost carrier, said the CAA's proposal was "too little too late after it has presided over years of 
abysmal service at Stansted and its history of rubber stamping cost increases for airports".

Broadband behind 55% advance at Inmarsat

Like its satellites, Inmarsat appeared to defy gravity on Thursday as it announced a 55 per cent rise in annual pre-
tax profits.
In spite of the downturn, the British satellite operator has benefited from growing use of broadband internet 
communications on ships and aircraft and in remote areas of the globe, boosting pre-tax profits from $124.7m to 
$193.8m (£140m).
Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive, said the company's satellite technology tended to be seen as essential 
equipment by its customers.
"We are used in places where there is no existing infrastructure. There is no alternative," he said.
Some analysts had feared that Inmarsat's largest business sector - providing shipboard satellite phones and 
internet connections - could be hit by the reduction in global shipping. However, maritime revenue rose 7.2 per cent 
in 2008.
"Communications is only about half a per cent of the cost of operating a container ship, while fuel is about 20 to 30 
per cent. Running a monitoring programme, via satellite, that allows you to get greater fuel efficiency from the 
engine will save more money than cutting back on communications," Mr Sukawaty said. "There is a trend to use 
more rather than less of this equipment."
The biggest growth came in the aeronautical sector, where revenue rose 45 per cent to $64.4m. Inmarsat allows 
phone calls and internet access on corporate and government jets. Commercial passenger airlines such as 
Broadband behind 55% advance at Inmarsat
Emirates and Ryanair have also begun allowing passengers to make mobile calls in mid-flight, using Inmarsat's 
satellites.
Mr Sukawaty also said the company, which owns 11 satellites, was planning to launch a mobile satellite phone in 
the first half of 2010, with a target of 10 per cent market share in two years.
Revenue for the year to December 31 was up 72 per cent from $576.5m to $996.7m, although this in part reflected 
the acquisition of Stratos Global Corporation, one of its distributors, which Inmarsat is to complete next month.
The final dividend rises 5 per cent to 18.2 cents, bringing the total to 30.33 cents (29.46 cents).
Shares in Inmarsat, which have fallen more than 22 per cent since last September, rose 29p to 459pp.
FT Comment
With about 40 per cent of its business coming from government and defence, part of Inmarsat's revenue is always 
going to be fairly secure. Thursday's news that shipping revenue is holding up well is added relief. Two things make 
Inmarsat potentially exciting. First, the prospect of a takeover by Harbinger, the US hedge fund, if it can get 
approval from US government. That could come this summer. Even if there is no deal, Inmarsat's satellites are 
becoming more important as governments want to ensure ubiquitous broadband access. Satellite coverage will 
become an important way to achieve those hopes. The stock looks fairly resilient with some long-term upside 
potential, and is therefore not a bad bet.

Aer Lingus shares lost about a quarter of their value after the Irish carrier warned it was “unlikely” to report a pre-tax 
profit in 2009.
Announcing results for the year to December 31, the Irish airline on Wednesday revealed a pre-tax loss of €119.7m 
(£111m) compared with a profit of €124.8m in 2007.
Dermot Mannion, chief executive, said: “Falling consumer demand in key markets, a weakening dollar and sterling, 
and increased competition across the network combined to put sustained and significant pressure on our business 
throughout the year”.
Stripping out an exceptional charge of €140.9m – including €117.5m related to early retirement and severance 
costs of its labour restructuring – the airline made a profit of €21.2m, down 84 per cent from €131.1m in 2007.
Turnover increased 5.6 per cent to €1.36bn, with passenger numbers up but average fares declining. Passenger 
revenue rose 2.5 per cent, while turnover from ancillary services such as inflight sales, baggage handling charges 
and online booking fees rose almost 38 per cent.
However, the airline was hit by a €148m increase in its fuel bill as a result of rising oil prices earlier in the year.
In December, in its defence of Ryanair’s takeover bid, Aer Lingus said it “expects to report a profit in 2009”. But it 
now said it “will experience a larger operating loss than in 2008 and …the group is unlikely to meet its previous 
guidance of a pre-tax profit in 2009”.
Aer Lingus shares plunge on warning
The bid collapsed when the Irish government, which retains 25 per cent of Aer Lingus, rejected Ryanair’s €1.40 a 
share offer.
Shares in Aer Lingus closed down 19.2 cents at 58 cents.
● FT Comment
One of Aer Lingus’ main attractions for Ryanair was its large cash balances, a legacy of privatisation and Willie 
Walsh’s restructuring. The fall in the shares was prompted less by the profits warning than the company’s guidance 
on cash burn, with net cash falling from €650m at the end of 2008 to €400m-€430m by the end of the current year. 
The company expects losses at the operating level to worsen this year. Airlines are notoriously susceptible to global 
recessions. Colm Barrington, chairman, said he expected a number to fail. As the operating environment worsens, 
only if Aer Lingus can reduce unit costs further can it avoid more cash outflows.

Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, the two leading European airlines, announced further capacity reductions for the 
summer season on Wednesday in the face of the deepening world recession.
Airlines around the globe are being hit by the mounting crisis in the aviation sector. More are seeking to defer 
delivery of new aircraft, undermining the outlook for production at jetmakers Airbus and Boeing, and smaller 
producers such as Brazil's Embraer and Canada's Bombardier.
Cathay Pacific, the de facto Hong Kong flag carrier, reported its biggest annual loss in its 63-year history as it felt 
the impact of a sharp fall in demand for air travel and wrong-way bets on the hedging of its fuel purchases.
In Ireland Aer Lingus, which has fought off a second hostile takeover bid from Ryanair, announced it had fallen into 
loss last year and warned it was "unlikely" to report a pre-tax profit this year as passenger fares and cargo volumes 
fall sharply. Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, which owns 29 per cent of Aer Lingus, accused the Aer 
Lingus board of "misleading" shareholders, and said he planned to submit formal complaints to the London and 
Irish stock exchanges, the take-over panel and the financial services regulator.
Cathay said 2009 would remain "extremely challenging" as the financial crisis curbed passenger and cargo traffic. It 
warned that high hedging losses would continue to hurt its bottom line, if fuel prices remained at their present level. 
"The aviation industry is in crisis," said Christopher Pratt, Cathay's chairman. "We cannot say how and when things 
may get better. Our assumption at this stage is that demand and yield will continue to slide in the coming months."
To counter the recession, Cathay has already cut capacity, grounded flights, delayed construction of a cargo 
terminal and offered unpaid leave to staff.
Airline industry 'in crisis'
German carrier Lufthansa said it was cutting its dividend sharply and reducing planned capacity growth, as it 
reported a two-thirds fall in net profit in 2008 due in part to the impact of some troubled investments.
But, with demand for air travel falling as the global recession bites, Wolfgang Mayrhuber, Lufthansa chief executive, 
said 2009 sales and operating profit would fall well below 2008 levels.

Cross-border mergers and acquisitions are as elusive to investment bankers as to the airlines they once flew. 
British Airways, taxiing towards a merger with Spain's Iberia, says fewer passengers flew at the sharp end of its 
planes in February. Premium traffic slumped by a fifth as business and first class flyers evaporated. The downturn 
also grounded business passengers at Air France-KLM, Europe's largest airline, where passenger traffic fell 6 per 
cent overall. Less class-conscious SAS and Finnair respectively reported a 20 per cent slump and a 2.5 per cent 
surge, mainly on leisure and transatlantic flights.
In less turbulent times high-margin passengers accounted for the bulk of airlines' earnings. Now some are switching 
to low-cost carriers. Even so, traffic fell nearly 7 percent at Easyjet, though larger Ryanair bucked the trend with a 
rise.
Still, storm clouds loom for the whole industry. Business travel and air cargo revenue could fall by up to a fifth this 
year, while passenger revenue could slide at least 5 per cent, leading to a 6-7 per cent decline in underlying 
revenue, according to Citi. BA, for one, is steeling itself for two years of operating losses. All airlines can cut costs 
though. Ryanair makes a habit of it, while also charging for just about everything except the air passengers breathe. 
Some airlines are stuck with costly fuel hedges, taken out last year. Capacity cuts can work: last month's 9 per cent 
reduction by British Airways helped boost its load factor marginally, though a 4.5 per cent cut did not help Air 
France-KLM. Contrarian Ryanair meanwhile increased capacity and routes.
So there is no quick, universal fix. In this turbulence, low-cost operators may be more manoeuvrable and benefit 
from flag carriers' capacity cuts. Yet, if the turbulence is prolonged, British Airways, with a healthy balance sheet 
and hopefully Iberia at its side, begins to look the business.

Stansted planning inquiry is postponed
Stansted planning inquiry is postponed

Body
The start of the planning inquiry into the building of a second runway and second terminal at London Stansted by 
BAA has been postponed by ministers because of the uncertainty over the future ownership of the airport.
The Competition Commission is expected in a landmark report this month to demand the break-up of BAA, the 
world's biggest airports operator and, since 2006, a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial.
It is likely to call for the sale of Gatwick and Stansted and one of either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports in order to 
improve competition in the UK airports market and to end BAA's monopoly of the leading London and Scottish 
airports.
It is not yet clear whether BAA, which owns seven UK airports, including Heathrow, will fight the demand that it sell 
Stansted, the third largest UK airport and the most important base for low-cost airlines in Europe, but the new 
owners are expected to want to alter the nature of the BAA development scheme.
Hazel Blears, the communities and local government secretary, bowed on Monday to the growing pressure from 
opponents of the second runway and from Ryanair and EasyJet, the biggest airlines operating at the airport, and 
agreed that the planning inquiry be delayed.
"I am certain that we should neither be seen to second-guess the contents of the final report [by the Commission] 
nor the response of the airport operator [BAA] until after they have had time to consider its findings and 
implications," she said.
Stansted planning inquiry is postponed
A planning inquiry, expected to last 18 months and starting only a couple of weeks after the publication of the 
watchdog's report, would not allow BAA sufficient time "to consider its findings fully, including any possible 
implications for the inquiry", said Ms Blears.
BAA applied a year ago for planning permission for the £2.5bn ($3.5bn) project to double capacity to 68m 
passengers a year, the current size of Heathrow airport.
The expansion has been firmly supported by the government ever since publication of its air transport white paper 
in December 2003, in spite of fierce opposition from environmental campaigners, residents' groups and the local 
authorities.
The white paper originally envisaged that the second Stansted runway, the first full length runway to be built in the 
south-east of England for more than 60 years, would be in operation by 2011-12, well ahead of a third runway at 
Heathrow, but the timetable has been gradually slipping, as opposition to the scheme has grown and the urgency of 
the need for extra capacity has diminished.
Meanwhile, passenger traffic at Stansted has been falling for more than a year. The number of passengers in 
January fell by 11.2 per cent year on year, a 19 per cent decline in two years, and BAA said last month that the 
"increased uncertainty created by current economic conditions" meant that it had put back the expected opening 
date of a second runway from 2015 to 2017.

Many pensioners who live overseas could be forced to return to the UK due to the steep rise in the cost of living 
abroad, according to financial advisers.
For the 1m British pensioners estimated to be living in a foreign country, the pound's weakness against currencies 
in popular destinations such as the US and Spain has cut the buying power of retirement income by up to a third.
Sterling's slide has coincided with falling pension and property values, which have further eaten away at the capital 
of those who have retired abroad.
Pensioners who live overseas are being advised to take advantage of cost savings where they can.
Those who use high street banks to pay pensions and mortgages overseas are often charged to move their money 
abroad. On average, overseas pensioners who use high street banks pay £780 each year in charges and 
commissions, according to Currencies Direct. Using a currency specialist, such as Currencies Direct or HiFX, can 
save 4 per cent in transfer fees and allow customers to fix the currency rate.
But even saving on money transfers might not be enough.
Low-cost air travel to provincial locations in France, Spain and Italyled to a spate of property developments nearby. 
But now some routes are being withdrawn as airlines cut costs, while other budget airlines, such as XL and Zoom, 
have gone bust.
Ryanair has postponed flights to seven new destinations in Europe, BA has cut flights from Gatwick to Geneva, and 
BMI has cut its Gatwick to Jersey service.

Ryanair to abolish check-in desks

Ryanair is planning to abolish conventional check-in facilities at airports across its European network by early next 
year, forcing all passengers to check in online before leaving their homes or offices.
Michael O'Leary said the next phase of the group's low-cost air travel revolution would be put in place at Stansted 
and Dublin airports, its biggest and most expensive bases, by the end of the year, with other airports due to follow 
in early 2010.
The Irish carrier, which is expected to overtake Lufthansa and Air France-KLM in the next couple of years to 
become the largest short-haul airline in Europe measured by passenger numbers, has transformed airline 
competition with the relentless development of the low-cost carrier business model.
Mr O'Leary said the group was launching a concerted drive to reduce its airport handling charges both for 
passengers and baggage.
At Stansted the number of check-in desks would be reduced from 50 at present to between five and 10 bag drops 
for luggage to be checked into the aircraft hold for a fee.
The airline has already been seeking to force passengers to travel only with hand baggage (restricted to a 
maximum weight of 10kgs) by charging ever higher amounts for checked-in baggage as part of the drive to cut 
airport handling charges.
Mr O'Leary said about 65 per cent of Ryanair passengers were already travelling only with carry-on baggage. 
Passengers are already restricted to only one carry-on bag and any items purchased inside the airport must also be 
packed inside the one bag.
Ryanair to abolish check-in desks
He dismissed claims that the elimination of airport check-in desks would reduce the already minimal level of 
Ryanair customer service at airports and said the airline's service was to offer the lowest fares, best punctuality and 
fewest lost bags.
He also claimed that online check-in and the printing of boarding cards represented no obstacle for the airline's 
passengers, as all customers were already forced to make their bookings online.
Mr O'Leary said the offer of the guaranteed lowest fares was allowing the airline to continue growing strongly during 
the recession with the aim of increasing passenger numbers from 58m in the year to the end of March to 67m in the 
year to March 2010.
He forecast that Ryanair's average fares would have to decline by more than 10 per cent during the next 12 months 
in order to fill the extra seats, with capacity expected to rise by 15 per cent this summer.
The group had no plans to slow the delivery of new aircraft. It was still planning to double its profits and passenger 
numbers between 2007 and 2012. He forecast a substantial improvement in profits next year from just above 
breakeven this year thanks to the big fall in oil prices.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would be one of the big winners from the recession and would continue to gain market 
share, as other carriers cut capacity or went out of business.
The airline had started negotiations with its 6,500 workforce on implementing a pay freeze coupled with improved 
productivity or, alternatively, on pay cuts for the coming financial year to the end of March.

BAA to relax its stance on Stansted

BAA is softening its opposition towards a forced sale of Stansted airport, as the long-running investigation by the 
competition watchdog into the UK airports group reaches a climax.
The Competition Commission, in its final report due early in March, is expected to call for BAA to be broken up, with 
the sale of three of its seven UK airports: Gatwick, Stansted and either Edinburgh or Glasgow.
BAA has already pre-empted the findings of the two-year probe by announcing the sale of Gatwick, the second-
largest UK airport. The process is well advanced and BAA has called for final, binding offers for Gatwick from a 
short-list of three rival consortia by March 30, with the aim of completing the sale by late May.
BAA and its majority owner, Spanish infrastructure group Ferrovial, indicated in January that they could be headed 
for a courtroom showdown with competition investigators over the calls for the additional sale of Stansted and 
Edinburgh airports, after claiming the Commission's plans would breach human rights law and European laws 
against property seizure.
The issue is delicately poised, however, and Ferrovial is anxious to avoid creating more controversy than is 
necessary with UK authorities, particularly as it has recently won government backing for its plan to build a third 
runway at Heathrow airport, by far its most important UK asset.
Ferrovial has been co-operating closely with the Commission over the Gatwick sale, even though the watchdog has 
no formal jurisdiction over the disposal, and the group is keen to examine the final details of the Commission's 
report before starting a potentially damaging appeal.
BAA to relax its stance on Stansted
It is still hopeful of winning some flexibility over the timing of the sale of Stansted, as well as over its own freedom to 
choose which of Edinburgh or Glasgow airports it should sell.
A planning inquiry is due to begin this spring into BAA's application to build a second runway at Stansted, and there 
is concern this process could be jeopardised by the demand for the airport to be sold, as the new owner will have to 
reconsider the capital spending plans.
In its provisional remedies published in December, the Commission said it would seek views on the timing of the 
sale of Stansted given the forthcoming inquiry.
The watchdog has already indicated that a second runway at Stansted may not be needed until 2017 rather than 
2015.
Traffic at Stansted, the most important airport for low-cost airlines in Europe, is being hit hard by the recession and 
in particular by the reduction of capacity during the winter months by its biggest customer, Ireland's Ryanair. 
Volumes have been falling year-on-year for 15 months in succession, undermining the timing of BAA's plans. The 
number of passengers in January fell by 11.2 per cent year-on-year to 1.29m, representing a 19 per cent decline in 
two years from 1.6m in January 2007.

Ryanair gave in-flight use of mobile phones on European airliners a significant boost on Thursday when it launched 
a service that will be rolled out across its fleet.
Several other European airlines, including Air France-KLM, TAP Air Portugal and BMI British Midland, have 
conducted trials on single aircraft, but the Irish carrier has become the first to start equipping its entire fleet, totalling 
more than 170 aircraft.
The service enables passengers to make and receive calls and text messages on their own phones, and to send 
and receive e-mails and download attachments just as they would on the ground.
The service has been launched initially on more than 20 aircraft, mainly operating out of Ryanair's Dublin base, but 
Michael O'Leary, the chief executive, said the aim was to equip the whole fleet within 18 months.
The first 50 aircraft will be fitted within six months on a trial basis, but Mr O'Leary said he was confident it would 
then be extended to the rest of the fleet. The airline currently flies about 58m passengers a year.
The service is being provided by OnAir, a company 67 per cent owned by Sita, the aviation communications group, 
and 30 per cent by Airbus, the European aircraft maker. OnAir has been leading the effort to launch in-flight mobile 
phone services against rivals such as AeroMobile, whose service is already being used by Emirates, the Dubai-
based airline, on some long-haul services.
The in-flight use of mobile phones remains controversial. Some passengers have regarded commercial aircraft as 
one of the last sanctuaries from the intrusion of ringtones and other people's irritating conversations.
Ryanair opens skies to mobile phones
However, British Airways is planning to offer in-flight mobile phone services when it launches its all-business class 
route between London City airport and New York JFK in the autumn.
Initially, it will offer only text messaging and internet access from laptops fitted with mobile phone data cards. Voice 
calls may be allowed in the future, subject to customer demand and feedback. But Willie Walsh, BA's chief 
executive, said the airline's own customer surveys showed a clear majority were still against such a move because 
of the disturbance caused to other passengers.
Under the conditions agreed with the aviation safety authorities, in-flight use of mobile phones will be possible only 
when the aircraft is flying at cruising altitudes above 10,000 feet, and the pilot will have the ability to switch off the 
service.
Ryanair said passengers would typically make and receive voice calls at non-EU international roaming rates - £1.50 
to £3 per minute, with text messages costing 40p-plus and e-mails £1-£2 from mobiles and other smartphones. 
Mr O'Leary said earnings from voice calls and text messages might remain relatively modest, but the use of mobile 
phones would eventually open up otherimportant revenue streams from activities such as gambling, entertainment 
and advertising.

Ryanair cuts 10 routes from Liverpool airport

Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, said on Wednesday it was cutting 50 jobs and scrapping 10 summer tourist 
routes from Liverpool airport because of the weak pound and rising passenger taxes.
The company said it would withdraw one of its seven aircraft from Liverpool John Lennon airport and cut services 
by 14 per cent. It expected an 8 per cent fall in passengers from 2.7m in 2008 to 2.5m this year. It blamed a £10 a 
ticket levy, which will increase by a pound this year, and a fall in Britons heading abroad because the weak sterling 
has made it expensive to do so.
Michael Cawley, deputy chief executive and chief operating officer of Ryanair, which carries almost half of 
passengers through Liverpool, one of the UK's fastest-growing airports, said: "The combination of high cost 
government air passenger duty and fall in sterling has already created a traffic collapse at Liverpool airport. The 
decision by the UK government to continue to impose high duty charges and increase them over the next two years 
is completely unacceptable given the current economic climate."
The job losses would be among cabin crew, pilots and ground staff, Mr Cawley said. Routes to three Polish cities, 
Budapest and Paris are among those cut.
Ryanair traffic grew 11 per cent in January globally, he added. "This government must realise you can only promote 
tourism by welcoming visitors not taxing them. These cuts can and will be reversed if the government's greedy air 
passenger duty is scrapped."
The news is a blow to Liverpool, in which owner Peel Holdings has invested heavily. Passenger numbers have 
grown to more than 5.5m a year and after being made last year's European Capital of Culture, the city became the 
UK's third favourite destination.
Ryanair cuts 10 routes from Liverpool airport
Easyjet also has a base there but it has struggled to attract scheduled airlines given its proximity to Manchester 
airport, the UK's largest outside London.
Next month KLM starts a thrice-daily flight to Amsterdam that will connect it to the Franco-Dutch carrier's global 
network.
The UK's regional airports face a tough year as British tourists opt to stay at home because of the recession and 
the weak pound and Ryanair's move could be repeated elsewhere.

its Dublin base.
The British long-haul airline has reduced capacity by 1-2 per cent in the winter season and said it was planning to 
reduce capacity by 7 to 10 per cent in the next 12 months.
That comes on top of freezing pay from March. Steve Ridgway, chief executive, said: "No airline is immune from the 
recession and we continue to reshape our business to ensure we're in the best position for the longer term."
In the face of falling demand, the group was taking a variety of further measures to cut costs, such as offering 
unpaid leave.
The airline said it was consulting with its 8,400 employees, including 4,500 cabin crew and 800 pilots, "about the 
possibility of up to 600 redundancies across the business". It was seeking ways to "protect as many jobs as 
possible and avoid compulsory redundancies".
Virgin Atlantic said last month it expected to make a profit in the financial year to the end of February, helped by 
earlier cost cutting and the deferral of aircraft deliveries.
Virgin and Ryanair to cut jobs
It has been running a discounted fare sale to stimulate traffic and generate cash with low fares. Mr Ridgway warned 
that the fare reductions meant lower revenues this year. "We have to reduce our costs and capacity as a result," he 
said.
Ryanair, the leading European low-cost carrier, said it was planning to make the first ever cut in operations at 
Dublin airport, one of its largest European bases, in anticipation of weaker demand.
The airline said the fall in passenger numbers would be exacerbated by Irish government plans to introduce a tax of 
EUR10 per departing passenger from March 30 and by the rising charges levied at Dublin airport.
Ryanair said it expected passenger numbers at Dublin to fall by 19 per cent to 8.7m in the next financial year to 
March 2010.
It was planning to reduce the number of aircraft based in Dublin from 22 to 18 and there would be a cut of about 
200 jobs.
The new passenger tax and higher airport fees would make Ireland a more expensive destination and render it 
uncompetitive against other parts of Europe, Ryanair said.

Airbus snubs Ryanair over discounts

Airbus has snubbed an effort by Ryanair, the low-cost airline, to draw it into a bidding contest against Boeing for the 
carrier's next multi-billion dollar order for several hundred short-haul jets.
The European aircraft maker is unwilling to contemplate the scale of discounts being sought by Ryanair, which has 
established a reputation as one of the most aggressive negotiators of low-cost supply deals in the global aviation 
industry.
Airbus's reluctance to enter the preliminary bidding for the Ryanair order is highly unusual given traditionally fierce 
competition between the world's duopoly manufacturers of big commercial jets above 100 seats.
The two group's vie for the annual bragging rights as the world's leading commercial aircraft maker - a position held 
by Airbus - and the order volumes from Ryanair, if not the profits, represent a very big prize given that the Irish 
carrier is poised to become Europe's biggest short-haul airline measured by passenger numbers.
This week Ryanair said that it was in early talks with Boeing and Airbus about an order for 300-400 short-haul jets, 
one of the biggest purchases of new aircraft.
Michael Cawley, Ryanair deputy chief executive and chief operating officer, said that he expected the group to 
place the order within 18-24 months to take advantage of the rapidly weakening commercial aerospace market.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive and key senior colleagues have visited Airbus headquarters in Toulouse 
to outline their plans, but the European group, the commercial aircraft division of EADS, has told the airline that it is 
not interested at the prices Ryanair is seeking.
Airbus snubs Ryanair over discounts
John Leahy, Airbus's chief commercial officer, said: "We are not in discussions with Ryanair about aircraft. That is 
on the record. We don't have plans to enter a sales campaign with Ryanair, which would be very expensive and 
very time consuming."
The Irish carrier is seeking to repeat its coup of six years ago, when it placed its previous biggest order for 100 
aircraft and a further 50 options in January 2002, close to the bottom of the last aviation recession.
It was the biggest order Boeing had ever received for its 737 jets, and Ryanair secured one of the largest discounts 
ever agreed by the US aircraft maker, which was then desperate for new orders.
Boeing and Airbus have said that they expect new orders to plunge this year to roughly a quarter of the peak 
combined industry level of more than 2,800 new orders won in 2007.
Ryanair has a single type fleet of 181 Boeing 737-800s. This is due to rise to 292 by March 2012, based on its 
existing firm orders.
It is looking to secure a delivery stream through the next decade to replace older jets and to allow for ongoing 
expansion.
Airbus is reluctant to enter sales campaigns that have little prospect of success.
EADS North America announced last week that it was withdrawing from the contest to supply replacement aircraft 
for the US presidential Air Force One fleet late in the next decade.

Ryanair fell heavily into loss in the three months from October to December largely due to a surge in its fuel costs.
It forecast yesterday it would return to significant profit in the next financial year to March 2010, due to the steep fall 
in the oil price in recent months and in spite of a sharp drop in average fares. Ryanair shares rose by 2.8 per cent in 
afternoon trading in Dublin to EUR2.96.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said lower fuel costs meant its current fourth quarter loss would be lower 
than expected, in spite of a 20 per cent drop in average fares. It raised its forecast for the full year to March from a 
break-even result to a net profit of EUR50m-EUR80m ($64m-$102m) before one-off charges.
It will still incur a heavy net loss this year, including exceptional items such as the writedown on the value of its 29.8 
per cent stake in bid target Aer Lingus.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would return to "substantial profitability" in the coming financial year to March 2010 thanks 
to the lower oil price and in spite of a forecast 10 per cent drop in fares.
The airline was "poised for substantial traffic and profit growth" in the coming year, as the recession forced "millions 
of passengers to focus on price", said Mr O'Leary.
The group has chosen to drive down fares in order to try to fill seats in its still growing fleet and to capture market 
share as many other airlines retrench in the face of the deepening recession.
It reported a EUR128.7m pre-tax loss for the third quarter, including exceptional charges of EUR17.3m, a big 
reverse from a pre-tax profit of EUR50.5m in the same period a year ago.
Fuel price hedge hits Ryanair
Average fares fell by 9 per cent to EUR34m as a result of a series of discounted seat sales, while fuel costs rose by 
71 per cent to EUR328m. Ryanair was hit hard by having hedged its fuel requirements for the quarter at levels well 
above the prevailing oil price in the quarter.

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, fell heavily into loss in the three months from October to December 
largely due a surge in its fuel costs.
It forecast on Monday a return to significant profit in the next financial year to March 2010, however, due to the 
steep fall in the oil price in recent months and despite a sharp drop in average fares. Ryanair shares rose by 4.8 per 
cent in afternoon Dublin trading to EUR3.01.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said lower fuel costs meant its current fourth quarter loss would be lower 
than expected, despite a 20 per cent drop in average fares. It raised its forecast for the full year to March from 
previous guidance for a break-even result to a net profit of EUR50m-EUR80m (£72m) before one-off charges.
It will still incur a heavy net loss this year, however, including exceptional items such as the big write-down on the 
value of its 29.8 per cent stake in bid target Aer Lingus.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would return to "substantial profitability" in the coming financial year to March 2010 thanks 
to the lower oil price and despite a forecast 10 per cent drop in fares.
The Irish airline was "poised for substantial traffic and profit growth" in the coming year, as the recession forced 
"millions of passengers to focus on price," said Mr O'Leary.
The group, which has recently been thwarted for a second time in a hostile bid for Aer Lingus, its smaller local rival, 
has chosen to drive down fares in order to try to fill seats in its still growing fleet and to capture market share as 
many other airlines retrench in the face of the deepening recession.
Surge in fuel costs pushes Ryanair into loss
It reported a EUR128.7m pre-tax loss for the third quarter, including exceptional charges of EUR17.3m, a big 
reverse from a pre-tax profit of EUR50.5m in the same period a year ago.
Excluding exceptional costs of EUR17.3m on 15 older aircraft to be disposed of in 2008-09 and 2009-10, adjusted 
net profit fell from EUR35m a year ago to a loss of EUR101.5m in the third quarter.
Average fares fell by 9 per cent to EUR34m as a result of long series of discounted seat sales, while fuel costs rose 
by 71 per cent to EUR328m. Ryanair was hit hard by having hedged its fuel requirements for the quarter at levels 
well above the prevailing oil price in the quarter.
Mr O'Leary said the third quarter loss was "disappointing but in line with expectations" and was largely due to the 
EUR136m rise in fuel costs.
It said "the general economic environment remains extremely difficult, as the recession saps consumer confidence." 
The downturn was helping the group to expand its traffic, however, as it benefited from its position as the lowest 
fare and lowest cost short-haul carrier in Europe.
Passenger numbers in the quarter rose by 13 per cent from 12.4m to 14m, while turnover increased by 6 per cent 
from EUR569.4m to EUR604.5m.
The group is gaining an increasing share of its turnover from ancillary revenues - including areas such as 
commission earnings on hotel, car hire and travel insurance bookings - which accounted for 22 per cent of sales in 
the quarter, up from 19 per cent a year ago. Ancillary revenues rose by 19 per cent to EUR132m.
Ryanair said it planned to launch inflight use of mobile phones at the end of February on 20 Dublin-based aircraft 
and the six-month trial should be extended to around 40 aircraft by the end of the summer.
Initial revenues would be small, but it expected inflight communications to become a "strong source" of growth in 
ancillary revenues in coming years.
Ryanair expected its financial performance in the current final quarter and next year would benefit greatly from the 
recent falls in jet fuel prices.
It had hedged 75 per cent of its fuel requirements for April to September and 50 per cent from October to December 
at an average price of $650 a tonne, which was 38 per cent lower than the average $1,050 per tonne paid in the 
current year.
If its average cost for the coming year finished at $650 per tonne, it would reduce its fuel bill by approximately 
EUR500m.
It reduced its non-fuel costs by three per cent on a per passenger basis in the third quarter thanks to improvements 
in unit costs for staff, airport and handling charges.
It said falling passenger numbers at many European airports, as rival carriers retrenched, were creating "enormous 
opportunities" for the group. Airports were being forced to compete to lower charges in order to attract further 
growth in services.
After mounting two unsuccessful takeover bids for Aer Lingus in two years the group said it was "doubtful" it would 
"waste any further management time or resources making another offer." It listed its 29.8 per cent holding under 
"available for sale financial assets."
Mr O'Leary said the rejection of its offer by the Irish government, which owns a 25 per cent stake in the airline, had 
condemned Aer Lingus "to a bleak future as a loss making, subscale, regional airline, which has a high cost base 
and declining traffic numbers." He forecast it would report substantial losses for both 2008 and 2009.
Surge in fuel costs pushes Ryanair into loss
Ryanair's results for the first nine months have already been hit by a EUR93.6m impairment charge for the fall in 
the value of its Aer Lingus stake and it warned it could be hit by a further impairment charge of EUR63.3m in the 
current quarter, if the Aer Lingus share price remained at the present level.

Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, is in early talks with Boeing and Airbus about an order for 300-400 short-
haul jets, one of the biggest ever purchases of new aircraft.
Michael Cawley, deputy chief executive and chief operating officer for Ryanair, said on Monday that he expected 
the group to place the order within 18-24 months to take advantage of the weakening commercial aerospace 
market.
The Irish carrier is seeking to repeat its coup of six years ago, when it ordered 100 aircraft and another 50 options 
in January 2002, close to the bottom of the last aviation recession.
It was the biggest order Boeing had received for its 737 jets. Ryanair secured one of the largest discounts agreed 
by the US aircraft maker, which was desperate for orders.
Both Boeing and Airbus have said they expect orders to plunge this year to about a quarter of the peak combined 
industry level of more than 2,800 orders in 2007.
Ryanair has a single type fleet of 181 Boeing 737-800s. That is due to rise to 292 by March 2012 based on existing 
firm orders. It recently exercised options for 13 more jets for delivery in 2011 and has 10 options remaining.
It is halfway through a plan to double its fleet and passenger numbers between 2007 and 2012. Passenger volumes 
are scheduled to grow from 43m in the year to March 2007 to 87m in the year to March 2012, when Ryanair will 
have become the biggest short-haul carrier in Europe.
Ryanair in talks over ordering 400 jets
The potential order will trigger a fierce contest between Boeing and Airbus. Mr Cawley said that, given the airline's 
size, the group would be happy to move to a mixed Airbus/Boeing fleet.
In the last downturn EasyJet wrung big price concessions out of Airbus to switch from an all-Boeing fleet. The 
strategies of Ryanair and EasyJet are diverging sharply, however.
EasyJet, the leading UK low-cost airline, is seeking to slow its growth and has clauses in its Airbus contract to defer 
half its deliveries up to two years.

Michael O'Leary is keeping the throttle wide open in spite the deepening recession.
The Ryanair chief executive is sticking to his tried and tested formula of making a big grab for market share in a 
downturn, while EasyJet, his main low-cost airline rival in Europe, is becoming ever more cautious about fleet 
expansion.
As his competitors retrench - or go out of business altogether - Mr O'Leary believes Ryanair's unchallenged position 
as the lowest cost, lowest fares operator in Europe will allow it to continue to grow.
Michael Cawley, Ryanair's deputy chief executive and chief operating officer, said on Monday that the airline was in 
early talks with Boeing and Airbus about a big order for 300-400 more aircraft to be placed in the next 18-24 
months. Ryanair's current delivery stream ends in 2012.
The airline is adamant that there is still huge scope for expansion, as new markets open in Europe and rivals are 
shouldered aside.
Mr Cawley said the group was expecting continued strong growth in continental Europe in coming years - 
particularly in Italy, Spain and Scandinavia, where local airlines are being forced to consolidate and retrench. 
Ryanair has established 31 operating bases in Europe to date.
The airline said on Monday that it had fallen into loss in the three months from October to December, largely owing 
to a surge in its fuel costs in that period.
O'Leary keeps throttle wide open
Ryanair reported a EUR128.7m ($165m) pre-tax loss for the third quarter, including exceptional charges of 
EUR17.3m, a big reverse from a pre-tax profit of EUR50.5m in the same period a year ago. It was hit hard by 
having hedged its fuel requirements for the quarter at levels well above the prevailing oil price in the three months.
The company raised its guidance for the full year from a break-even result to a net profit of EUR50m-EUR80m 
before one-off charges. The final-quarter results would be better than expected owing to lower fuel costs and in 
spite of a 20 per cent fall in average fares.
The company will still incur a heavy net loss for the full year, however, when including exceptional items such as a 
big writedown on the value of its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
Mr O'Leary said the third-quarter loss was "disappointing but in line with expectations" and was largely because of 
the EUR136m rise in fuel costs.
He added that Ryanair would return to "substantial profitability" in the financial year to March 2010, thanks to the 
lower oil price and in spite of a forecast 10 per cent drop in fares.
It was "poised for substantial traffic and profit growth" in the coming year as the recession forced "millions of 
passengers to focus on price", he said.

My prediction at the beginning of the year - that our client base would increasingly be from continental Europe - has 
proved prophetic. While in the second millennium London was the Krug and caviar capital of Europe in terms of 
property prices, it is now more like a mid-range pizzeria for anyone who wants to cash in their euros and consider 
buying.
I spent last weekend celebrating the soixante-neuf (their combined ages) of my friends Emily and Harold, who own 
the best hotel on the Breton coast, the Grand Hôtel des Bains. It's a wonderful place with 30 rooms all decorated in 
a minimally chic New England manner, a spa, sea views and the most delicious food. It was the obvious venue in 
which to entertain 60 of their friends.
All of the guests hailed from Paris or London. The British party, which included me, suffered the indignity of 
travelling by Ryanair. While my fellow FT columnist Tyler Brûlé spends his inches discussing the finer points of first-
class travel, I'm reduced to reporting on the horrors of a budget airline (though I am still shameless when it comes 
to hitching lifts on Big Daddy's private jet). I vowed to never again fly Ryanair after a particularly hideous flight to 
Cork seven years ago but I relented last weekend for practical purposes. One of the many heinous things about the 
airline is the stealth taxes they add; you pay to check in, you pay for your bags ... I thought I might be asked to hand 
over a couple of euros when I went to use the aircraft's lavatory. They play incessant digitalised music that would 
drive a two-year-old to dementia and the interiors of the planes are a visual assault on the senses.
And don't get me started on the Ryanair staff on the ground at Dinard airport - petty, belligerent and frankly 
inhuman. Some guests were prevented from boarding their return flight even though they were at the airport an 
hour before the plane took off and one had a connecting flight to catch to Shanghai.
But all this was thankfully neutralised by the pleasure of the weekend - champagne, oysters, spa treatments, 
lobster, Daphne du Maurier-esque walks along the inspiring Brittany coast-line, stylish Parisians, more champagne, 
The Secret Agent: When on the continent ...
black-tie dinners, superb company, crêpes à l'exterieur in the sunshine overlooking the sea, dancing, yet more 
champagne, sea bathing and the best hosts imaginable. I would gladly take another dozen more Ryanair flights to 
relive it all again.
Among the Parisians was a beautiful pair, a man and woman in their mid-20s, who remained shrouded in enigma 
as the British guests speculated whether they were lovers, siblings, best friends or all three. They are both actors 
and he had just played the cross-dressing lead in an Eric Rohmer film - so very French. They are moving to London 
and the Thesp will be sure to find them a suitable flat to rent - somewhere perhaps in Covent Garden, close to their 
new agent and casting directors who will, inevitably, fall at their feet.
Surprisingly they were without ego and as I danced the night away in our newly formed ménage à trois, recreating 
Truffaut's Jules et Jim, it took me back to my own French dancing days at Les Bains Douche night club, where I 
spent many a night in my gap year. I wasn't so fond of the Parisians in those days but now I am a convert. They can 
be impossibly arrogant but they do have a certain style, a certain allure.
The other thing I observed is that the French all seem to smoke, while I'm the only British person I know who is still 
partial to the odd puff. Another French couple I met while sharing a cigarette under the stars (it's a great unifier, the 
smoking business) want to buy in London. Of course, they want to be in South Kensington or as they more correctly 
pronounced it "sud de Kensington", since it's largely colonised by their compatriots. It appears Parisian prices have 
rocketed in the past three years and although they are coming down now, Paris is no longer the poor cousin to 
London.
So, as we creep into 2009, my client base is 80 per cent European and 20 per cent American, without any active 
British buyers for the moment. I expect that the developers who sold in 2007 will soon be ready to return to the 
market and snap up a bargain. But until then it will simply mean more European weekends away - for business as 
much as for pleasure.

Dublin grounds Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus

The Irish government on Thursday said it would not support Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus, scuppering the low-cost 
airline's hostile approach to take over its smaller rival.
The government, which owns 25 per cent of Aer Lingus, said Ryanair's EUR1.40 a share all-cash offer, which 
valued the airline at EUR748m (£701m), "greatly undervalues Aer Lingus and a merger on the basis proposed 
would be likely to have a significant negative impact on competition in the market".
Noel Dempsey, transport minister, said: "Because we live on an island, Irish consumers depend heavily on air 
transport. A monopoly in this areas would not be in the best interests of Irish consumers.
"The offer by Ryanair did not include any proposed remedies for the virtual monopoly that would result if the offer 
was accepted."
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, conceded the offer was dead. "We respect that decision," he said.
"It means our offer won't be successful since our 90 per cent acceptance condition can't be satisfied. Sadly it 
means the government won't receive EUR200m, and there won't be a 1,000 new jobs created in Aer Lingus over 
the next five years."
Earlier in the day, Mr O'Leary indicated the company might raise its offer above EUR1.40 a share, but any increase 
would have been "small and not the crazy and silly expectations being put out there by some analysts".
Dublin grounds Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus
John Mattimoe of Merrion Stockbrokers described the Ryanair offer as "clearly not high enough", and said a price of 
EUR2.07-EUR2.67 a share would have had "a realistic chance of engaging the target board in meaningful 
discussions".
An unsuccessful bid in October 2006 priced at EUR2.80 a share was rejected by shareholders and deemed 
anticompetitive by the European Commission, which ruled the merger would "have harmed consumers by removing 
this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties".

Aer Lingus, the Irish carrier, and United Airlines, the third biggest US airline, are launching a new service between 
Madrid and Washington, in one of the first deals to take advantage of the March 2007 EU-US open skies trade 
liberalisation agreement.
The daily service, with Aer Lingus providing the Airbus 8-330 aircraft and crews and United handling the sales and 
marketing, will start in March next year.
Both airlines expect tickets for additional routes to be on sale during 2010, with services commencing in summer 
2011.
Aer Lingus, which is currently the target for a hostile takeover bid from Ryanair, the rival Irish low fares carrier, said 
the partnership may develop into a "broader and deeper joint venture."
Both airlines said the agreement "will capitalise on the growth opportunities presented by open skies" a 
breakthrough trade deal which US and EU airlines to fly transatlantic to any airport in either market. Hitherto routes 
were agreed by governments on a bilateral basis.
The agreement builds on their existing code-sharing deal, which took effect from November. Under the new 
partnership passenger check-in at Madrid or Washington will carry both companies' logos. There is no decision yet 
on the livery of the aircraft. At the press conference on Thursday, a model carrying both airlines' colours was used.
Meanwhile, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, indicated he may be ready to increase the EUR1.40 a share 
all cash offer for Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus and United plan trans-Atlantic service
The offer is due to lapse on February 13. Ryanair has until January 30 to amend the terms.
Mr O'Leary said any increase in the price "will be small and not the crazy and silly expectations being put out there 
last week by some analysts."
John Mattimoe of Merrion Stockbrokers, last week suggested an offer in the range EUR2.07-EUR2.67 would have 
"a realistic chance of engaging the target board in meaningful discussions."
The Irish government retains a 25 per cent blocking stake following Aer Lingus' privatisation in 2006. In addition, an 
employee share ownership trust (ESOT) owns 14.3 per cent.
On the first date for acceptances around 0.01 per cent of shareholders - excluding Ryanair - had taken up the offer.
An earlier bid in October 2006 - priced at EUR2.80 a share - was rejected by shareholders and deemed anti-
competitive by the European Commission. Brussels ruled the merger would "have harmed consumers by removing 
this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties."
Aer Lingus says Ryanair has not made clear what it would do to preserve competition.
However the collapse of the deal seems certain to see the Aer Lingus share price fall back. Mr O'Leary predicted if 
the Ryanair offer was not taken up, the Aer Lingus share price, which was up 3 cents in morning trading at 
EUR1.42, would drop "probably below EUR1."

Ryanair has called for an extraordinary meeting of Aer Lingus shareholders aimed at blocking recent changes 
agreed by Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus chief executive, in his employment contract, writes Kevin Done.
Ryanair, which is pursuing a hostile takeover bid for its smaller Irish rival, said Mr Mannion's employment contract 
had been amended earlier this year.
Under the changes he would be entitled to claim up to EUR2.8m (£2.5m) should he decide to resign following a 
change of control in the company.
That claim could be made even if new owners were happy for him to continue in office, as Ryanair said would be 
the case if its bid was successful.
Ryanair said it had extended its EUR1.40 a share takeover offer to February 13. It had received only a tiny number 
of acceptances by Monday's first deadline, with only 0.1 per cent of shareholders backing the offer in addition to 
Ryanair itself, which already holds a stake of 29.82 per cent.
Analysts said that they expected Ryanair would now be forced to raise its bid.

Aer Lingus launches spirited Ryanair defence

Aer Lingus on Monday issued a spirited defence against rival Ryanair saying its  EUR1.40 a share cash bid was "a 
rip-off". It said it would make a small pre-tax profit in 2008 and insisted it had a "vibrant independent future".
The defence document is the latest round in a lively battle between the two Irish carriers.
In a letter to shareholders, Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus, showed he could be as outspoken as Mr 
O'Leary, accusing Ryanair of issuing "threats, contradictions and insinuations". He said a takeover would create a 
monopoly in the Irish Republic, which would "flatter to deceive and give meaningless guarantees." He urged 
shareholders to take no action in order to defeat the bid.
In the letter, Mr Barrington asserted that while the global airline industry as a whole was expected to make a $5bn 
loss for 2008, "we expect to achieve profit overall in 2008".
Just last month the group said it was heading for a EUR20m operating loss for this year, but on Monday the group 
said its interest income on its cash should generate a profit before tax and exceptional items.
It had previously predicted further operating losses in 2009. However, it has since done a deal with its unions on 
cost cuts designed to save EUR50m a year and benefited from falling fuel prices, allowing Mr Barrington to say that 
the group would "continue to enhance profitability in 2009 and beyond".
Aer Lingus had proved it could compete successfully both with major flag carriers and low-cost operators, such as 
Ryanair, he said. Ryanair, by contrast, had no experience of managing a long-haul business such as Aer Lingus' 
transatlantic routes, or offering superior customer service.
Aer Lingus launches spirited Ryanair defence
Mr Barrington said Aer Lingus had net cash of EUR803m, with total cash reserves of EUR1.3bn when debt - 
including aircraft leases - were excluded.
Ryanair's bid values the whole of Aer Lingus' equity at nearly EUR750m, but with Ryanair already holding a 29.8 
per cent stake, it would need to pay only EUR525m for the remaining 70.2 per cent. Mr Barrington said in the letter 
that Ryanair would gain access to the EUR1.3bn by paying EUR525m - adding, "for this reason alone the offer is 
worthy of rejection".
He said Aer Lingus' fleet of aircraft was worth EUR601m, while it had further value in its slots at Heathrow, its 
market position and brand.
As well as launching the defence document, Aer Lingus announced it was re-opening its route between Shannon, in 
the west of Ireland, and London's Heathrow airport which it axed last year causing a political furore. Ryanair had 
said if its bid was successful it would re-open the route.
Last week Aer Lingus announced it would begin a number of routes from London's Gatwick airport next spring, 
taking up slots no longer needed by British Airways and others.
In lunchtime trading on Monday, Aer Lingus shares were up 0.02 at EUR1.46, staying above the EUR1.40 offer 
price, while Ryanair's fell 0.03 to EUR3.02.

Aer Lingus to set up base at Gatwick

Body
Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier fighting a hostile takeover bid by Ryanair, is launching its first base outside the Irish 
Republic and Northern Ireland at London's Gatwick airport.
The move into Gatwick is a strategic gamble by the group, which is seeking to demonstrate it can survive and 
expand as an independent carrier without taking part in the wave of consolidation in European aviation.
It is also taking advantage of retrenchments at the UK's second-largest airport by British Airways, which is 
consolidating its operations at Heathrow, its global hub, and is shrinking at Gatwick.
Aer Lingus has reached a deal with BA to utilise some of the take-off and landing slots BA no longer needs. It has 
also picked up others from the small pool of free slots, which has been increased by the collapse of carriers 
previously flying to the airport, such as XL Airways, Zoom Airlines and Sterling Airlines.
BA has announced it is withdrawing four aircraft from Gatwick in the next summer season - three short-haul and 
one long-haul - cutting its departures by about 15 per cent.
Between the summer seasons of 2001 and 2009, BA will have cut its number of take-off and landing slots at 
Gatwick by 45 per cent.
Its share of slots at the airport has dropped from 40 per cent in 2001 to 20 per cent, as other carriers have taken 
advantage of its retrenchment, led by EasyJet, which controls 26 per cent of the Gatwick slots and has established 
its biggest base in Europe at the airport.
Aer Lingus to set up base at Gatwick
Flybe, European's leading regional airline in which BA holds a 15 per cent stake, is also growing and has gained a 
9 per cent share of the Gatwick slots.
Aer Lingus, which opened its first base outside the Irish Republic at Belfast early this year, said it would launch the 
Gatwick base in April with routes to Zurich, Munich, Vienna, Malaga, Faro, Nice and Knock in addition to the 
existing Gatwick/Dublin service.
Dermot Mannion, chief executive, said the group planned to base four Airbus A320 short-haul jets at Gatwick from 
April next year and would double the fleet to eight from summer 2010.
Mr Mannion said the Gatwick base offered Aer Lingus a "unique opportunity to establish a significant foothold in 
one of the biggest aviation markets in the world".
The move by Aer Lingus into Gatwick provides support for BAA, the owner, which is seeking to sell the airport and 
has lost several carriers through bankruptcies and the transfer of flights to Heathrow.
Aer Lingus is expected to issue its defence document against the hostile Ryanair takeover bid next week.
Aer Lingus shares closed up slightly at EUR1.44.

British Airways may be the world's "favourite airline". But it is certainly not the world's biggest. That is the main 
reason why its merger talks with Qantas collapsed. Yes, the technical complications of an Anglo-Antipodean tie-up 
would have been horrendous. But complexity alone did not break the deal. Rather it was an old-fashioned M&A 
struggle. The Australian airline sought majority ownership. It also wanted the executive board to sit in Sydney. BA 
said no. End of deal.
So it is back to the drawing board for global airline consolidation, for now. Qantas may pursue Asian deals from 
home. Meanwhile Willie Walsh, BA's chief executive, has a wide array of options sketched out on his own office 
jotter pad. There is still the possibility of an Iberia deal, a combination with American Airlines someday, perhaps a 
white knight rescue of Aer Lingus (Walsh's former posting) from Ryanair, even a strategic stake in Alitalia. Yet this 
hodgepodge of ven diagrams is as much a vision of Mr Walsh's overactive mind as of how busy the airline world 
has become.
BA sits in the middle of an industry consolidating into a vicious downturn. Regulators are allowing deals they would 
never have countenanced before. None of these deals are mutually exclusive. All are potentially value creating. As 
one sign of that, since the BA/Qantas talks went public, their share prices, and Iberia's too, have outperformed the 
sector. The main question is how the combinations are sequenced.
Regional consolidation, as an irritated Iberia said when BA announced it was talking to Qantas, is the logical first 
step: Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have already cleared the way. It is the path of least geographical and 
regulatory resistance. It also offers the most value. Synergies from a BA/Iberia merger could total £400m a year. 
That is more than twice that available from a Qantas deal, estimates Collins Stewart. Looked at another way, taxed 
and capitalised, it is equivalent to £2.8bn, or three quarters of the groups' combined market capitalisation. Focus

Ryanair, European largest low fares airline, on Wednesday won a legal victory in its long-running battle with 
Brussels over its subsidised access to Charleroi airport in southern Belgium.
The Court of First Instance, one of the top European courts, annulled a decision by the European Commission 
which had declared that assistance given to Ryanair, to encourage it to operate out of the airport, constituted illegal 
state aid.
The assistance was given by the Walloon Region, which owns the airport, and the publicly-owned Brussels South 
Charleroi Airport, and dates back to negotiations eight years ago.
The court's decision was largely technical: it ruled that the Commission had been wrong to refuse to consider 
together the advantages granted by the Walloon Region and the BSCA, and also not to have applied the principle 
of the private investor in a market economy to the measures adopted by the Walloon Region.
Nevetheless, Ryanair seized on the decision, claiming that it "clarifies that the low-cost airports model works and 
does not involve state aid". The airline urged the Commission to dismiss complaints involving other secondary 
airports.
The ruling comes as Ryanair is renewing efforts to acquire rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus, a move which was previous 
blocked by Brussels on competition grounds.

Body
Ryanair, European largest low fares airline, won a landmark victory on Wednesday in its long-running battle with the 
European Commission over airport charges.
The European Court of First Instance, one of the top courts in Europe, upheld the airline's appeal against the 
decision in 2004 by the European Commission to block its deal on low cost airport charges and marketing support 
at Belgium's Charleroi airport.
The Commission had claimed the deals constituted state aid for the Irish airline, which was incompatible with the 
common market, and requested Belgium to recover the alleged subsidies.
In a big setback for the Brussels authorities, the Court said the Commission had failed to apply the principle of "the 
private investor in a market economy" in assessing the measures taken by the Walloon Region, the owner of the 
airport, to encourage Ryanair to expand its activities at Charleroi.
Ryanair had entered into two agreements, one with the Walloon region, the owner of Charleroi airport, and the other 
with the airport itself.
The Walloon region granted Ryanair a reduction of 50 per cent on landing charges from the regulatory level and 
undertook to compensate the airline for any loss of profit arising from any subsequent change in airport charges.
Under the second deal Ryanair agreed to base between two and four aircraft at Charleroi and to operate over a 15-
year period at least three return flights a day per aircraft.
Ryanair wins Belgian airport victory
The airport also agreed to contribute to the costs incurred by Ryanair in establishing the base and to invoice the 
airline one euro per passenger for the provision of ground handling services, rather than the 10 euros collected for 
those services from other users.
The airline argued at the time that the terms of the deal were available to any carrier, that was prepared to enter 
into a similar deal and that it was not exclusively available to Ryanair.
The airline said the court's decision was "a vindication of Charleroi airport's business plan, which has resulted in a 
thriving and profitable competitor to the high cost Brussels Zaventem Airport."
Ryanair called on the Commission to drop its similar cases against a number of other airports used by the group 
including Alghero, Aarhus, Bratislava, Frankfurt-Hahn, Luebeck, Pau, Berlin Schoenefeld and Tampere.
It said Brussels should focus instead on "real and blatant breaches" of the state aid rules by Europe's flag carriers 
including "the most recent illegal bailout" of Alitalia by the Italian government, and the EUR500m state aid granted 
by the Austrian government to Lufthansa as a "sweetener" to encourage it to buy Austrian Airlines.
Jim Callaghan, Ryanair legal affairs director said, the group was "delighted" with the Court's decision.
Charleroi had been the model for how small regional and secondary airports around Europe could transform 
themselves from" unused, loss-making facilities into profitable commercial entities."
Charleroi had proven in the past four years that its model worked.
"They have built a new low cost terminal, based on the success of their agreement with Ryanair, and other airlines 
have arrived in Charleroi as a result. The airport has been profitable each year for the past four years, which 
disproves the Commission's claims they would be loss making for the term of the Ryanair contract," said Mr 
Callaghan.
"Today's decision now clarifies that the low cost airports model works and does not involve state aid."
The ruling comes as Ryanair is renewing efforts to acquire rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus, a move which was previous 
blocked by Brussels on competition grounds.

BA and Virgin Atlantic reduce surcharges

Body
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are making significant reductions in the fuel surcharges imposed on passenger 
fares several months after the steep fall in crude oil prices began to lower their fuel costs.
The crude oil price surged to a peak of $147 a barrel in July threatening the survival of many carriers but has since 
more than halved falling to a four-year low of $40.50 earlier this month. Crude oil was trading on Wednesday close 
to $40 a barrel in New York.
Both carriers reduced the fuel surcharges levied on economy and premium economy fares for long-haul flights in 
October but left the surcharges on long-haul business class and in BA's case also on short-haul fares unchanged.
BA said it was lowering the surcharges on long-haul fares from Wednesday by as much as a third. The move 
reflected the reduction in the oil price and its fuel hedging policy for 2009-10.
In the first six months of the current financial year from April to September, BA's fuel costs rose by 52 per cent to 
£1.49bn and it has forecast the fuel bill for the full year to March will rise by £1bn to around £3bn.
The weakness of the pound against the US dollar, the currency used in oil trading, has reduced the advantage of 
the lower oil price and BA has also derived less benefit because more than half of its fuel requirements are still 
hedged at higher prices. It said last month it had only hedged 40 per cent of its requirements for 2009-10 to take 
advantage of the lower prices.
Other carriers including Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have moved more quickly to lower their surcharges and BA 
has come under sustained attack from Ryanair, the Irish low cost airline, for its delay in lowering the fuel levies.
BA and Virgin Atlantic reduce surcharges
BA said it was reducing the surcharge on long-haul economy fares for flights over nine hours by £30 to £66 per 
one-way flight. On flights of less than nine hours, the surcharge would be reduced by £15 per sector to £53.
For long-haul business and first class flights over nine hours the surcharges would be reduced by £35 per sector 
(one-way flight) to £98 (or £196 return), and by £20 to £78 on shorter flights.
On domestic and European short-haul services, surcharges would be reduced by £4 to £12 per sector in economy 
and by £5 to £15 per sector in business class.
The reductions announced by Virgin Atlantic, which only operates long-haul services, were identical to those made 
by BA.
BA is currently forecasting a small profit for the current year down from a record  operating profit of £875m in the 12 
months to March.
BA was fined a record £121.5m by the Office of Fair Trading in August last year after admitting illegally colluding 
with Virgin Atlantic on the fixing of fuel surcharges on long-haul flights to and from the UK during the period from 
August 2004 to January 2006.
BA admitted it had discussed the level of the surcharges with Virgin Atlantic on at least six occasions.
Virgin Atlantic avoided paying any penalty after qualifying for leniency by being the first to give the OFT full details 
of the two airlines' illegal activity.

Body
Ryanair has been told by the Irish takeover panel it broke stock exchange rules in its negotiations to win Irish 
government backing for its EUR1.40-a-share hostile bid for Aer Lingus, the Irish rival airline, announced earlier this 
month.
The panel said the promises Ryanair made to the government, a 25 per cent shareholder in Aer Lingus, should 
have been offered to all shareholders of the former state airline.
The panel said it was "prohibiting [Ryanair] from extending these undertakings".
Ryanair's offer document, which is expected to be sent to shareholders in the next few days, will now have to be 
amended to accommodate the panel's comments, lawyers said.
But one broker said: "I don't see this weakening Ryanair's proposal."
Ryanair's all-cash bid values its smaller rival at EUR748m (£669m), although brokers point out this is less than Aer 
Lingus's net cash of EUR767m.
Following discussions with Noel Dempsey, the Irish transport minister, Ryanair promised to "commit [to] and 
guarantee" Aer Lingus's longstanding policy of trade union recognition. This is an important issue for staff who 
through a employee shareholder trust, or ESOT, own a 14.4 per cent stake.
The Shannon-Heathrow service, which the current Aer Lingus management scrapped last year causing a political 
furore in the west of Ireland, would be restored under the bid terms.
Ryanair rapped over Aer Lingus bid
Ryanair, which owns 29.8 per cent of Aer Lingus, also gave what it called a "legally binding guarantee" not to sell, 
transfer, lease or switch the Aer Lingus take-off and landing slots at Heathrow without the approval of the Irish 
transport minister. In addition it offered a EUR200m bank guarantee to drop fares and eliminate Aer Lingus fuel 
surcharges.
Aer Lingus on Friday said it was scrapping the fuel surcharge on long-haul flights "in line with movements in fuel 
prices."
Aer Lingus shares closed up 1 cent at EUR1.50. Ryanair closed down 12 cents at EUR2.92.
Ryanair tabled a EUR2.80 a share bid in late 2006 but it was rejected by the government and the ESOT. It was also 
deemed to be in breach of European Union competition rules.

Aer Lingus will return to profit next year thanks to deep cost cuts agreed in recent days with its trade unions and the 
steep fall in fuel prices, Sean Coyle, chief financial officer, said on Thursday.
The Irish flag carrier is under attack from Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, which last week launched its 
second hostile bid for the airline in two years.
Mr Coyle said the package of cost cuts and productivity measures, which had raised the threat of industrial action, 
had been backed in union ballots and would secure the full EUR74m (£66m, $99m) of annual cost savings sought 
by the airline.
Sweeping reforms of working practices among ground services staff and cabin crew had been agreed and would 
bring savings of EUR50m, including a reduction of up to 400 jobs from a workforce of 4,100.
In return for the reforms the airline has agreed to drop its own plan to outsource about 1,300 jobs in ground services 
and to start employing new groups of cabin crew recruited in the US on many of its Ireland/US routes.
Colm Barrington and Dermot Mannion, respectively chairman and chief executive, met Noel Dempsey, Irish 
transport minister, to press for government support to oppose the Ryanair bid. The state holds a 25 per cent stake 
in Aer Lingus and Ryanair holds 29.8 per cent.
Mr Mannion said after the meeting: "Ryanair cannot spin away the fact that Aer Lingus is and will continue to be its 
fiercest competitor into and out of Ireland.
Aer Lingus chief vows a return to the black
"It is offering other Aer Lingus shareholders a mere EUR525m, a pathetic sum in the context of the EUR1.3bn in 
cash on the group's balance sheet, the substantial value of our fleet and the value of the Heathrow slots. Aer Lingus 
remains a strong business with significant cash reserves and a robust long-term future."
Aer Lingus said the Ryanair offer was "an effort to eliminate competition in the Irish market place".
Ryanair's first bid two years ago was blocked by the European competition authorities.
It said last week it planned to merge the two carriers into "one strong Irish airline group under common ownership".
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said last week that the competitive landscape had changed since the first 
rejection.

Colm Barrington is on a mission. The new chairman of Aer Lingus fired the first salvo on Thursday in his campaign 
to refute the "big lies" he claims are being told about his airline by Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive.
Ryanair launched last week its second hostile bid in two years for its smaller Irish rival. And in contrast to many of 
his previous battles, Mr O'Leary might have found an opponent more than willing to trade blows.
Mr Barrington, a leading offshore yachtsman, is a grandee of the Irish aviation industry, which has supplied senior 
managers at some of the world's biggest airlines, including British Airways and Qantas. Some 15 years older than 
Mr O'Leary, Mr Barrington knows his rival well from their days working for Tony Ryan, whose company, GPA, 
invented and became the world leader in aircraft leasing in the 1980s.
Mr Barrington is now chief executive of Babcock & Brown Air, a New York-listed and Irish-based aircraft leasing 
group, and was appointed chairman of Aer Lingus in September.
Mr O'Leary has named his former colleague as the only Aer Lingus board member he would want to keep on. 
Nevertheless, Mr Barrington is determined to block Ryanair's ambitions to swallow Aer Lingus along with its pile of 
net cash and take an unchallenged position in the Irish market.
"Mr O'Leary wants ... to get EUR800m (£710m, $1.065bn) net cash into his own bank," Mr Barrington says, before 
adding that the deal would not benefit "the 4m Irish people that have a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus through the 
government's holding. It is not a good deal for anyone except Mr O'Leary and Ryanair."
The latest Ryanair offer of EUR1.40 a share is half its bid in October 2006, but still a 25 per cent premium to the 
closing price of EUR1.12 before the bid was launched.
Chairman targets O'Leary 'lies'
Mr Barrington, though, says a deal would leave Ryanair "in control of about 80 per cent of all air travel in and out of 
Ireland. It would have a totally monopolistic position."
He attacks Ryanair's pledge to cut Aer Lingus fares by 5 per cent for three years as "a meaningless promise". Aer 
Lingus short-haul fares are already nearly 7 per cent lower than in 2007, he claims, and are expected to fall a 
similar amount in 2009.
He also dismisses a Ryanair promise to remove Aer Lingus fuel surcharges on long-haul fares. Such offers are 
"easily given" when the oil price has fallen below $50 a barrel.
Aer Lingus is owned 29.8 per cent by Ryanair, 25 per cent by the state and about 18 per cent by employee 
interests.
Mr Barrington is sceptical about Mr O'Leary's offer to guarantee trade union recognition for Aer Lingus's heavily 
unionised workforce. Such recognition is already secured in Irish law in a company being acquired.
Mr O'Leary's need for government support for his bid means he is presenting "a new face, a benign, loving and 
cuddly Michael O'Leary, rather than the aggressive Michael O'Leary we have known and loved for 20 years," Mr 
Barrington says.
He dismisses Mr O'Leary's claim that Aer Lingus is a failing airline "tottering from crisis to crisis" as the "big lie, you 
cannot believe anything Ryanair says. If people believe it, they are really naive."
If you believe Mr Barrington Aer Lingus has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, with gross cash of 
EUR1.3bn and net cash of EUR800m. It has made profits, it has generated cash, it has a modern fleet and has 
expanded its network.
His words show the airline is not going to give up without a fight.

Air traffic fell sharply last month, registering the biggest decline since November 2001, when the 9/11 terrorist 
attacks in the US helped to plunge global aviation into recession.
Passenger numbers at BAA's seven UK airports fell by 8.9 per cent in November year-on-year from 10.8m to 9.8m - 
by far the steepest such annual decline since traffic began to weaken in April. The pace of the drop has been 
accelerating since September.
As well as passenger numbers at the airports, the volume of flights moving through UK airspace is in sharp decline 
as airlines cut their schedules and ground aircraft to try to bring capacity more into line with falling demand for air 
travel.
Nats, the air traffic control service, said November, the first full month of the winter travel schedules, had shown a 
9.8 per cent decrease in the number of flights it had handled from 188,000 to 169,500.
The steep fall in passenger numbers is hitting BAA just as it is trying to sell Gatwick airport. It could soon be facing 
a demand from the Competition Commission to dispose as well of Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh 
airports in order to improve competition.
Traffic at Gatwick fell by 13.5 per cent year-on-year in November. The airport has been hit by the recent collapse of 
several carriers including Zoom Airlines, XL Airways and Denmark's Sterling Airlines.
It has also suffered in particular from the transfer of a large number of its US long-haul services to Heathrow as a 
result of the US/European Union "open skies" treaty.
Air passenger numbers drop 8.9%
Both American Airlines and Continental Airlines have closed their Gatwick bases, and British Airways has 
transferred several US long-haul services from Gatwick to Heathrow.
BAA said Heathrow, the busiest airport in Europe measured by passenger numbers, was proving the most resilient 
of its UK airports to the deepening recession with a fall of 4.8 per cent partly because of its greater share of the 
stronger long-haul markets.
By contrast Stansted, the most important airport in Europe for low-cost airlines, suffered a fall of 13.2 per cent under 
the impact in particular of the cut in flights by Ireland's Ryanair. The carrier has grounded 15 aircraft at the airport 
for a large part of the winter to eliminate loss-making routes.
Monthly traffic numbers at Stansted have been falling for 13 months in succession year-on-year, but the drop in 
November was by far the steepest decline.
Passenger numbers at Glasgow fell by 15.6 per cent in November, the sharpest drop of any BAA airport, with 
numbers at the Scottish airports, including Edinburgh and Aberdeen, declining by 11.5 per cent.
Volumes at the three London airports Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted  fell by 8.4 per cent overall.
Many airlines that have already reduced capacity for the winter are also preparing to reduce flights in the next 
summer season. British Airways, for example, is due to remove four more aircraft from its Gatwick operations, 
cutting departures at the airport by 15 per cent. Ground staff there are being reduced by 8 per cent.

A second runway at London Stansted airport will not be built until the second half of the next decade at the earliest, 
it emerged on Tuesday.
The Civil Aviation Authority, airport economic regulator, has followed recommendations from the Competition 
Commission to exclude the £2.3bn ($3.4bn) project at Stansted from the price control regime for the next five years 
to March 2014.
The CAA's decision means BAA, Stansted's owner, will have no funding from higher charges to finance 
development work until a new price regime is introduced in six years.
The competition watchdog last month questioned the urgency of the expansion at Stansted against a background of 
"deteriorating economic and financial conditions". Monthly traffic volumes at the UK's third-largest airport have been 
falling year on year for 12 months in succession.
The Competition Commission said its traffic forecasts indicated a second runway would not be needed until 2017 at 
the earliest, two years later than proposed by BAA.
A planning inquiry is due next year into BAA's proposal to build the second runway and a second terminal. The 
inquiry could be derailed, however, by a change of ownership of the airport. The commission is separately 
investigating the structure of BAA and has provisionally recommended the break-up of the group's airport 
monopolies in London and Scotland, including the sale of Stansted. BAA has already started the process to sell 
Gatwick.
Plan for Stansted second runway slips back
The CAA said on Tuesday it was proposing to freeze charges - the per passenger levy on airlines - in real terms at 
Stansted for both 2009-10 and 2010-11. It proposed small increases of 1.6 per cent above inflation in the 
subsequent three years, taking the charge to £6.65 per passenger in 2013-14.
BAA said it was "disappointed" that a significant element of its spending to date on preparing for expansion at 
Stansted had thus been ruled out. "We will continue to press for a regulatory framework which reflects the full cost 
of bringing forward the second runway proposals at Stansted," it said.
However, the CAA proposals were welcomed by Ryanair and EasyJet, the biggest operators at the airport, which 
have been campaigning hard to keep charges and capital spending at the airport in check. "Keeping prices broadly 
flat over the coming years should ensure consumers continue to be protected from BAA's worst monopolistic 
excesses," said EasyJet.
The CAA said it would also impose a service quality rebate scheme at Stansted similar to those at Heathrow and 
Gatwick with financial penalties - up to 7 per cent of charges - if BAA failed to meet agreed standards.

Ryanair sweetened its takeover bid for Aer Lingus on Thursday night in a concerted effort to win the support of the 
Irish government.
The state owns a 25 per cent stake and is the largest shareholder after Ryanair itself, which holds 29.8 per cent. Its 
backing is crucial if Ryanair is to gain majority control following the launch on Monday of its second hostile takeover 
bid for the carrier in two years. The government strongly opposed the first bid in October 2006.
Ryanair said last night that it would give the government full control over Aer Lingus's take-off and landing slots at 
London Heathrow; restore the route between Shannon and Heathrow, which was dropped by Aer Lingus last year, 
triggering a political outcry in western Ireland; and would guarantee trade union recognition at Aer Lingus.
One of the key tenets of Irish aviation policy has been the safeguarding of Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots. Dublin has 
been concerned that Ryanair would seek to sell the lucrative slots, eliminating routes to Ireland's closest global hub.
In response Ryanair said it would change Aer Lingus's articles of association to give a legally binding guarantee 
that the slots could not be sold, transferred, leased or switched to any other airline or to any other route without 
prior written government approval. This would guarantee routes to Heathrow from Dublin, Cork and Shannon.
Ryanair also sought to allay union fears last night by offering to "commit and guarantee" Aer Lingus's "long-standing 
policy of trade union recognition". An employee share ownership trust holds a 14 per cent stake in the airline.
Ryanair launched an all-cash offer on Monday of EUR1.40 a share, valuing Aer Lingus's equity at EUR748m 
(£649m). Aer Lingus shares closed 5 cents higher last night at EUR1.35.

The Irish government on Wednesday signalled it might be ready to dispose of its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus 
under the terms of a takeover bid tabled by Ryanair earlier this week.
Brian Lenihan, finance minister, told Irish radio that Ryanair "has made an offer which we will have to carefully 
consider".
But he added "the government will have to be very, very careful how they dispose of this very valuable national 
asset".
Ministers are worried about any change in ownership of Aer Lingus' landing slots at Heathrow, which are seen as 
vital for the Irish economy. They are also concerned about job losses.
But Mr Lenihan is facing severe budget constraints, and his remarks suggest the government has not ruled out 
selling its stake, contrary to its reaction to Ryanair's more generous earlier takeover bid in late 2006.
This potentially puts it on a collision course with Aer Lingus' board, which has already rejected the EUR1.40-a- 
share offer, which values the former state-owned carrier at EUR750m ($948m).
One of the new elements of the Ryanair offer is an undertaking to create 1,000 new jobs over a five-year period by 
increasing the Aer Lingus fleet.
Analysts say Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, has been careful to meet trade union and government 
concerns about job losses, recognising that the government together with an employee trust owning 14.4 per cent 
have, in effect, a blocking stake.
Dublin hint at selling Aer Lingus 25% stake
But Mr O'Leary also warned that even if Aer Lingus achieved the EUR50m of cost savings currently targeted, its 
cost per passenger would still be more than twice that of Ryanair.
Aer Lingus employees were Wednesday night set to respond to a novel cost-cutting programme under which 
workers were invited to leave the company and rejoin on less generous terms and conditions.
Company and trade unions brokered the compromise deal at the Labour Relations Commission, the main dispute 
arbitration body, as an alternative to the company's original plan to outsource 1,300 ground staff jobs.
Under the agreement, staff can either accept voluntary redundancy, take the "leave and return", which would entitle 
them to a EUR30,000 minimum lump sum severance pay, or they can stay on under the same terms and 
conditions.
The company is aiming to make savings of EUR24m as part of the bid to return the airline to profitability.
However, the company says the success of the scheme will depend on how many staff take up the "leave-and-
return" offer.

A good deal has changed in the airline industry and world economy since Brussels took the rare step of blocking 
Ryanair's original takeover bid for Aer Lingus.
But will the changed circumstances be enough to persuade the European Commission to think differently this time?
The sticking points in June 2007 were 35 routes to and from Ireland - notably to Dublin airport - where the merger 
would have given the combined group a monopoly or a dominant position.
Ryanair offered to give up some airport slots but the Commission decided this was "unlikely to stimulate market 
entry of a size necessary to replace the competitive pressure exercised by Aer Lingus".
Ryanair's argument this time is that without its bid, Aer Lingus will remain isolated and lossmaking.
But public interest considerations are not a part of European Union merger rules and lawyers suspect that 
competition officials will need a lot of persuading before they relax their approach just because of current 
conditions.
There was no sign of a looser interpretation in the Commission's recent examination of the now abandoned 
BHP/Rio take-over bid.
Frank Fine, a competition lawyer in Brussels, says: "Everyone was looking at BHP/Rio. The Commission could 
have lightened the required divestitures, for example . . . but they didn't make things easier."
Simon Barnes of Lovells, the law firm, says: "The fact that economic times are tough doesn't mean you can do 
anticompetitive mergers."
Sudden shift in competition headwinds is unlikely
European law allows for a "failing firm" argument but the bar is high.
The company in question must be close to collapse with no rival alternative bid that would be less anticompetitive 
available.
Jonathan Gowdy of Morrison & Foerster, the law firm, says: "It's a very difficult proposition to satisfy."

Innovation is a word like democracy. Everyone is in favour of it, but different people attach different meanings to it. 
Sometimes the term is used to describe anything that differentiates one product or process from another. At other 
times, innovation is the product of men in white coats who conduct rarefied experiments in biotechnology or 
electronics.
Is Easyjet an innovative company? Along with Ryanair, the company transformed the European aviation market. 
But everything the company did was already done by someone else, and the entire product and process were close 
to those South West Airlines had pioneered in the US.
There is no purpose in arguing about what is the correct definition of innovation. What matters is that people 
understand what they are saying when they talk to each other. The frequent, often unnoticed, shift between wide 
and narrow definitions of innovation may be seriously misleading. Generalities about the importance of innovation in 
creating competitive advantage in business are translated into specific policies to subsidise research and 
development and the promotion of particular kinds of scientific education.
Such policies are described as "techno nationalism" in an important recent book called The Venturesome Economy 
by Amar Bhidé. Techno nationalism is derived from the belief that economic growth depends on high technology 
and that we will benefit fully from it only if it is our own high technology. Techno nationalism is as common in 
Europe, which believes it is falling behind, as in America, which fears it may be overtaken. But the fear that western 
economic prosperity is endangered by China's flood of engineering graduates is not only exaggerated: it may be the 
reverse of the truth.
The central fallacy of the New Economy bubble was that most of the benefits of new technologies would go to 
pioneering companies. But the repeated experience of economic history is that competition ensures that the larger 
The east's innovators are no threat to the west
part of the benefits of these technologies accrue to users. In an admittedly speculative calculation, the American 
economist Bill Nordhaus has suggested that consumers get more than 97 per cent of the value of innovations.
What is true of companies is also true of states. The US has a world leading position in information technology but 
the products of that technology are available everywhere with minimal delay. And cheaply: the profits of Microsoft, 
though large in absolute terms, are less than 0.1 per cent of the national income of the US and Europe.
That is why economist Paul Romer can observe that: "In 1985, I paid $1,000 per million transistors for memory in 
my computer. In 2005 I paid less than $10 per million and yet I did nothing to deserve or help pay for the windfall." 
But Prof Bhidé is not so sure that Prof Romer did nothing to deserve it and nor am I.
What distinguishes the US is not just its innovative technologists, but its innovative manufacturers, retailers and 
consumers. Discoveries are made in an environment that is responsive to ideas, ready to embrace change and 
always willing to try out something new. People who are likely to invent things want to be part of a culture that is 
open to novelty, and cultures that are open to novelty are those that will reward innovators best. That is why there 
are so many entrepreneurs of Chinese and Indian origin in the US - and Britain - even as more and more mundane 
jobs are outsourced to China and India.
The pesky American students who are ready to challenge every assertion the instructor makes contrast with 
students from other cultures who believe their aim is to transcribe every authoritative statement that is delivered. 
These voluble business students are the bane of the MBA teacher's life. They are also the people who make 
American business great.
Commercial and economic success, even in technological industries, depends not on the quality of technology, but 
on the match between technology and the needs of its customers. That is why the growing technological 
capabilities of China and India create more commercial opportunities than threats for American and European 
businesses.

Aer Lingus is uniquely vulnerable to Ryanair's advances, according to Michael O'Leary, in spite of the rejection of 
his latest bid on Monday night.
The budget airline's aggressive chief executive certainly knows his Irish rival intimately. He knows where he would 
cut costs, where he would make money and where Aer Lingus loses it. And he knows how he would face down the 
notoriously truculent unions at the smaller airline, if they opposed a takeover.
"It is 100 yards away across the car park in Dublin," Mr O'Leary said yesterday. "We know it well. If we were to do 
SkyEurope [the struggling Bratislava-based low-cost airline] or some other carrier, we wouldn't know the business 
well."
With Aer Lingus he said, "We would take a short-haul high-cost carrier and make it a short-haul, much lower- cost 
carrier. And we would make money."
There is also the attraction of the strong Aer Lingus balance sheet, with EUR767m (£651m) of net cash at the end 
of September.
Buying the shares it does not already own would cost Ryanair just EUR520m - its bid values Aer Lingus' total equity 
at EUR748m. The enterprise value after operating leases is EUR281m, before unknown pension deficits.
Even the ever-confident Mr O'Leary accepted the odds of success were still carefully balanced, however. "We need 
both the government [the state owns 25 per cent] and the board. It is by no means certain, but there is a 50-50 
chance we get both."
Ryanair in fresh Aer Lingus assault
And in spite of Monday night's initial rejection the odds have moved in Ryanair's favour in the two years since it 
made its first abortive bid, which met solid resistance from the Irish government, trade unions and the workforce, as 
well as competition authorities in Brussels.
Since then, Mr O'Leary has kept Aer Lingus in his sights, never giving the merest hint of giving up his prey. He has 
steadily built Ryanair's Aer Lingus stake to 29.8 per cent, as the share price has languished.
He said: "The government finances are in a mess, it means deep and painful cuts in health and education. This 
[bid] offers the government EUR188m [for the remaining government stake]. This is a fantastic time to offer a way 
out. And we are offering growth and 1,000 new jobs rather than capacity cutbacks and job cuts."
Ryanair's original bid shocked the Irish government. It was launched only days after the previously state-owned 
Irish flag carrier had been successfully floated in Dublin and London in September 2006.
On Monday, Irish ministers reacted cautiously to the latest Ryanair salvo, though there was no outright rejection. 
Noel Dempsey, transport minister, said: "We'll wait until we get the full picture, and wait until the board has had a 
chance to look at it and at that stage we'll start a consideration."
Ryanair believes the government may well be more amenable to relinquishing its 25 per cent stake with the offer of 
cash on the table and having watched Aer Lingus struggle for two years.
Aer Lingus forecasts a loss for 2008 and 2009 and its costs are much higher than Ryanair and EasyJet.
Last month Aer Lingus said itself that the business had to change fundamentally, outlining a plan to save EUR74m 
a year.
Dermot Mannion, chief executive, said it cost Aer Lingus EUR80 to produce a short-haul seat compared to EUR60 
at EasyJet and EUR40 at Ryanair, with the biggest differences in labour and sales and distribution costs. Mr 
Mannion has already been forced by union pressure to dilute the cost cutting.
On Monday night, Aer Lingus said it remained "a strong business with significant cash reserves and a robust 
future", saying the bid significantly undervalues the company.
Ryanair, in turn, says it could use scale and low-cost expertise to transform the airline by forcing suppliers, airports 
and maintenance providers to adopt tougher and cheaper contracts.
It is offering Aer Lingus employees a chance to cash in shares at a 25 per cent premium, alongside the prospect of 
future growth with a doubling of the short-haul fleet and 1,000 new jobs. More ominously, it gives no guarantees to 
the existing 4,200 Aer Lingus workers.
The company believes it can also make headway in Brussels, as the competitive landscape has changed. The 
original Ryanair/Aer Lingus deal is the only airline takeover ever blocked by Europe's competition authorities.
Irish competition concerns have been jettisoned in sectors such as banking and Mr O'Leary is gambling that this 
time the Irish government will prefer the gains of consolidation to competition.

out. And we are offering growth and 1,000 new jobs rather than capacity cutbacks and job cuts."
Ryanair's original bid shocked the Irish government. It was launched only days after the previously state-owned 
Irish flag carrier had been successfully floated in Dublin and London in September 2006.
On Monday, Irish ministers reacted cautiously to the latest Ryanair salvo, though there was no outright rejection. 
Noel Dempsey, transport minister, said: "We'll wait until we get the full picture, and wait until the board has had a 
chance to look at it and at that stage we'll start a consideration."
Ryanair believes the government may well be more amenable to relinquishing its 25 per cent stake with the offer of 
cash on the table and having watched Aer Lingus struggle for two years.
Aer Lingus forecasts a loss for 2008 and 2009 and its costs are much higher than Ryanair and EasyJet.
Last month Aer Lingus said itself that the business had to change fundamentally, outlining a plan to save EUR74m 
a year.
Dermot Mannion, chief executive, said it cost Aer Lingus EUR80 to produce a short-haul seat compared to EUR60 
at EasyJet and EUR40 at Ryanair, with the biggest differences in labour and sales and distribution costs. Mr 
Mannion has already been forced by union pressure to dilute the cost cutting.
On Monday night, Aer Lingus said it remained "a strong business with significant cash reserves and a robust 
future", saying the bid significantly undervalues the company.
Ryanair, in turn, says it could use scale and low-cost expertise to transform the airline by forcing suppliers, airports 
and maintenance providers to adopt tougher and cheaper contracts.
It is offering Aer Lingus employees a chance to cash in shares at a 25 per cent premium, alongside the prospect of 
future growth with a doubling of the short-haul fleet and 1,000 new jobs. More ominously, it gives no guarantees to 
the existing 4,200 Aer Lingus workers.
The company believes it can also make headway in Brussels, as the competitive landscape has changed. The 
original Ryanair/Aer Lingus deal is the only airline takeover ever blocked by Europe's competition authorities.
Irish competition concerns have been jettisoned in sectors such as banking and Mr O'Leary is gambling that this 
time the Irish government will prefer the gains of consolidation to competition.

Ryanair renewed its hostile efforts to take over Aer Lingus by launching an all-cash offer on Monday valuing its 
smaller Irish rival at EUR748m.
Europe's biggest low cost carrier is offering EUR1.40 a share for Aer Lingus, exactly half the level it offered in 
October 2006, when it valued the company at EUR1.48bn. The offer represents a 25 per cent premium to last 
Friday's closing price of EUR1.12.
Ryanair's first bid, launched in October 2006, ran into opposition from the Irish government, which still holds a 25 
per cent stake, and from the workforce. An employee share ownership trust still holds 14 per cent.
The original takeover bid was eventually blocked in June last year by the European competition authorities on the 
grounds the merged airline would have an overwhelming dominance at Dublin airport and in the Irish market.
Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, said last year a combination of the two carriers would have led to 
a near-monopoly in the Irish market and would have harmed passengers. "Monopolies are bad for consumers 
because they reduce choice, lower quality and give rise to higher prices. Low cost carriers like Ryanair are no 
exception to this rule," she said last year.
Ryanair, which already holds a stake of 29.82 per cent which it bought at an average price of EUR2.50, is still 
awaiting the outcome of its appeal against the European Commission ruling.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said on Monday the group had decided to launch a new offer in the belief 
the competitive landscape had changed substantially with a wave of consolidation already under way in the 
European airline industry.
Ryanair launches fresh bid for Aer Lingus
The original Ryanair/Aer Lingus deal is the only airline takeover to have been blocked by the European competition 
authorities. A host of other transactions are going ahead including Lufthansa taking over Brussels Airlines and BMI 
British Midlland, and Alitalia merging with Air One in Italy. Lufthansa is also bidding for Austrian Airlines and British 
Airways is in talks on a merger with Spain's Iberia.
Mr O'Leary said he believed there was a also a good chance the Irish government would react more favourably to 
the new offer.
Since the original bid two years ago there has been a general election and a change of much of the government 
leadership, while the country's economy has plunged into recession placing heavy pressures on the state budget.
He claimed Aer Lingus's strategy for staying independent had failed in the last two years with the carrier falling into 
loss and going through a third round of restructuring and cost cutting.
Mr O'Leary said there was a "50/50 chance" the Irish government would change its mind.
"The government finances are in a mess, it means deep and painful cuts in health and education. This offers the 
government EUR188m. This is a fantastic time to offer the government a way out. And we are offering growth and 
1,000 new jobs rather than capacity cutbacks and job cuts."
Ryanair's original bid shocked the Irish government and was launched only days after the previously state-owned 
Irish flag carrier had been successfully floated in Dublin and London.
Noel Dempsey, Irish transport minister, said the government would "evaluate" the Ryanair offer "from the 
perspective of the government as a shareholder in Aer Lingus and having regard to Ireland's aviation policy."
The trade union SIPTU, which represents many of the Aer Lingus ground staff and some cabin crew, described the 
offer as "mischief making" by an airline intent on creating a monopoly.
In morning trading on Monday the Aer Lingus share price rose by 16 cents or 14 per cent to EUR1.28, while 
Ryanair fell by 6 cents or 2.2 per cent to EUR2.87.
Ryanair said it planned to merge the two carriers into "one strong Irish airline group under common ownership." The 
two airlines would operate as separate companies and Ryanair would maintain the Aer Lingus brand.
It was seeking early meetings wiith the Irish finance and transport ministers, with the Aer Lingus board and with the 
employee share ownership trust.
Ryanair said it was offering a commitment to double the Aer Lingus short-haul fleet from 33 to 66 aircraft during the 
next five years creating 1,000 new jobs.
It was aiming to establish one of the Europe's "big four airlines" alongside Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and British 
Airways. It would be "financially strong" and headquartered in Dublin.
It was committed to cutting Aer Lingus's short-haul fares by 5 per cent for the next three years and to removing fuel 
surcharges on its long-haul fares.
It also committed itself to maintaining Aer Lingus's take off and landing slots at London Heathrow for flights to 
Dublin and Cork, meeting a concern of the Irish government for maintaining the country's connections to a global 
network. It made no commitment to maintain Aer Lingus's flights between Belfast and Heathrow, however.
It highlighted the collapse in the Aer Lingus share price from more than EUR3 in December 2006 to less than EUR1 
earlier this month and the airline's forecast of operating losses in both 2008 and 2009.
It said Aer Lingus was an "isolated, uncompetitive loss-making EU flag carrier which had been by-passed by 
accelerating EU-wide airline consolidation."
Ryanair launches fresh bid for Aer Lingus
The offer would be financed from Ryanair cash reserves.
The group is being advised by Davy corporate finance and Morgan Stanley.
The combined group would handle around 68m passengers a year with a fleet of more than 200 aircraft, 850 routes 
and 33 bases across the European Union.

Banks are consolidating in the crisis. Airlines are too - Ryanair being the latest to try in its opportunistic pop at Aer 
Lingus. This is the second time the low cost carrier has had a go at the Irish carrier, only this offer, at EUR1.40 a 
share, is half what Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, offered two years ago.
The bid puts Aer Lingus in a bind. It is small. It is lossmaking. And, offering mostly short haul European flights that 
are being chomped away by low-cost carriers, stuck in a strategic corner. Combining with a large European airline - 
like British Airways or Lufthansa - might be an alternative. But they are busy with mergers of their own.
Last time, Ryanair's bid failed following hefty opposition from Dublin and Aer Lingus staff. Eventually the European 
Union blocked the deal on competition grounds. This offer has a better chance. The financial crisis is throwing up 
combinations, such as Lloyds TSB/Halifax Bank of Scotland, that wouldn't have passed muster six months ago. The 
Irish government has changed and, with a 25 per cent stake, is hungry for cash. So too, presumably, are Aer 
Lingus' employee and pension funds, which own around 20 per cent and have seen the value of their holdings 
collapse. Ryanair, meanwhile, already owns almost 30 per cent. Although it has set 90 per cent shareholder 
acceptance as a condition of its bid, that rule can be waived, like last time.
O'Leary envisages creating an Irish champion, operated under two separate brands, with some long haul flights. 
Yet Ryanair could achieve that by itself. So why bother? The answer is price. Buying the shares it doesn't already 
own would cost Ryanair a mere EUR520m. Better still, given Aer Lingus' EUR800m of net cash, the deal would 
fund itself. Aer Lingus needs to revamp those old defence documents and seek a higher price.

A good deal has changed in the airline industry and the world economy since Brussels blocked Ryanair's bid for Aer 
Lingus. But will the changed circumstances be enough to persuade the European Commission to think differently 
this time?
The sticking points in June 2007 were 35 routes to and from Ireland - notably to Dublin airport - where the merger 
would have given the combined group a monopoly or a dominant position.
Ryanair offered to give up some airport slots but the Commission decided this was "unlikely to stimulate market 
entry of a size necessary to replace the competitive pressure exercised by Aer Lingus".
Ryanair's argument this time is that without its bid, Aer Lingus will remain isolated and lossmaking.
But public interest considerations are not a part of European Union merger rules and lawyers suspect that 
competition officials will need a lot of persuading before they relax their approach just because of current 
conditions.
There was no sign of a looser interpretation in the Commission's recent examination of the now abandoned 
BHP/Rio takeover bid.
Frank Fine, a competition lawyer in Brussels, says: "Everyone was looking at BHP/Rio. The Commission could 
have lightened the required divestitures, for example . . . but they didn't make things easier."
Simon Barnes of Lovells, the law firm, says: "The fact that economic times are tough doesn't mean you can do 
anticompetitive mergers."
Sudden shift in competition headwinds unlikely
European law allows for a "failing firm" argument but the bar is high. The company in question must be close to 
collapse with no rival alternative bid that would be less anticompetitive available.
Jonathan Gowdy of Covington & Burling, the law firm, says: "It's a very difficult proposition to satisfy."

Anyone wondering how consumers behave in a recession need simply trawl the tabloids for inspiration. According 
to The Sun, sales of aphrodisiacs are up and so are sales of maternity dresses: not everything turns down in tough 
times, it seems. Elle Macpherson's underwear is said to be doing well; so too is the budget store Poundland. Some 
stories seem contradictory: one newspaper claims that Ryanair is set to make a profit, while another reports that 
weekend breaks to European cities are no longer in demand. Other stories are frankly bizarre: the crunch is alleged 
to have given a fillip to sales of cake, wooden "gravestones", West End musicals and tickets to see the film Mamma 
Mia!
The quality press has not resisted the temptation to join in the guessing game: The Economist imagined the return 
of the nutritious fish snoek, while this paper found evidence that physiotherapists were in demand to perk up 
stressed City workers.
All this speculation is an engaging diversion, but tells us little. Even the more solid reports are often based on 
anecdotes; many are simply spin or wishful thinking. I've heard a food retailer muse that Fairtrade-branded goods 
are recession-proof, because once people have seen the light about the importance of fair trade, they never turn 
back. A travel industry expert told me that the worse things get, the more people feel in need of a holiday. Perhaps 
he is right. I wouldn't bet on it.
I doubt that these early reports will tell us much about what will happen in the trough of this recession. One of the 
reasons people curtail their spending is because they lose their jobs. But unemployment is not yet especially high: it 
was higher in late 2006 than in September this year. There is plenty of scope for things to worsen on that score.
Economic theory tells us that consumers should cut back their spending if they believe that their earning power will 
fall for an extended period of time, but if they believe the hard times are temporary - say, a short period out of work - 
What will we buy to help us through hard times?
they should "smooth" by borrowing in hard times and paying back when things pick up. Because of smoothing, 
consumption should not shrink as much as the economy does. That sounds reassuring, but Ray Barrell of the 
National Institute of Economic and Social Research has two pieces of bad news.
The first is that this is the wrong sort of recession: because it was precipitated by a banking crisis, consumption may 
well fall much more dramatically. That's plausible. Consumers who want to smooth consumption can't borrow to do 
so. This is what happened during the 14 banking crises in various high-income countries that Barrell and his 
colleagues have studied.
The second piece of bad news relates to the first. Because consumers were already borrowing heavily in the good 
times, both credit constraints and a long overdue realism are likely to bite all the more deeply. That, too, is a 
tendency Barrell finds in the data.
Of course, as the sellers of herbal Viagra are said to be discovering, when consumer spending falls, some products 
do well and others do very badly. Nervous retailers looking for clues might wish to pick up research from the 1990s

AirAsia X chases long-haul dream

The aviation landscape is littered with the jetsam of failed attempts to launch low-fare, long-haul scheduled air 
services, but the industry's track record has not deterred AirAsia X from entering the fray.
Ventures such as Freddie Laker's Skytrain in the 1970s and the US carrier Peoplexpress in the 1980s to the recent 
start-ups Oasis Hong Kong and Zoom Airlines, have all collapsed.
Low fare is easy. It is low cost that is the problem, coupled with the enormous pressure that can be exerted on start-
up airlines by the incumbent full service network carriers.
Traditionally, long-haul scheduled airlines make all their profits from the front of the aircraft, from their premium 
business class passengers, whose inflated fares subsidise very low prices at the back of the plane in the economy 
cabin.
Without the business cabins, low-cost rivals have found it hard to make money.
The failure rate does not stop aviation pioneers from dreaming, however. The promise of a low cost, long-haul 
service exercises a powerful attraction on the imaginations of some of the most successful practitioners of the well-
proven short-haul low cost business model.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ireland's Ryanair, the market leader in Europe, said recently he had a business 
plan in the drawer ready to go, but he believed it could only be put into operation if he was able to buy a fleet of 
wide-body jets at rock bottom prices.
The recession may be playing into his hands, as the market for new aircraft softens.
AirAsia X chases long-haul dream
The business would operate direct, point-to-point services and would not engage in connecting flights through the 
Ryanair European bases in order to avoid the complexity and costs of the existing network carriers, which feed 
traffic across their main hubs.
While Mr O'Leary looks west from Europe he has been beaten to the punch in Asia by one of his most successful 
imitators, Tony Fernandes, the founder of AirAsia, which began regional short-haul services from Kuala Lumpur in 
2001 and has already grown to a fleet of 87 single aisle jets. Beyond Malaysia it also has affiliate airlines in 
Indonesia and Thailand.
His original dream was low cost, long-haul, however, and a year ago he began to put it into operation with the 
launch of flights by ­AirAsia X.
He also offers premium seats at the front of the cabin, but he insists he is sticking zealously to the bible of low cost 
operation. There is no interlining of traffic with all the complexity of passenger and baggage transfers at a hub 
airport. If passengers connect they do it themselves, book two separate flights and collect and check in baggage 
themselves.
There are no free lounges. Food and drink are bought on board, and above all he is aiming to "sweat the assets" in 
unprecedented fashion, by attempting to get 18-and-a-half hours daily utilisation out of his aircraft. The aircraft 
makers say even the most ambitious long-haul airlines have only achieved up to 17 hours hitherto and the norm 
would be more like 15 hours.
Mr Fernandes claims the model is already proving itself in Asia on flights of 7-8 hours. The next challenge is to 
bring it to Europe. The London/Kuala Lumpur service is being launched initially with five flights a week with one 
aircraft leased from Air Canada, but it is expected to become a daily service when a second aircraft is procured next 
year.
Mr Fernandes said the eventual vision was to seek to operate a virtual shuttle between Stansted and Kuala Lumpur 
with as many as five flights a day drawing feeder traffic from elsewhere in Europe and Asia.

Sir Stelios spells out fears for EasyJet

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder and largest shareholder in EasyJet, dug in his heels on Sunday in his public 
disagreement with the rest of the airline's board over its growth strategy in the midst of the deepening recession.
In an interview with the Financial Times, he said he was engaging with other shareholders and with financial 
analysts to explain his concern that the group was not sufficiently focused on conserving cash and on limiting its big 
capital expenditure commitments. The group's leading institutional investors include Standard Life, Wellington, 
Fidelity and Schroders.
"The real issue is the Airbus contract," he said, under which EasyJet is committed to taking delivery of 109 new 
A320 family short-haul jets during the next four years with a total value of $5.1bn at list prices before heavy 
discounts.
"I am keen to focus the debate on how much they cost, and how they are to be paid for, rather than on passenger 
numbers," he said.
Sir Stelios, who founded EasyJet in 1995, has been a pioneer, alongside Ireland's Ryanair, of the low-cost business 
model in Europe. It has been built on capturing large chunks of market share from established carriers as well as on 
stimulating growth by offering much lower fares and by having a lower cost base than other airlines.
The rapidly expanding low-cost carriers have been given a valuation premium as growth stocks, but Sir Stelios said 
he believed this era was over. "At the heart the question is are we a growth company or a mature company. I think 
it [EasyJet] is a mature company."
Sir Stelios spells out fears for EasyJet
EasyJet management, backed by the rest of the board, said last week it was taking a cautious approach, but Sir 
Stelios, a non-executive director, told investors he believed that the group's approach was "based on optimistic 
assumptions about future revenues".
EasyJet's shares are down 5 per cent since the row emerged a week ago.
On Sunday, Sir Stelios expressed the concern that low-cost airlines were not recession-proof like low-cost food 
stores such as Wal-Mart, Aldi or Lidl.
He feared the customers would not be there to fill all the "aluminium tubes" on order from Airbus. "Anyone just 
unemployed must still go to Aldi to buy the cheapest food to survive," he said, "but he does not need to go for a 
stag party to Prague with his mates."

Controversial Alitalia deal gets government greenlight

Italy's centre-right government is set to approve the controversial sale of lossmaking Alitalia to a group of Italian 
investors in spite of complaints by rival airlines of illegal state aid and accusations that its assets have been 
undervalued.
Augusto Fantozzi, the administrator overseeing the flag carrier's bankruptcy, said he had received the green light 
from a government committee that had determined that the offer from Compagnia Aerea Italiana (Cai) was in line 
with market prices. Formal government approval is expected shortly.
Cai, headed by Roberto Colaninno and numbering 16 Italian businesses, says its offer is worth about EUR1bn 
($1.26bn), made up of about EUR275m in cash and the balance in taking on part of Alitalia's debt. Only EUR100m 
is to be paid up front.
Cai is acquiring Alitalia's prime assets, including 80 aircraft, the brand, its slots and traffic rights. Several thousand 
jobs will be cut. The new Alitalia will be merged with its smaller rival, Air One, giving the new airline a near 
monopoly on some routes.
Opposition politicians accuse Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, of setting up a sweetheart deal for the Italian 
consortium, which is in advanced negotiations to sell a 20 per cent stake to Air France-KLM immediately and a 
controlling stake in the longer term. Mr Berlusconi, campaigning for election last April, promised to block a takeover 
by Air France-KLM and to keep the airline in Italian hands.
The Italian media has noted that Banca Leonardo, adviser to the government on valuing the airline, has two 
members of Cai on its board, and that Antonio Tajani, European Commissioner for Transport who approved the 
conditions of the sale, is from Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.
Controversial Alitalia deal gets government greenlight
The government owns 49.9 per cent of Alitalia. Rival airlines intend to challenge what they call illegal Italian state 
aid in the courts. Ryanair has condemned the EC decision as a "farce" and a "blatantly corrupt" decision.
"Fantozzi is giving a Christmas present to Cai," commented Gianni Rossi, chief executive of Meridiana, Italy's third-
largest airline.
He told the Financial Times that Meridiana had made an offer to Mr Fantozzi for aircraft and slots at Milan's Linate 
airport, but that he got no reply.
Slots - allocations of landing and take-off times - are a legal and financial grey zone. Airlines do not own slots 
outright, but in practice they carry a market value. BMI British Midland, being bought by Lufthansa, had valued its 
slots at £770m ($1,160m).
Cai said it put a zero value on Alitalia's slots. Mr Rossi said he estimated the value of Alitalia's slots at EUR400m. A 
study by the non-profit Bruno Leoni Institute estimated EUR550m to EUR900m.
Last December Alitalia sold three pairs of slots at Heathrow, Europe's most congested airport, for EUR92m. It has 
10 more pairs.

EasyJet higher despite boardroom battles

EasyJet was one of the best performing FTSE 350 stocks yesterday in spite of its boardroom fight while Ryanair, its 
low-cost rival, fell in a weak overall market.
The strategies of the two low-cost carriers for dealing with the deepening recession are diverging sharply.
The Irish airline continues to add capacity with the aim of gaining market share, while the EasyJet board is at odds 
over how cautious it should be and whether it should halt expansion.
Shares in EasyJet rose 10½p to 276½p, making it the eighth-strongest performer, while Ryanair fell 5 cents to 
EUR2.80.
Some analysts warned of the risks posed by the attempt by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, EasyJet founder and a non-
executive director, to increase his influence by appointing two of his own nominees to the board, and warned of the 
impact the fight could have on the valuation of the group.
Sir Stelios is seeking to persuade the EasyJet board to adopt an ultra-cautious approach.
Andrew Fitchie, aviation analyst at Collins Stewart, said EasyJet was viewed as a growth stock. "Any change in 
strategy would markedly impact value," he said.
"We have long argued that low-cost carriers' profits are boosted by growth; cheap aircraft, maintenance holidays 
and the benefit of increasing scale all depress unit costs. Ex-growth, we would expect these trends to unwind."
EasyJet higher despite boardroom battles
By contrast Ryanair was showing no signs of scaling down. "It has decided to adopt the high-risk strategy of 
continued expansion, attempting to leverage off its lower cost base and to take share from weaker competitors. 
EasyJet is strategically boxed into a corner," Mr Fitchie said.
EasyJet is due to report its full-year results today with an expected fall in underlying profits from £191m to about 
£120m.
The dispute between Sir Stelios and the rest of the board could take some time to resolve, as the two sides take 
legal advice over the interpretation of the EasyJet articles of association.
Sir Stelios said at the weekend: "The articles are clear that I can be chairman and I can appoint an additional two 
non-executive directors ...But what complicates matters is that I do not want to be chairman.
"What's not that clear . . . I have to admit, is if I can be a non-executive director but not chairman - but of course a 
chairman is de facto also a director - and still appoint two additional non-executive directors."
Lawyers on both sides were trying to clarify the issue.
Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at RBS, said: "It is clearly suboptimal that management is distracted at this 
challenging time in the market, a time also during which opportunities may arise as other airlines fail, which will call 
for prompt and bold decision-making."

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, one of the most flamboyant European entrepreneurs of the past decade, is seeking to 
wrest back influence over EasyJet amid a growing boardroom dispute at the low-cost airline.
Sir Stelios has fallen out with the EasyJet board over the airline's strategic direction and is pushing the company, 
his most successful creation, to be much more cautious in the face of the growing crisis in the global airline 
industry.
He is challenging the airline's strategy of ambitious growth supported by the acquisition of hundreds of cheap 
Airbus aircraft.
The company's shares fell by almost 5 per cent as investors worried about divisions at the top of the company. To 
push his case, Sir Stelios has increased his stake in the airline in order to appoint two more directors to the board.
He has raised his holding from 15.6 to 26.9 per cent via the transfer of the legal interest in his sister's 11.3 per cent 
stake to EasyGroup Holdings, his Cayman Islands-registered company.
With more than 25 per cent, Sir Stelios has the right under EasyJet's articles of association to appoint the new 
directors,giving him control of a quarter of the board.
He has also reminded EasyJet directors of his right to appoint himself chairman should they seek to block the 
move.
Stelios battles to steer EasyJet from ambitious strategy
In a statement, EasyJet said that the board had already sought to adopt a "more cautious approach to fleet growth" 
given the downturn in the market and had taken steps to conserve cash, reduce growth plans and dispose of 
surplus aircraft.
It said Sir Stelios had indicated, however, that he wished the company "further to restrict future aircraft orders and 
to make future dividend payments "in conjunction with a cessation or slowing of growth".
EasyJet, in common with Ryanair, its fast-growing Irish rival, has never paid dividends in the belief that the group 
was a growth stock that rewarded investors through capital appreciation from a rising share price.
Sir Stelios's surprise intervention indicates he might believe the era of such growth is over.
In an e-mailed statement, he said: "I am merely applying my rights under the articles of association of the company 
to protect my investment in EasyJet.
"I did not request a dividend now. I think the company should plan to pay one in 2011 if the markets allow."
Sir Stelios's 15.6 per cent stake is valued at £175m (EUR204m).

Aer Lingus and trade unions representing its 4,300 staff have been invited to talks on Wednesday by the Irish 
government as fears escalate of possible strikes at the former state-owned airline.
The intervention on Tuesday by the National Implementation Body, the arbitration agency chaired by the 
taoiseach's (prime minister's) senior civil servant, came as Irish travel agents warned holidaymakers not to use Aer 
Lingus over the Christmas period because of strike fears.
The warnings follow the decision on Monday by the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, the 
main trade union at the airline, to give the company two weeks' notice of possible strike action over plans to 
outsource 1,300 jobs among ground staff at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.
In a statement accompanying third quarter results, the company forecast operating losses this year of EUR20m 
(£16m) and losses in 2009.
"Operating at a financial loss is not sustainable. Aer Lingus must now deliver the required level of cost-saving 
measures to ensure the group is well-positioned to grow revenue and profitability into the future," it said.
The company is looking for savings of EUR50m by outsourcing jobs such as catering and baggage handling to 
third-party suppliers. It has written to every employee setting out the terms for voluntary redundancy or early 
retirement. The company said staff could transfer to the new suppliers on the same terms and conditions they 
enjoyed at Aer Lingus. It wants staff to respond to the plan by December 15.
Aer Lingus and unions invited to talks
In talks with unions, it said it would consider alternative proposals that would achieve the same savings. However, it 
warned on Tuesday that, if the trade unions do not come back with alternatives by December 1, it will proceed with 
its plans.
Meanwhile, Ryanair, which owns just below 30 per cent of the company and had a EUR2.70 a share takeover bid 
rebuffed in December 2006, declined to comment.
The Irish government, which retains a 25 per cent share of Aer Lingus, opposed Ryanair's bid. However, some 
brokers believe that, with government deficits mounting, Ryanair might decide it is opportune to bid again for the 
company.

Competition watchdog raps BAA over Stansted

BAA, the UK airports group, acted against the public interest in failing to consult adequately with airlines about its 
plans to build a second runway and terminal at Stansted airport according to a report published by the Competition 
Commission on Tuesday.
The Commission is separately investigating the structure of BAA and has already provisionally recommended the 
break-up of the group's airport monopolies in London and Scotland.
In a report on Tuesday on future price controls for Stansted, the third largest airport in the UK, the Commission was 
highly critical of the consultation process conducted by BAA and the information provided to airlines over the 
strategic development of the airport and its capital expenditure proposals.
It also found that BAA had acted against the public interest in the quality of service provided at Stansted in 
particular in the processing of passengers through security.
It recommended a service quality rebate scheme should be introduced similar to the scheme in operation at 
Gatwick airport.
BAA has been involved for years in an acrimonious dispute with its main airline customers at Stansted led by 
Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading European low cost carriers, over the scale of its planned capital investment at the 
airport.
A planning inquiry is due to start next spring into BAA's application to build a second runway at Stansted, which is 
facing fierce opposition from local authorities, residents and environmental campaigners.
Competition watchdog raps BAA over Stansted
Under the proposed timetable the first phase of the £2.5bn project could open in 2015. BAA is proposing to create a 
capacity to handle 68m passengers a year, the size of the current Heathrow airport, by around 2030 in a scheme 
supported by the 2003 white paper on air transport.
The size of the proposed investment has been criticised by the airline users of the airport.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, attacked again on Monday BAA's plan for "a gold-plated Taj Mahal" at 
Stansted and called both for the sale of the airport and for the dismissal of Harry Bush, the economic regulator for 
the airports at the Civil Aviation Authority.
The Competition Commission report rejected, however, Ryanair's claim of excessive pricing at Stansted and 
concluded that BAA's conduct with regard to airport charges in 2008/09 had not operated against the public 
interest.
It recommended that the cap on maximum charges at the airport should be raised to £6.56 per passenger in 
2009/10 from a projected charge of £6.34 in 2008/09. Charges should subsequently be allowed to increase by no 
more than retail price index (RPI) inflation plus 1.75 per cent each year, reaching a maximum of £7.05 per 
passenger in 2013/14.
Ryanair has been waging a campaign against what it regards as a doubling of charges in the last couple of years, 
as its previous discount deals have expired.
It is grounding 15 aircraft at Stansted this winter equivalent to 14 per cent of its capacity at the airport, its most 
important base, in order to cut losses on unprofitable routes and has blamed in part the big rise in charges.
Traffic volumes are falling at Stansted after several years of very strong growth in which the airport has become the 
most important airport in Europe for low cost air travel.
The Commission findings have been passed to the CAA, which must make the final decisions on the next five-year 
price cap regime for Stansted for the period starting in April next year. It must also impose remedies for areas, 
where BAA has acted against the public interest.
Its price cap proposals are due to be published on December 9 with the final decision due in March.
The Commission's recommendation to continue with a traditional price control regime at Stansted is a blow to the 
CAA's previous ambitions to end price controls for the airport.
The CAA called last year for price controls at Stansted to be removed altogether on the grounds that the airport was 
not a monopoly business, but it was rebuffed by Ruth Kelly, the then transport secretary.
The CAA has said Stansted did not have and was not likely to acquire "substantial market power." It recommended 
to the government that price controls should be removed and that price setting should be left to commercial 
negotiations between the airport and the airlines led by Ryanair and EasyJet.
Ms Kelly said earlier this year, however, that the CAA should continue to set the maximum level of charges at 
Stansted as the "best way of protecting passengers who use the airport."

Ryanair forecast it would be in loss during the second half of the year after first-half profits fell 77 per cent under 
pressure from the doubling of its fuel costs.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the recession would continue to drive down oil prices and fares this winter 
and said the group would "continue to respond with lower fares and aggressive price promotions" in order to fill 
seats in its expanding fleet.
He forecast average fares in the second half from October to March would fall by between 15 and 20 per cent, 
leading to losses in the third and fourth quarters.
The Irish carrier left its previous profit guidance unchanged and Mr O'Leary said he was confident Ryanair would 
break even in the full year to the end of March, a steep fall from record profits a year ago.
The group is discounting fares to fill its rising capacity in a weakening market, as it seeks to gain market share. Mr 
O'Leary forecast average fares in the full year could fall by 12 per cent.
Ryanair had been hit in the first half by its failure to hedge its fuel requirements, but expects to benefit next year 
thanks to the decline in the crude oil price from the peak of $147 a barrel in July.
Mr O'Leary said if oil prices remained about $80 a barrel the group's earnings would "rebound strongly".
Ryanair said it had taken advantage of the recent falls in the oil price to hedge 25 per cent of its fuel needs for the 
six months from April to September next year at an average of $77 a barrel, which would "lock in a substantial 
saving" over the $125 a barrel paid in the same period this year.
Ryanair expects second-half fall into red
Ryanair said hedging markets had become illiquid as a result of the crisis in financial markets, however, and it had 
become difficult to find counterparties for its hedging contracts.
In the first half of this year Ryanair said pre-tax profits fell 77 per cent from EUR459.5m to EUR105.2m (£84m) 
including exceptional costs of accelerated depreciation of EUR25.7m on 15 aircraft to be disposed of in 2008-09 
and 2009-10, and a EUR93.6m writedown on the group's 29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, the smaller rival Irish 
carrier.
Excluding exceptional items, profits fell 51 per cent to EUR224.5m. Turnover rose 16.5 per cent to EUR1.81bn, 
while passenger numbers improved 19 per cent to 31.6m. Earnings per share fell from 26.61 cents to 6.42 cents.
Ryanair shares closed up 14 cents in Dublin at EUR2.83.

Ryanair profits fell heavily in its first six months under pressure from the doubling of fuel costs, and the group 
forecast that it would be in loss during the second half of the year.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the recession would continue to drive down oil prices and fares this winter.
Ryanair would "continue to respond with lower fares and aggressive price promotions," he said, in order to fill seats 
in its growing fleet.
The group, Europe's largest low cost carrier, had only "limited visibility" of forward bookings, but Mr O'Leary 
forecast average fares in the second half from October to March would fall by between 15 and 20 per cent leading 
to losses in the third and fourth quarters.
The Irish carrier left its previous guidance unchanged, and Mr O'Leary said he was confident Ryanair would break 
even in the full year to the end of March.
The group has been implementing a long series of discounted sale promotions to fill its rising capacity in a 
weakening market, as it gains market share, and Mr O'Leary forecast average fares in the full year could fall by 
almost 12 per cent.
The further decline in fares would be largely offset, however, by lower fuel costs, which were currently forecast at 
$73 a barrel for the fourth quarter.
Shares in Ryanair climbed 16 cents or 5.9 per cent to EUR2.85 in afternoon Dublin trading.
Ryanair profits fall sharply
Ryanair was hit in the first half of its financial year by its failure to hedge its fuel requirements, but it expects to 
benefit from this policy next year thanks to the steep decline in the crude oil price from the peak of $147 a barrel 
reached last July.
Mr O'Leary said that if oil prices remained at approximately $80 a barrel the group's earnings would "rebound 
strongly" next year.
"We have a significant cost advantage over our competitors many of whom have hedged fuel next year at 
significantly higher levels than current market prices. This will force competitors to further increase air fares and 
widen the price gap between them and Ryanair's lowest fares," he said.
With one of the strongest balance sheets in the airline industry and the lowest cost base, Ryanair was "strongly 
positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that will inevitably arise from the financial crisis and economic 
recession over the coming year," he said.
In the first half this year Ryanair said pre-tax profits had fallen by 77 per cent from EUR459.5m to EUR105.2m 
including exceptional costs of accelerated depreciation of EUR25.7m on 15 aircraft to be disposed in financial years 
2008/09 and 2009/10, and a EUR93.6m writedown on the group's 29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, the smaller rival 
Irish carrier.
Excluding exceptional items pre-tax profits fell by 51 per cent from EUR459.5m to EUR224.5m. Unit costs excluding 
fuel fell by 6 per cent in the half year but rose by 21 per cent including fuel.
Turnover rose by 16 per cent from EUR1.55bn to EUR1.81bn, while passenger numbers increased by 19 per cent 
from 26.6m to 31.6m. Basic earnings per share for the half year fell from 26.6 to 6.4 cents. The shares rose 
EUR0.18 or 6.7 per cent to EUR2.87 in morning trading in Dublin.
The recession had caused consumer confidence to collapse, but the outlook for the remainder of the financial year 
to the end of March depended on fares and the fuel price. The recession would continue to drive down both fares 
and the fuel price.
More than 30 airlines have collapsed around the world so far this year and Mr O'Leary forecast there would be 
more bankruptcies and consolidations in the industry.
After months betting the oil price would fall Ryanair finally decided in the summer, just as prices were peaking to 
hedge its fuel requirements for the third quarter with the result that it is 80 per cent hedged at $124 a barrel for the 
three months October to December. It is totally unhedged for the fourth quarter from January to March, however.
Mr O'Leary said in recent months a significant disconnect had emerged between spot and forward oil prices 
resulting in forward pricing at a premium of $17 a barrel over spot rates for the two quarters from April to September 
next year.
Hedging markets were illiquid, as a result of the crisis in financial markets, which partly explained the high 
premiums.
Ryanair had taken advantage of the recent falls in oil prices to hedge 25 per cent of its fuel needs for the six months 
from April to September next year, however, at an average of $77 a barrel.
Ryanair said it was grounding 15 aircraft at its main base at London Stansted and four at Dublin during the winter 
months to cut costs on loss-making routes, but overall capacity would continue to increase. It forecast an increase 
of 9 per cent in passenger numbers for the second half of the year and of 14 per cent for the full year to 58m.
The airline warned that the recent decision by the Irish government to introduce a EUR10 per passenger departure 
tax would hit its base at Shannon in western Ireland and the group warned it could cut flights and traffic there by up 
to 75 per cent from November next year.

Ryanair would "continue to respond with lower fares and aggressive price promotions," he said, in order to fill seats 
in its growing fleet.
The group, Europe's largest low cost carrier, had only "limited visibility" of forward bookings, but Mr O'Leary 
forecast average fares in the second half from October to March would fall by between 15 and 20 per cent leading 
to losses in the third and fourth quarters.
The Irish carrier left its previous guidance unchanged, and Mr O'Leary said he was confident Ryanair would break 
even in the full year to the end of March.
The group has been implementing a long series of discounted sale promotions to fill its rising capacity in a 
weakening market, as it gains market share, and Mr O'Leary forecast average fares in the full year could fall by 
almost 12 per cent.
The further decline in fares would be largely offset, however, by lower fuel costs, which were currently forecast at 
$73 a barrel for the fourth quarter.
Ryanair profits fall sharply
Ryanair was hit in the first half of its financial year by its failure to hedge its fuel requirements, but it expects to 
benefit from this policy next year thanks to the steep decline in the crude oil price from the peak of $147 a barrel 
reached last July.
Mr O'Leary said that if oil prices remained at approximately $80 a barrel the group's earnings would "rebound 
strongly" next year.
"We have a significant cost advantage over our competitors many of whom have hedged fuel next year at 
significantly higher levels than current market prices. This will force competitors to further increase air fares and 
widen the price gap between them and Ryanair's lowest fares," he said.
With one of the strongest balance sheets in the airline industry and the lowest cost base, Ryanair was "strongly 
positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that will inevitably arise from the financial crisis and economic 
recession over the coming year," he said.
In the first half this year Ryanair said pre-tax profits had fallen by 77 per cent from EUR459.5m to EUR105.2m 
including exceptional costs of accelerated depreciation of EUR25.7m on 15 aircraft to be disposed in financial years 
2008/09 and 2009/10, and a EUR93.6m writedown on the group's 29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, the smaller rival 
Irish carrier.
Excluding exceptional items pre-tax profits fell by 51 per cent from EUR459.5m to EUR224.5m. Unit costs excluding 
fuel fell by 6 per cent in the half year but rose by 21 per cent including fuel.
Turnover rose by 16 per cent from EUR1.55bn to EUR1.81bn, while passenger numbers increased by 19 per cent 
from 26.6m to 31.6m. Basic earnings per share for the half year fell from 26.6 to 6.4 cents. The shares rose 
EUR0.18 or 6.7 per cent to EUR2.87 in morning trading in Dublin.
The recession had caused consumer confidence to collapse, but the outlook for the remainder of the financial year 
to the end of March depended on fares and the fuel price. The recession would continue to drive down both fares 
and the fuel price.
More than 30 airlines have collapsed around the world so far this year and Mr O'Leary forecast there would be 
more bankruptcies and consolidations in the industry.
After months betting the oil price would fall Ryanair finally decided in the summer, just as prices were peaking to 
hedge its fuel requirements for the third quarter with the result that it is 80 per cent hedged at $124 a barrel for the 
three months October to December. It is totally unhedged for the fourth quarter from January to March, however.
Mr O'Leary said in recent months a significant disconnect had emerged between spot and forward oil prices 
resulting in forward pricing at a premium of $17 a barrel over spot rates for the two quarters from April to September 
next year.
Hedging markets were illiquid, as a result of the crisis in financial markets, which partly explained the high 
premiums.
Ryanair had taken advantage of the recent falls in oil prices to hedge 25 per cent of its fuel needs for the six months 
from April to September next year, however, at an average of $77 a barrel.
Ryanair said it was grounding 15 aircraft at its main base at London Stansted and four at Dublin during the winter 
months to cut costs on loss-making routes, but overall capacity would continue to increase. It forecast an increase 
of 9 per cent in passenger numbers for the second half of the year and of 14 per cent for the full year to 58m.
The airline warned that the recent decision by the Irish government to introduce a EUR10 per passenger departure 
tax would hit its base at Shannon in western Ireland and the group warned it could cut flights and traffic there by up 
to 75 per cent from November next year.

Michael O'Leary is in an ebullient mood. The Ryanair chief executive could hardly speak quickly enough on Monday 
in his eagerness to reel off all the airline collapses and takeover deals of recent months, as the wave of 
consolidation accelerates.
He believes opportunities are beckoning for Europe's largest low-cost carrier and he was revelling in the prospect of 
deepening recession.
During the last airline recession in the wake of the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, Ryanair made a 
grab for market share in Europe, driving down fares to push up passenger numbers. It is setting out to repeat the 
trick.
As others retrenched last time, Ryanair chose to grow more rapidly. It accepted a temporary blow to its profitability 
as it expanded the fleet and opened new routes and bases. Investors can expect more of the same this time.
In January 2002, as the lines of grounded jets parked in the US deserts stretched to the horizon, Ryanair placed an 
order for 100 Boeing 737-800 jets with options for another 50. It squeezed out of the US aircraft maker - at the time 
desperate for new orders - discounts that Mr O'Leary gleefully described as "rapacious".
The Irish carrier is not yet at the point where it is negotiating new orders with Boeing. The current delivery stream 
runs to 2012, by which time Mr O'Leary is confident the Irish carrier will have become the biggest short-haul carrier 
in Europe. At present it is still smaller - in terms of passenger numbers - in Europe than Air France-KLM and 
Lufthansa.
High ambitions to keep growing in downturn
But he made clear on Monday he may be back for more orders later, when the Boeing and Airbus backlogs have 
started to melt away, as the recession deepens. And he is hopeful that recession will bring down the prices of wide 
body, long-haul aircraft  so that he can launch his separate plan to start a company, unconnected to Ryanair, for a 
low-fare, long-haul airline operating across the North Atlantic.
Mr O'Leary feels the market and the recession are again working in his favour.
In the summer he was not looking nearly as confident. For many months he had chosen not to hedge Ryanair's fuel 
requirements in the belief that the surge in fuel prices was not sustainable. Without any hedges the airline was 
looking exposed, as the crude oil price peaked at $147 a barrel in July.
His nerve broke and he took out hedges for the current quarter from October to December for 80 per cent of the 
airline's requirements at $124 a barrel. But since then the oil price has tumbled. The O'Leary view has finally been 
vindicated. It was the timing that was a little out.
The result was clear on Monday. The group has taken all of the pain of the oil price rise in the current financial year 
to the end of March. Profits in the first half fell steeply as the fuel bill more than doubled to account for at least 50 
per cent of total operating expenses.
For the full year Mr O'Leary said he was confident the group would break even, a huge reverse from last year's 
record earnings, although Ryanair traditionally outperforms its most dire forecasts.
Now that the oil price has fallen, Ryanair feels it can benefit from a strong tail wind in the next financial year. It has 
already locked away 25 per cent of its fuel requirements for the first half at $77 a barrel compared with the $125 a 
barrel it paid in the same period this year.
Howard MiIlar, chief financial officer, said that if the oil price averages around $80 a barrel next year compared with 
an average of $110 this year, it will make savings of EUR420m (£336m).
How much of that shows up in the bottom line will depend on what happens to average fare levels. During the 
winter season, the group is intent on ploughing the savings on fuel into lower fares, which could fall by 15 to 20 per 
cent in the second half, said Mr O'Leary.
He said: "We expect continuing bankruptcies and consolidations to create even more opportunities for Ryanair to 
grow".
Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at RBS, said he had long-term doubts about the Ryanair model, from its 
dependence on local government financial support at many airports to its relations with staff and passengers.
The doubts were on hold in recession, however. As airlines went bankrupt, airports would be eager for Ryanair 
flights, pilots were in oversupply and passengers were trading down to the cheapest fares.
He said: "The maths says they will make a handsome profit next year, if the oil price stays around current levels 
and given their dollar hedging".

Norwegian to pick up where Sterling left off

Norwegian Air Shuttle is moving fast to fill the vacuum left by the collapse last week of Sterling Airlines, the 
Copenhagen-based, Iceland-owned low-cost carrier.
This week it will open a base in Copenhagen and is aiming to have eight to 10 jets operating out of the Danish 
capital by May, as it scrambles to find more aircraft for its fleet. Some of the parked Sterling jets are a priority initial 
acquisition target.
Largely unnoticed by many rivals, Norwegian has grown to become the fourth largest low-cost airline in Europe 
behind the big players Ryanair, EasyJet and Air Berlin. It will fly more than 9m passengers this year with a fleet of 
41 aircraft.
The group, which first listed in 2003, is seizing the opportunity offered by Sterling's bankruptcy to increase the pace 
of its own expansion despite the threat posed by the economic downturn.
Bjørn Kjos, chief executive of Norwegian, said "it is a huge opportunity".
He said that the group would replace Sterling as the main low-cost player in the Danish market.
Initially the airline would base two jets at Copenhagen from Thursday flying on six routes to Ålborg, Oslo, 
Stockholm, Alicante, Malaga and Nice.
It is planning to add further routes from Copenhagen to London, Amsterdam, Rome, Krakow, Prague, Barcelona 
and Pisa at the pace at which it could bring in more aircraft.
It is also starting new routes on Monday from Stockholm to some destinations previously served by Sterling.
Norwegian to pick up where Sterling left off
As weaker airlines retrench or collapse, "it's a good time to expand," Mr Kjos said. "The market (for aircraft) is much 
better than last year. . .There are a lot of different airlines that have gone bust. There are aircraft available now."
Norwegian is also posing an increasing competitive threat to SAS Scandinavian Airlines, the Nordic region's legacy 
network carrier, which is struggling.
"They have much higher costs than we have, about twice our level," said Mr Kjos.
The Oslo-based carrier made clear the scale of its future ambitions by placing an order in August last year with 
Boeing for 42 186-seat 737-800s for delivery between 2009 and 2014. The deal had a list price value before 
discounts of $3.1bn.
Deliveries do not start until next summer and the collapse of Sterling has left an urgent need for more capacity.
The group could close deals with lessors for more aircraft this week.
Norwegian got its finances in order just before the financial markets were hit by mayhem this autumn.
This summer it completed a NKr400m ($59.5m) rights issue to finance its deposit for its new fleet orders, and 
agreed a $160m debt deal with Natixis to fund the pre-delivery payments for the first 10 Boeing jets.

Sterling Airlines, the Danish low cost carrier, said on Wednesday it was filing for bankruptcy stranding thousands of 
passengers around Europe.
The airline, owned by Northern Travel Group, an Icelandic holding company controlled by Palmi Haraldsson, a 
leading Icelandic financier and entrepreneur, has been heavily loss-making for several years, but its final demise 
has been triggered by the financial problems of its Icelandic shareholder.
The company said on Wednesday it had failed in its "battle to keep the company alive" during the last few weeks, 
as its shareholder had become caught up in the collapse of the Icelandic economy and financial system.
Sterling said Mr Haraldsson's Northern Travel Group had provided DKr444.5m in further financial support between 
the end of July and the end of September in an attempt to fund another round of restructuring. The plan had been 
to continue the financial support into 2009.
"On September 29 the Icelandic financial environment started to collapse. Over a three to four weeks period, the 
whole financial system melted down, and that resulted in our shareholder being unable to continue his support to 
the company," said the airline.
Negotiations had been conducted with several potential investors, but it had been "impossible to make ends meet," 
and the airline had "no option but to file for bankruptcy."
Sterling, which carried around 4m passengers a year and has been been operating a fleet of 26 Boeing 737 short-
haul jets chiefly from its main Copenhagen base with a workforce of 1,100, ceased operations with immediate 
effect.
Sterling Airlines files for bankruptcy
It said customers, who had directly purchased their tickets on its website would not be refunded and neither would 
their return flights if they were currently travelling. They would have to book return flights with another airline.
Customers who had paid for a flight by credit card could be eligible for refunds from their bank or credit card 
company.
Sterling suffered a loss of more than DKr800m in 2005 after it was merged by its Icelandic shareholders with 
Maersk Air, another loss-making Danish carrier and the enlarged group has since failed to build a profitable 
operation despite several rounds of restructuring. It said it had again been hit by large losses in the first nine 
months this year.
Its demise will provide a welcome respite to SAS Scandinavian Airlines, the main legacy network carrier in northern 
Europe, which is also struggling to overcome losses and to cope with growing competition from low cost carriers 
including local rivals Sterling and Norwegian, and the pan-European operators Ryanair and EasyJet.
Sterling is the latest airline casualty of the deepening crisis in the global aviation sector, which has been hit hard 
this year first by the sharp rise in fuel costs and subsequently by the credit crunch and the downturn in demand for 
air travel.
Iata, the global air transport trade association, said last week that more than 30 airlines had already collapsed this 
year and another 20 were on its watch list for possible removal from the international airline billing system.
The UK charter carrier XL Airways collapsed in September stranding around 85,000 passengers, after its 
management shareholders lost financial support from their Icelandic backers after defaulting on loan payments. XL 
had previously been owned by Icelandic investors prior to a management buyout in 2006.
The airlines that have collapsed this year feature several start up operations of recent years including Eos Airlines, 
Silverjet and Maxjet, which were all-business class, long-haul carriers, Zoom Airlines, the Anglo-Canadian charter 
and scheduled operator, Oasis Hong Kong Airlines and Futura, a Spanish charter carrier.

After oil, falling traffic is the next crisis

In the airline world one crisis soon replaces another. The sharp decline in fuel prices is bringing some relief to the 
world's hard-pressed carriers, many of which were fighting for survival in the summer because of the record oil 
prices.
But the gains on the fuel front are being offset by falling traffic volumes, as recession looms in some of the biggest 
air travel markets.
The global aviation map is changing and consolidation accelerating as weaker airlines collapse. More than 30 have 
gone this year, says Iata, the airline industry trade association; 20 more are on the watchlist. Airlines managers are 
grounding aircraft to cut capacity.
Germany's Lufthansa, the main predator in Europe, on Wednesday announced its long-awaited takeover of BMI 
British Midland, only hours after Danish low cost carrier Sterling Airlines said it was filing for bankruptcy.
Financial turmoil and the job losses in the banking sector are taking their toll, especially on business travel, the key 
profit generator for many of the world's traditional network carriers. The credit squeeze is forcing up the price of 
financing new aircraft, where funds are still available. The strengthening of the dollar against the euro and the 
pound is eroding some of the gains from the falling dollar price of fuel, especially for European carriers.
Gerard Arpey, chairman and chief executive of American Airlines says while fuel prices have fallen from record 
levels a few months ago "the economic uncertainty, and what that might mean for travel demand, is a serious 
concern."
Fuel prices remain volatile, and he says it would be "short-sighted" to conclude fuel costs are no longer a challenge.
After oil, falling traffic is the next crisis
Some countries that were performing most strongly are leading the way down. Airline traffic in India fell 19 per cent 
in September. Air China reported September passenger traffic volumes down by 7.9 per cent.
Indian carriers, hurt by some of the world's highest jet fuel taxes, face such high losses that they are scrambling to 
consolidate after the wild years of expansion and have been forced to seek a deal with the government to delay 
paying overdue fuel bills. Rivals Jet Airways and Kingfisher have been forced into an alliance.
In Europe, even airlines with contrasting business models such as British Airways and Ryanair have, in a matter of 
months, gone from record profits to barely breaking even. Air France-KLM, the world's largest airline by revenues, 
and Lufthansa, the number two European player, are the latest to issue profit warnings.
The squeeze is forcing the pace of regional consolidation. Lufthansa is busiest with Brussels Airlines and BMI in the 
bag and stakes in Austrian Airlines, Alitalia and possibly SAS in its sights. BA is negotiating a merger with Spain's 
Iberia, although the plunge in the UK carrier's share price and worries about the size of its pension deficit could 
torpedo the deal. Air France-KLM is bidding against Lufthansa for a minority stake in a restructured Alitalia.
Consolidation is a particular feature in the US. Delta Air Lines says it is on track to complete its takeover of 
Northwest Airlines by the end of this year to create the biggest North American carrier.
US carriers have led the way in reducing capacity drastically for the coming winter. The cuts were forced originally 
by the surge in oil prices in the first half of the year; US carriers have on average the oldest fleets among airlines in 
the developed economies. The oil price has fallen from a July peak of $147 to about $60 a barrel but the capacity 
reductions remain timely given the falling demand for air travel.
As the crisis deepens, the lines of older aircraft parked in the US deserts are growing for the first time since 2005.
Since June, the world's airlines have announced, and begun to implement, a fleet reduction programme that 
already accounts for 1,083 aircraft, or 5 per cent of the global fleet, according to Ascend, the aviation consultancy.
About 75 per cent of fleet reductions are occurring in North America, where the airlines are cutting 10 per cent of 
their capacity, according to Eddy Pieniazek, Ascend director. Europe is cutting under 3 per cent of its capacity to 
date and Asia 2 per cent.
Ascend says there are no discernible cuts yet in the Middle East, which is still building its fleet and targeting 
capacity growth.
Airlines are inevitably uncertain as to the depth and the length of the coming recession. But Giovanni Bisignani, 
director general of Iata, says the sharp decline in passenger and cargo traffic in September is "alarming" and for the 
time being it is outpacing industry actions to cut capacity.
Aircraft values and lease rates are also falling, a sure sign of the mounting troubles. "We are only just beginning to 
see the impact of the economic slowdown and the financial crisis on aircraft values and lease rates," says Mr 
Pieniazek.
According to Ascend, lease rates for out of production narrow body jets have fallen by 20 per cent since the middle 
of the year, while rates for short-haul jets in production are down by 10 per cent. Overall aircraft values have fallen 
by 5 to 10 per cent.
Airbus and Boeing are preparing to step in as lenders of last resort to support selected sales during the coming 
year, as airlines find access difficult to some traditional sources of finance for buying new jets. Export credit 
agencies in the US and Europe are under pressure to fill more of the funding gap.
A leading European aviation banker says the number of institutions offering finance for new commercial jet 
deliveries has fallen by more than half to no more than 25.
After oil, falling traffic is the next crisis
Despite the rapid fall in fuel prices since July, Iata is maintaining its forecast for the global industry to fall to a net 
loss of $5.2bn this year. Mr Bisignani says the drop in the oil price is not enough to offset the impact of the drop in 
demand. "At this rate, losses may be even deeper than our forecast $5.2bn for this year."
In the six years to 2006, the global airline industry suffered net losses of $42bn and only returned to a $5.6bn profit 
in 2007.
According to Mr Bisignani "the industry crisis is deepening along with the crisis in the global economy."
More than 30 airlines have collapsed and been removed from the industry's international payment settlement 
system this year and a further 20 are on the watchlist for suspension.
Paddy Power, the leading Irish bookmaker, made tens of thousands of euros during September offering odds on 
the next airline to go bust. It took heavy bets on XL Airways, the UK charter carrier, which came in from a 10-1 
outsider to a 4-6 odds on favourite in the days before its collapse.
According to Iata, passenger traffic declined by 2.9 per cent year-on-year in September, while cargo traffic, a key 
early indicator of the state of the world economy, fell by 7.7 per cent.
"The deterioration in traffic is alarmingly fast-paced and widespread," says Mr Bisignani. The decline in passenger 
volumes was the worst since 2003, when the industry was hit by the Sars epidemic.
Air cargo accounts for 35 per cent of the value of internationally traded goods and the 7.7 per cent fall in September 
was the biggest monthly year-on-year decline since the bursting of the technology bubble in 2001.

After a wedding party ended in the early hours of the morning a couple of weekends ago, two thirty-something 
female guests making their way back to their hotel were stopped by the police. They were told it was "totally 
unsuitable" for them to be walking at 5am and a taxi was summoned - and dismissed because the driver was also 
deemed "unsuitable."
When the friends whose wedding celebration they had just left bumped into them a little while later, the two women 
were wearing the handsome policemen's blue jackets over their ball gowns and everyone was getting on famously. 
The entire group then went to a nearby bar with the policemen. A couple of hours later, everyone was driven back 
to their hotels in police cars, complete with lights flashing by special request. A couple of days earlier, a cousin of 
the bride's met the mayor on a Ryanair flight. After he learnt of this British wedding party in his city, he sent a 
bouquet of flowers.
I happened to be at this wedding but if I had been asked to guess where in Europe this happened, I would have 
said Palermo. In few other cities in the world do charm - and occasionally chaos - lie so close to the surface of a 
tourist's experience. They say that it is in Palermo that men are most likely to continue the practice of kissing a 
woman's hand. This sense of graciousness extends to visitors. Ask for directions and people will walk out of their 
way to ensure you don't get lost. On my first visit about 10 years ago, I remember an elderly gentleman, all dressed 
up for dinner, following me, worriedly repeating, "Capisce? Capisce?" because he was certain I didn't understand 
enough Italian to follow his directions. Applying for a Schengen visa for Europe recently at the Italian consulate in 
London, I was lucky enough to be facing a Sicilian. He not only expedited the process but sought translation help 
from his colleagues to tell me about the delicacies I shouldn't miss.
The lure of Palermo
My Italian friends look at me, baffled, as I recount stories from visits to Palermo. One who lives in London cut short 
his honeymoon there. His wedding had been on one of the idyllic Aeolian islands, and he found the transition to the 
frenetic traffic and occasional derelict buildings of Palermo too jarring.
My affection for the city has grown into something like an addiction. I now have to ration holidays there because I 
think it unprofessional for a travel journalist to keep returning to a place. Yes, I know the traffic sometimes has all 
the disorder of bees after a hive has broken. And I should be appalled by the crumbling buildings in some parts of 
the city but I am so enchanted by the jumble of architectural styles, from Arab to Byzantine to baroque, that I 
scarcely notice.
This is a city that can claim to have invented multiculturalism. On my first visit, I chanced upon a deconsecrated 
church that looked as if it had once been a mosque, complete with five vermilion cupolas. Sicily's great 12th-century 
monarch, Roger II, was educated by Islamic and Greek tutors. While much of Europe was convulsed by the 
Crusades, he built a kingdom known for its religious tolerance with monuments to match. He entrusted the 
exchequer to Arabs and the leadership of his navy to Greeks and consulted with an Arab geographer from North 
Africa to create a scientific map of the world.
Leave aside the Moroccan-styled ceilings and the fried chickpea flour appetiser served in restaurants that have the 
stamp of the east on them. Even the weather in spring - as Mary Taylor Simeti observes in her book On 
Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal - bears the stamp of a tussle between Europe and Africa: "Dark clouds scud 
back and forth across the sky, caught in a cosmic tennis match played out between the sirocco, the hot wind 
blowing up from the Sahara, and the tramontana, whose gusts have been chilled by Alpine glaciers."
All great cities need great books about them, a soundtrack to the drama of urban life. To my mind, Palermo can 
claim two. Lampedusa's The Leopard  is a novel about Sicily but really about human nature. It is hard not to be 
amused by its wry descriptions of, say, the family priest rushing into the bathroom of the patriarch Don Fabrizio 
before he has had time to put on a bathrobe. (Lampedusa observes that the priest was more comfortable with the 
naked soul than with the naked body). Then there is the great ballroom scene. The nouveau riche Don Calogero 
arrives with his daughter Angelica, "a rat escorting a rose". She is soon entwined with Don Fabrizio's nephew, 
however - "two young people in love dancing together, blind to each other's defects, deaf to the warnings of fate ... 
unknowing actors set to play the parts of Romeo and Juliet by a director who had concealed the fact that tomb and 
poison were already in the script".
This lush yet unsentimental view of Sicily and Palermo is also true of Simeti's book, published in 1986. She arrived 
in Palermo as a young woman from America and, after marrying a Sicilian academic, has lived in Sicily ever since 
(see insider's guide, rightopposite ). I read her book in Hong Kong and so fell in love with Palermo before I had first-
hand experience of it. On Persephone's Island has the flourishes of a novelist that make Simeti's buying of baskets 
of marzipan styled as seafood to her explanation of the intricacies of the city's faulty water supply utterly beguiling.
But what of the Mafia and the incompetence of the city's bureaucracy? In fact, many businesses in the city over the 
past few years have publicly announced they no longer pay protection money to the Mafia; one of the parties for the 
wedding was at a restaurant that was the first to do so. Still, enter a bank, as a friend and I did one Friday 
afternoon, and you will find that, instead of a queue, the customers have collapsed on the sofas as if under a spell.
Every time I go back, though, I find something new to be enchanted by. On this visit, I found - at last - a hotel in the 
city I like everything about. My first drink at the elegant bed and breakfast BB22 the evening I arrived quickly 
became another. The Milanese owner runs the place like an extended house party. She was up at dawn to ensure 
she had her pick of the best flowers at the market for the wedding party.
At brunch at the Villa Igiea, the eccentric grand hotel by the sea, one of the waiters chided me after I waved away 
his offer of pasta from the buffet table, pleading I was putting on weight. A young waiter was summoned and we 
were made to stand side by side and pronounced equally trim. He caught sight of me making my way back to my 
table with a plate of salad and pistachios and I was subjected to more melodrama.
The lure of Palermo
I go to the opera house every time I am there, whether there is a performance or not. This time the guide, 
Salvatore, was urging everyone to try the echo from the centre of one of the public rooms. Had the opera house 
been damaged during the last war? No, he replied and then almost to himself, repeated: "We are so lucky. We are 
so lucky."
It seemed an extraordinary thing to say of an opera house that was closed for 23 years during a restoration dogged 
by corruption and incompetence. Palermo's charm is that it copes with the slingshots of fate with its sense of 
optimism intact.

Ryanair closes Valencia base

Ryanair is closing its operating base at Valencia only a year after its launch after failing to reach agreement on 
marketing support with the local authority.
In a setback to its rapid expansion in the Spanish market, Europe's leading low-cost carrier said the tourism 
department for the Valencia region had failed to "engage in constructive discussions" and had decided to support 
the local carrier Air Nostrum.
The termination of the Valencia operation, the first time Ryanair had closed any of its bases in Europe, would lead 
to a loss of more than 70 weekly flights from November 4 to destinations in the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, 
Spain, France and Malta and the loss of 750,000 passengers a year at the airport.
Ryanair said it had increased its passenger traffic to and from Valencia by more than 25 per cent this year to an 
expected total of 1.5m out of the airport's total of 6m.
It would continue to serve Valencia from some other locations in its remaining network of 30 bases.
The Irish airline, which is already one of the top three European short-haul carriers by passenger numbers, has a 
reputation for very tough negotiations with airports, as it seeks to drive down costs which are already the lowest in 
Europe.
Ryanair said it would move the two aircraft based at Valencia to a new base to be announced next week and said it 
had received "numerous requests" from rival airports.

route to Amsterdam in January.
The entry into the London business market has been made possible by a deal overseen by the Office of Fair 
Trading.

Ryanair is stepping up the attack by European airlines on the Italian market to take advantage of the parlous state 
of Alitalia.
It said it was planning to open two new bases on Sardinia at Alghero and Cagliari, in March next year. The two 
bases will create eight new domestic and 11 new international routes to and from the island.
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said it was also increasing its services between Rome Ciampino and the Milan 
region to five a day from late next month and was adding a new twice-daily domestic service between Rome and 
Trapani in Sicily in December.
Alghero and Cagliari will become the group's sixth and seventh bases in Italy with locally based aircraft in addition 
to Rome, Milan-Bergamo, Pisa, Bologna and Forli.
It said it would base one 189-seat Boeing737-800 in Alghero and would operate a total of 18 routes to and from the 
north Sardinian city with two aircraft based at the Cagliari base offering 19 routes initially.
The latest expansion by Ryanair follows last month's announcement by Germany's Lufthansa that it was moving 
into the north Italian market with a plan to base six Airbus A319 short-haul jets at Milan Malpensa airport in order to 
set up a network of direct point-to-point services between Milan and leading European cities.
The move is the first by the German group to establish a base outside its national market to serve other countries 
rather than to feed passenger traffic into its main hubs at Frankfurt and Munich.
Ryanair widens its attack on the Italian market
Lufthansa said it would begin flights in February from Malpensa to Barcelona, Brussels, Budapest, Bucharest, 
Madrid and Paris. It was planning to add flights from Milan to London and Lisbon from the summer season next 
year.
Lufthansa's Milan-based aircraft will be operated by its Italian subsidiary Air Dolomiti, which hitherto has largely 
acted as a feeder airline into the group's Munich hub.
As the Alitalia operation shrinks amid restructuring and mounting losses several of Europe's strongest carriers are 
rapidly increasing their operations in Italy to take advantage of the vacuum.
EasyJet, the UK low-cost carrier that opened a base at Milan Malpensa in March 2006, is increasing its presence 
from 11 to 15 Airbus A319s by the end of the year.

Virgin Atlantic is reducing the fuel surcharges levied on its economy and premium economy tickets for the first time 
since the crude oil price began falling in mid-July.
The move increases pressure on British Airways to take similar steps to cut air fares. The crude oil price has fallen 
steeply from a record $147 a barrel in July to about $77but until Tuesday both carriers had maintained the fuel 
surcharges at levels set in June.
Air France, the leading European airline, has already lowered its fuel surcharges twice during the autumn to reflect 
the reduced oil price.
BA has come under sustained attack from Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, for leaving the surcharges unchanged 
in spite of the fall in the oil price.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said last week: "BA is using these high and unjustified fuel surcharges as 
a scam to rip off its passengers."
He called on BA to explain why it had lowered its cargo fuel surcharges but left passenger fare surcharges 
unchanged.
BA said on Tuesday its surcharges were "under constant review." The group was still expecting its fuel bill to rise by 
about £1bn ($1.7bn) to £3b this year.
Much of the advantage gained by the fall in the crude oil price had been offset by the decline in the value of the 
pound against the US dollar, BA said.
Virgin Atlantic cuts ticket fuel surcharges
Virgin Atlantic said it was lowering the surcharges on economy fares to £68 from £78 on shorter flights (one way) 
and to £96 from £109 on longer routes including those to destinations on the US west coast, in Asia, Australia and 
South Africa. It has left the surcharges on its business class fares unchanged, however, at £98 one way on shorter 
flights and £133 on longer flights.
BA has kept its surcharges in place to try to sustain its fare levels and offset an increasingly sharp fall in its 
passenger traffic. The airline warned two weeks ago that it would only break even at the operating level for the 
current financial year to end-March, wiping out a record operating profit of £875m last year. BA said forward 
bookings were being affected by "the increased anxiety in financial markets and by the uncertain economic 
outlook".
BA was fined a record £121.5m in August last year after admitting illegally colluding with Virgin Atlantic on the fixing 
of fuel surcharges on long-haul flights to and from the UK between August 2004 and January 2006.

British Airways moved quickly on Wednesday to lower its fuel surcharges levied on economy and premium 
economy fares for long-haul flights, following the lead taken by Virgin Atlantic to reduce some air fares.
The reductions matched exactly the moves made by Virgin Atlantic, its chief long-haul rival out of London.
BA left the surcharges on business class fares unchanged, as did Virgin, and it also failed to lower the surcharges 
on short-haul flights, where Virgin does not compete, despite the big fall in fuel prices since July.
The crude oil price has fallen steeply from a record level of $147 a barrel in July to around $70 on Wednesday, the 
lowest level since September last year. Until this week both BA and Virgin Atlantic had maintained the fuel 
surcharges at levels set in June.
Air France, the leading European airline, has already lowered its fuel surcharges twice during the autumn to reflect 
the lower oil price.
Germany's Lufthansa on Wednesday also announced its first surcharge reductions since the crude oil price began 
to fall three months ago, but unlike BA it reduced the levies on all air fares in all classes and across both its short-
haul and long-haul operations.
BA has come under sustained attack from Ryanair, the Irish low cost carrier for leaving its fuel surcharges 
unchanged for so long despite the fall in the oil price.
BA lowers fuel surcharges for economy fares
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said on Wednesday BA should "end its fuel surcharge scam." The 
decision only to reduce some long-haul surcharges was "just a token gesture" and BA had left the short-haul fuel 
surcharges untouched, he said.
BA said it was lowering the economy fare surcharge for long haul flights of more than nine hours by £13 per flight 
from £109 to £96 per flight (one way). The  economy surcharge for long haul flights of less than nine hours would 
drop by £10 per flight from £78 per flight to £68 one way.
BA said recently it was still expecting its fuel bill to rise this year by about £1bn to £3bn. Much of the advantage 
gained by the fall in the crude oil price had been offset by the decline in the value of the pound against the US 
dollar, it said.
BA has previously kept all its surcharges unchanged in an effort to sustain its fare levels to offset the increasingly 
sharp decline in its passenger traffic, but it moved on Wednesday to close the competitive gap with Virgin.
The airline warned two weeks ago it would only break even at the operating level for the current financial year to the 
end of March, wiping out the record operating profit of £875m achieved last year.

The dry croissants and plastic coffee cups speak volumes about Alain Weill, France's most intriguing media 
entrepreneur.
There is no starched linen, porcelain or basket of pastries such as you might expect from a French chief executive. 
Mr Weill is a no-frills tycoon who is shaking up his country's stolid media industry from a modest office overlooking 
the Paris ringroad.
The 47-year-old Strasbourgeois has created a media empire from scratch, starting eight years ago with the 
purchase of Radio Monte Carlo, which was on the verge of collapse.
He has since added BFM, another radio station; BFM TV, France's first digital television news channel; and La 
Tribune, a business newspaper he bought from Bernard Arnault, the king of luxury.
Next month he will launch Le Sport 10, a cheap sports daily to take on the mighty L'Equipe, the country's biggest-
selling national newspaper and the best-known sports paper in Europe. He has also embarked on some industry-
leading innovation, notably his central sports news agency which distributes sports coverage to all his channels and 
titles.
NextRadioTV, the umbrella company, is relatively small with a turnover of EUR130m ($175m, £103m), but its fast 
growth is remarkable compared to its French peers. Mr Weill is a rare beast in France: a risk-taking innovator in a 
sector dominated by industrial conglomerates and public sector broadcasters.
"I am a media entrepreneur. That sounds banal, but it is something new in France," he says.
France 's media challenger
Such statements do not go down well with France's snobbish media elite who accuse Mr Weill of cheapening the 
profession with an output of commoditised (read American) news journalism. The "low cost" tag, which he invented 
himself to impress his financial backers, plays directly into their hands.
Nonetheless he still believes the description is appropriate. He compares his business with Ryanair, the budget 
airline, saying both have broken into monopoly markets using new technologies to make them more productive 
while investing heavily in new services, but neither, he says, is a "shoestring" operation.
While Mr Weill may resemble Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, in as far as he is an upstart outsider 
beating conservative incumbents at their own game, his manner could not be more different from that of the loud-
mouthed airline boss. Mr Weill avoids the limelight and is quietly spoken - his manner is as dry as his croissants.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
His style sets him apart from others in the media and he wears the rimless glasses of an accountant, and boxy, stiff 
clothes. But he insists it is age rather than character or style that makes him different to others in his industry.
"I come from a younger generation than other media owners, particularly those in television and radio who came 
from the public sector. Often, the news media in France are run by journalists who come from that older generation. 
I am an entrepreneur who came to the media industry with the same approach as media entrepreneurs in other 
countries."
"So I introduced marketing of our journalistic content and a much greater focus on what our readers and viewers 
want, as happens abroad. I draw inspiration from abroad, whereas the other media players are more traditional and 
stuck in their Franco-French ways."
It is his focus on what viewers and listeners want - in contrast to the more top-down approach of conventional 
French media owners - that is key to his commercial success, Mr Weill says.
He believes this approach will see him through the economic slowdown. So far, Mr Weill says, his businesses have 
"not yet suffered much" from the tough market conditions but he expects a "difficult" 2009.
He insists that radio is well-suited to harder conditions because it has low fixed costs and advertisers are attracted 
by its relative cheapness. He also hopes that digital television, which is still a new media in France, will benefit from 
the scrapping of advertising on public television next year and should provide extra revenue to his channels.
Radio has encouraged him to innovate with new formats. He turned RMC into a talk radio station, modelled on 
those in the US. The other main French stations have now followed suit.
Mr Weill is scathing about his counterparts in the media industry, particularly those businesses that are part of 
larger industrial groups, which he describes as a "Franco-French peculiarity".
"It is not a very good system. The owners have different objectives. Development of their media businesses is 
perhaps not a priority, or not the only priority. A group like Bouygues has TF1, Alstom, Bouygues Telecom, it is 
making arbitrages between one and the other."
If France has failed to develop a big pan-European media group it is not because of the weight of regulation at 
home - as many in the industry claim - but because owners are too distracted with other businesses, he says.
"Mr Arnault bought La Tribune 15 years ago but in the end it was not his core business. He concluded he didn't 
have the savoir faire that he has in his own field, where he follows his products and ranges day-to-day with 
uncontestable competence."
France 's media challenger
A specialist in turning around failing news outlets, partly by cutting jobs, Mr Weill has acquired the reputation of a 
ruthless cost-cutter who has broken France's tradition of social partnership. But he is phlegmatic, saying he has 
created far more jobs than he has cut.
"None of this worries me. I'm perfectly at ease. It is the former owners who are to blame. I take no responsibility. I 
take decisions that are painful for some people but help save the economy."
Mr Weill, whose parents were doctors, wanted to be a journalist but ended up studying management at the Institut 
Supérieur des Affaires. He has spent his entire career in broadcasting, first with Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de 
Telediffusion, which owns RTL radio, and then with NRJ, the first independent radio group, first as director of 
programming then as deputy chief executive. When NRJ tried to take over RMC, but was blocked by the regulator, 
he saw an opportunity and seized it.
While first and foremost an entrepreneur, he takes a close interest in his group's content, talking frequently with his 
editors.
"If there is an image I don't like, I say so. But my criticisms are not editorial or political, they are qualitative. It is a 
taboo in France. The owner is not supposed to interfere. I don't call up and say I've had lunch with a minister this 
afternoon who wants to come on. The only criteria are quality and the audience."
Has he ever come under political pressure to change a broadcast or article, like many other media owners? Mr 
Weill chooses his words carefully: "No, but interventions don't shock me either, if it is a question of complaining 
about one of my journalists, when false things are written."
Perhaps being a newcomer gives him more independence? It's a question of mindset, he replies. Many "excellent" 
journalists who spent their careers in public radio and television "have been formatted to compromise with whoever 
is in power. We don't have a long history, which perhaps makes things easier for us."

Blink and JetBird aim to slash private jet costs

The race is on in Europe to test out new business models for low-cost private jet travel.
Undaunted by the difficulties that have recently beset similar ventures in the US, two start-up groups, Blink of the 
UK and Ireland's JetBird, are setting out to make private jet use more affordable offering prices up to 50 per cent 
below those of other operators.
They aim to bring lessons from commercial low-cost carriers, such as Ryanair and EasyJet, into the more rarefied 
corporate jet world, and to exploit a new breed of very light four-passenger jets that are entering the market, Blink 
with the Cessna Mustang and JetBird with the Embraer Phenom 100.
They have already placed orders and options for nearly 150 aircraft for delivery by the end of 2013 from the US and 
Brazilian planemakers.
Blink has been the first out of the blocks.
Peter Leiman, one of the co-founders and a former UBS investment banker, dismissed concerns about falling 
demand from weakening economies in Europe and fears raised by the recent collapse of DayJet, the hugely 
ambitious air-taxi start-up in the US.
DayJet ceased operations two weeks ago after barely a year of flying and after failing to secure critical refinancing. 
It was the world's first "per-seat, on-demand" private jet service.
It had already taken 28 Eclipse 500 very light jets - most are now parked - and had been planning to take delivery of 
300 in the first two years, with the total set to rise to as many as 1,400 in five years.
Blink and JetBird aim to slash private jet costs
Mr Leiman said Blink, now in its fifth month of operation, had avoided the complexity of DayJet, which had invested 
heavily in the development of proprietary software systems. It was selling whole aircraft rather than individual seats 
like DayJet. It had also chosen to buy its planes from Cessna, a long-established jet maker, rather than buying from 
an unproven start-up venture such as Eclipse.
Blink has been founded by Mr Leiman, formerly of UBS, and Cameron Ogden, son of British IT entrepreneur Sir 
Peter Ogden, who was at Goldman Sachs.
Blink raised $30m in equity last December from three private family funds. By mid-November the fleet will have 
grown to four and the plan is to expand to 45 jets by 2012.
Four former British Airways executives have been recruited to lead the operations management.
Blink had flown its first aircraft for 70 hours last month, said Mr Leiman. "It's too early to draw any definitive 
conclusions, but the costs were in line and revenues and utilisation were above the plan," he said. "We will know a 
lot more about this business once we have the next few aircraft in service."
In its best performance to date, it had flown one 11-hour day, with eight separate flights between five countries and 
six cities, with three different customer groups and a change of crew.
JetBird is following fast in the wake of Blink.
Last month it secured EUR10m (£7.78m) in additional equity capital from a Middle East strategic investor, which 
has taken a stake of 9.3 per cent alongside Domhnal Slattery, the Irish financier and founder. The group raised 
EUR21m in December last year through a share placement led by Mr Slattery's Claret Capital, the Dublin-based 
private investment firm.
JetBird is aiming to build a private jet airline and will be the launch customer in Europe for the Embraer Phenom 
100. The plane, still undergoing flight tests, is due to be certified and to enter service in the US before the end of the 
year.
JetBird should take its first delivery in April next year and is due to receive 15 by the end of December 2009. It 
placed a firm order in 2006 for 50, with options for another 50. It is planning to have a fleet of 100 by the end of 
2013.
Mr Slattery said JetBird was aiming to offer private jet services on a "contained network" between 75 European 
airports and eventually intended to have five main operating bases most probably at Cologne/Bonn, London 
Stansted, Paris Le Bourget, Milan and Basel airports. The service will launch first in Germany. It is aiming to begin 
commercial service in June or July next year.
Mr Slattery, former managing director of the structured asset finance business of Royal Bank of Scotland, said the 
group would offer private jet premium service at a much lower price, comparable to business-class travel and 
costing less than 50 per cent of some existing branded private jet services.

28 Eclipse 500 very light jets - most are now parked - and had been planning to take delivery of 300 in the first two 
years with the total set to grow to as many as 1,400 in five years. That was a large part of the total Eclipse order 
book.
Start-ups seek to cut cost of private jet travel in Europe
It has blamed its demise in part on problems at Eclipse Aviation, which is itself struggling to raise additional finance 
and has been forced to cut jobs and pare back production.
Mr Leiman says Blink has avoided the complexity of DayJet and its heavy investment in the development of 
proprietary software systems. It was also selling whole aircraft rather than the per-seat DayJet approach, and it had 
chosen to buy its planes from Cessna, a long-established jet maker, rather than buying from an unproven startup 
venture like Eclipse.
Blink was founded by Mr Leiman and Cameron Ogden, son of British IT entrepreneur Sir Peter Ogden. The young 
investment bankers, formerly with UBS and Goldman Sachs respectively, met while studying for MBAs at Harvard 
Business School.
They brought their first Cessna Mustang into revenue service in June from an initial base at Farnborough, south-
west of London, the leading base for private jet travel in the UK.
Blink raised $30m in equity last December from three private family funds, two from Scandinavia and one from the 
UK, as well as debt to fund its first 30 jets. By mid-November, the fleet will have grown to four, and if the group 
succeeds the plan is to grow to 45 jets by 2012.
Initially it is using TAG Aviation, one of Europe's biggest executive jet charter operators, to fly the planes under the 
existing TAG air operator's certificate, but Mr Leiman says it is working to achieve its own AOC within six months. 
Four former British Airways executives have been recruited to lead the operations management.
Blink has flown its first aircraft for 70 hours last month, says Mr Leiman, showing it could achieve the hoped-for high 
utilisation. "It's too early to draw any definitive conclusions, but the costs were in line and revenues and utilisation 
were above the plan," he said. "We will know a lot more about this business, once we have the next few aircraft in 
service."
JetBird is following fast in the wake of Blink, and the Irish startup is aiming to be the first pan-European operator of 
very light private jets.
Last month it secured EUR10m ($14m) in additional equity capital from a Middle East strategic investor, which has 
taken a stake of 9.3 per cent, alongside Domhnal Slattery, the Irish financier and founder.
The group raised EUR21m in December last year through a share placement with European and US private and 
institutional investors led by Mr Slattery's Claret Capital, the Dublin-based private investment firm founded by Mr 
Slattery in 2005, with himself as the largest shareholder.
JetBird is aiming to build a private jet airline and will be the launch customer in Europe for the Embraer Phenom 
100. The plane is due to be certified and to enter service in the US before the end of the year.
JetBird should take its first aircraft delivery in April next year and is due to receive 15 by the end of December 2009. 
It placed a firm order in 2006 for 50 with options for another 50 of which a further three have since been turned into 
firm orders. It is aiming to have a fleet of 100 by the end of 2013.
Mr Slattery says JetBird is aiming to offer private jet services on a "contained network" between 75 European 
airports and is planning eventually to have five main operating bases -most probably at Cologne/Bonn, London 
Stansted, Paris Le Bourget, Milan and Basel airports. The service is to be launched first in Germany.
The group has arranged debt financing with Royal Bank of Scotland for the pre-delivery instalment payments to 
Embraer for the first 25 aircraft. Mr Slattery says the group is the first very light jet operator to secure independent 
bank pre-delivery financing for VLJs.
It is aiming to complete a deal for long-term aircraft debt financing by November.
Start-ups seek to cut cost of private jet travel in Europe
The group is headquartered in Dublin and will operate under an Irish air operator's certificate. It is aiming to begin 
commercial service in June/July next year.
Mr Slattery, formerly managing director of the structured asset finance business of Royal Bank of Scotland, says 
the group will be able to offer private jet premium service at a much lower price, comparable to current business

Ryanair shareholders attending the company's general meeting in Dublin in September were bemused by a sight 
not often associated with such gatherings, when a bare-chested young man wearing an oxygen mask approached 
the podium where Michael O'Leary, the chief executive, was speaking.
The protestor, with "Exposing O'Leary's Lies" written across his chest, accused the airline chief of denying the 
damage his fleet was causing to the climate. His protest underlined the pressure aviation companies are under from 
the green movement.
All air travel accounts for only a few per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions, but its projected expansion means 
it will become a much bigger source of emissions within 20 years.
Flying also produces much more carbon dioxide than some other forms of transport.
The rising number of short-haul flights to destinations that could be served by railways, which produce less carbon 
per passenger, has been a complaint of environmentalists.
Campaigners say airlines have had unfair tax breaks on fuel that have skewed the economics of travel. Will 
corporate aviation be the next target for protests?
Joshua Blackburn, head of the ethical communications agency Provokateur, says it is unlikely that protestors will 
home in on corporate jets and business travel soon, as they are targeting the industry as a whole rather than 
niches.
Environment: Green issues move up the balance sheet
But he warns that corporate travellers must become more aware of their impact, especially those using company or 
business hire jets.
"Using corporate jets puts you at the front of the queue as far as your carbon footprint is concerned. There isn't 
much else that would make your footprint bigger."
He predicts that such trips will become "socially unacceptable" and that environmental groups will target companies 
that claim to be "green" but continue using "this form of corporate indulgence".
The corporate aviation sector is becoming increasingly aware of the threat to its reputation of failing to deal with 
climate change.
Mr O'Leary called his lone protestor an "eco-looney", but other parts of the industry have taken a more conciliatory 
approach, seeking to reduce the impact of their flights.
For instance, Boeing has worked with seven airlines in the past year - including British Airways, Air France KLM, 
Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines and El Al - on a "performance improvement package" of fuel-efficiency 
technologies that save 1,300 tonnes of carbon dioxide per aircraft per year.
There is an economic advantage, too. Per Noren, vice-president of environmental strategy at Boeing's commercial 
aviation services division, says: "Operational efficiencies become environmental efficiencies and the aviation 
community can contribute to a cleaner future."
But voluntary measures are only part of the picture. Regulation is also increasing, in Europe at least.
Airlines will be covered by the European Union's emissions trading scheme from 2012. They will be allocated a 
fixed quota of carbon emissions, and must buy carbon permits from other groups if they need to emit more.
This will impose large costs. Robert Casamento, a director in the power and utilities team at Ernst & Young, says: 
"Airlines incur very high carbon abatement costs compared with other industrial sectors.
"In addition, many expected technological improvements, such as fuel-efficient engine designs and lighter-weight 
components, will not be in place in time to achieve significant emission reductions before 2022."
A report last year by Ernst & Young predicted that the cost to the European aviation industry of purchasing the 
emissions allowances needed for traffic growth could exceed EUR45bn ($62bn) in the period from 2012 to 2022.
Mr Casamento says this could have the effect of "jeopardising the long-term viability of many airlines and increasing 
the need for further consolidation. Some European airlines are already beginning to develop carbon-hedging 
programs."
The costs will translate directly into higher ticket prices for all travellers.
One aspect of the regulations that is still unclear is the treatment of private and corporate jets. One proposal would 
exempt such flights from the scheme, provided "carbon offsets" are bought to cover the emissions.
Offset schemes allow travellers to cancel out the effect of their emissions by buying carbon credits, which fund 
carbon-cutting schemes, such as wind turbines or solar panels, usually in developing countries. They are already 
used by many corporate travellers and several charter and fractional schemes.
A separate proposal would exempt companies making fewer than 245 flights in four months.
But if corporate and private jets are included, it would "impose a serious administrative burden", says Mark Bissett, 
partner at Stephenson Harwood, a law firm.
Companies would pay a financial penalty in having to buy emissions permits, but more costly would be ensuring 
compliance with the scheme through monitoring emissions and having them independently verified.
Environment: Green issues move up the balance sheet
At least, however, companies could deflect the wrath of environmentalists by pointing to their compliance with the

Worries about company balance sheets have brought suffering to shareholders throughout the year, but two other 
types of market player - the corporate predator and the spread better - have had a better time of it.
Takeover deals, or rumoured deals, have caused share prices of some companies to fluctuate dramatically, and 
speculation about which companies will be the next targets remains rife.
As the predators have circled, spread-betters have had more opportunities for quick profits, thanks to the leverage 
provided by trading bets on margin.
For example, traders with long positions in Alliance & Leicester made significant gains when the share price went 
up 55 per cent, following the takeover by Spanish bank Santander announced in July.
The difficulty, obviously, lies in anticipating a bid.
"After a bid has been made, or speculated about, you rarely see significant price increases," says Josh Raymond, 
market strategist at City Index.
One solution is to try to look for signals.
Adam Seagrave, sales trader at CMC Markets, says: "Cash rich companies can often be attractive targets, so those 
with a healthy balance sheet are worth watching."
Another indicator to look out for, he says, is stake-building - a "classic signal" that one company may be working 
towards a takeover bid for another.
Takeovers: Keep an eye on the signals
Betters can also try to monitor the media to pick up speculation about bids - although being early off the mark is 
crucial.
For example, on July 11, before Santander's 317p-per- share bid was announced, Capital Spreads, a betting 
provider, was quoting a price of 220p-221p for Alliance & Leicester shares. Following bid rumours over the 
weekend, on Monday this had risen to 240.5p-241.5p and then went up to 335p-336p when the takeover was 
announced.
This is unusual, though. Generally, by the time speculation is reported, it is likely the share price will already have 
risen. Even so, there are some trading strategies for making money after a bid is announced.
Prices can continue to go up if the market expects multiple bidders. In this situation, traders can go long after the 
initial announcement; while they may have missed the initial share price rise, they can benefit from any further 
increases as bidders compete.
Conversely, if the market anticipates difficulties for the bidder, prices can often fall after the initial bid euphoria. 
Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, points out that share prices tend to go up on the first day, but 
then drop on the second as traders lock in their gains, or concerns emerge about the takeover.
This provides a short-term intra-day trading opportunity. It was seen most recently after Ryanair's bid for Aer 
Lingus, after fears arose that regulators would not permit the merger.
Mr Raymond argues prices can fluctuate in both directions, as sentiment changes. "You rarely see a stock price 
head consistently in one direction after the initial big move, once a bid has been confirmed," he says. "What you 
commonly see, is prices fluctuate through a general trend to the upside. This see-saw effect creates great 
opportunities."
To make the right call, spread betters need to know the companies involved extremely well. "It's all about knowing 
the correct size, structure and make-up of the target and targeter - and the sector that they are in - to the finest 
detail," says Mr Campbell.
However, if you don't, there are some lower-risk ways to profit. One strategy is to bet on a whole sector: a takeover 
of one company may indicate that others in the sector will be targets, causing valuations to rise across the board. 
This was the case recently in mining and pharmaceuticals.
Another strategy is a "pairs trade" on the two companies involved in a takeover. Mr Seagrave says: "You could buy 
the target company in an attempt to profit from its share price rising whilst selling the bidding company in 
anticipation that its share price will fall."

European stocks rose on Thursday, as rumours circulated that the US Congress had made progress towards a plan 
to revive capital markets.
Investors saw hope in signals from Washington that the legislative impasse over the proposals might come to an 
end soon.
On Wenesday, President Bush warned of "a long and painful recession" if the American Congress failed to enact 
the scheme devised by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve
By mid-afternoon, the FTSE Eurofirst was 0.8 per cent higher at 1,109.09, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax rose 0.7 per cent 
to 6,095.25 while the Paris CAC 40 added 1.2 per cent to 4,161.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per 
cent in early trade to 10965.75.
JPMorgan's forecast that European equities would outperform the Dow Jones in the next eighteen months lifted 
banks higher, with UBS and Credit Agricole 4.8 per cent higher at SFr 21.04 and EUR15.09, respectively. Dexia, 
the Belgian retail bank, climbed 4.7 per cent to EUR10.75.
Natixis shed 5.8 per cent to EUR2.75, however, after the Parisian newspaper Les Échos reported that the French 
bank's chairman Philppe Dupont was stepping down. Fortis
It has been a busy day for insurers as Swiss Re was up 2 per cent at SFr 64.40 after it reaffirmed its targets for the 
financial year, saying that its investment portfolio remained sound in spite of troubled financial markets.
Hopes for US bailout lift European stocks
French insurer Axa and Munich Re's insurance unit ERGO were reported to be mulling the acquisition of a small 
Souh Korean insurer. The Asian country's insurance market is the world's seventh-largest. Shares in Axa climbed 4 
per cent to EUR23.43, while Munich Re added 4.4 per cent to EUR113.57.
Total creeped up 0.2 per cent to EUR43.80 after it revealed a possible takeover bid for Repsol, the Spanish energy 
group.
The French oil giant said it was considering buying Sacyr-Vallehermoso's 20 per cent stake in Repsol, as well as 
the 12.7 per cent stake of savings bank La Caixa, which would oblige it to seek a complete acquisition. Repsol rose 
5 per cent at EUR21.47 while Sacyr was 4.8 per cent higher at EUR12.89.
Ryanair rose 2 per cent to EUR2.51 after Collins Stewart raised its rating for the low-cost airline from "sell" to "hold".
EADS, the French aerospace and defence company added 6.3 per cent to EUR13.52 after reiterating its full-year 
targets, even as it confirmed the first flight of its new A400M aircraft would be delayed.
Virginia Vacca, equity research analyst at Standard and Poor's, said, the spurt in EADS' shares was also because 
of "Boeing's Dreamliner production freeze, with unions still picketing and Air Canada today claiming compensation".

As a small island, Guernsey recognises the importance of tourism. Residents and businesses alike depend on the 
visitor economy to provide a robust transport infrastructure and comprehensive leisure facilities.
In 2006, following years of decline in passenger movements and hotel occupancy, the States developed a new 
strategy focused on access, accommodation and marketing. This strategy is now starting to bear fruit.
Chris Elliott, director of tourism at the commerce and employment department, says: "It can be expensive to get to 
Guernsey, but we have tried to broaden our potential market and make access easier by developing the island's air 
links. New routes tend to be unprofitable in the first couple of years so we have offered subsidies to operators."
The result is that Flybe has launched new routes from the island to Paris Charles de Gaulle and Dublin, while Blue 
Islands has started services to Geneva and Zurich. Although it is unlikely that low-cost airlines such as Ryanair will 
come to Guernsey, given the size of the market and the airport runway, Mr Elliott hopes to encourage further routes 
such as London City.
"With the economic slowdown and high oil prices, airlines are concentrating on survival right now," says Mr Elliott. 
"The price of flights will probably rise, but Guernsey may benefit from its closeness to the UK and the availability of 
slots if airlines fail. We must address urgently the island's runway, which is too small for some aircraft and needs 
upgrading."
With the emergence of the low-cost airlines and the development of European destinations in the 1990s, tourism in 
Guernsey began to wane. Chris Sharp, director of La Fregate Hotel, says: "There was excess capacity in the 
accommodation sector. Falling occupancy levels meant decreasing profits, which led to lower investment at a time 
when customers were becoming more sophisticated."
Tourism: New strategy begins to deliver
The planning laws made it very difficult for hotel owners to change the use of their property. When the legislation 
changed in 2006, three major hotels and several guest houses left the industry, leading to a 5 per cent drop in the 
bed stock.
"Operators have more confidence now and are starting to invest, because they expect to make a return given the 
reduction in total capacity. Standards are improving with the number of four-star hotels up to six," says Mr Sharp. 
The Bella Luce, La Fregate and the Fleur du Jardin have all undergone major refurbishment, while the Red 
Carnation Group has taken over the Old Government House.
The States has also carried out market research to pinpoint the customer base.
"Previously, a large proportion of the £2.4m ($4.3m) marketing budget was misallocated," says Mr Elliott. "Following 
our research, however, we know that 85 per cent of our customers live in the UK, and that they are predominantly 
over-45s who live less than two hours from an airport and are looking for a short break. We can now target our 
advertising accordingly."
The island is fortunate that this demographic is already substantial, growing quickly, and wealthy. "We need the 
island to remain a mass-market destination and not to become exclusive, but this part of the population does 
appreciate Guernsey's finer qualities, such as its status as a genuine, living community and a place of outstanding 
natural beauty," says Mr Elliott.
The latest statistics suggest that Guernsey's tourism market is starting to recover. There has been a 3.5 per cent 
overall increase in passenger movements in the seven months to the end of July, including a 6.2 per cent rise at the 
airport. Occupancy rates are higher in hotels and self-catering accommodation. The average length of stay has 
increased to 4.1 days.
For Mr Elliott, the future holds more of the same. "We are seeking stable growth in visitor numbers. We expect to 
see more visitors from Europe as the new air routes start to prosper, and we will focus more of our future marketing 
on France and Ireland," he says.
Although growth seems to be levelling off as the UK economy slows, there is still a mood of cautious optimism in 
the industry. "Tourism is in much healthier shape now than it was five years ago," says Mr Sharp. "There is nothing 
we can do about a possible recession, the price of oil or even the weather. But we can invest in our air links, quality 
of accommodation and effective marketing, and must continue to do so."

EasyJet said on Wednesday the strength of the euro and a worsening consumer environment in the UK would slow 
the strong growth in revenue per seat it had achieved over the summer.
The low-cost carrier said the market was too volatile to forecast the impact on yields of expected capacity cuts of 2-
4 per cent industry-wide over the winter.
In a statement to the market EasyJet reiterated that its pre-tax profits for the year would be down by some 40 per 
cent at £110m-£120m, excluding £12m of one-off costs.
Revenue per seat has risen by around 15 per cent in the second half, but faced with high fuel costs, adverse 
currency movements and a worsening economic climate, EasyJet will only modestly increase the number of seats it 
offers over the winter, as it tries to defend margins.
The company expects to have cash reserves of £900m at the end of this month.
For the next financial year, EasyJet said it had hedged 48 per cent of its fuel requirements at $1,225 a tonne, a 
sharp increase in volume from the 28 per cent it had hedged by late July, and at a modestly lower price.
It has also hedged 70 per cent of its dollar requirement and 80 per cent of its anticipated euro surplus.
The company is due to give more information to investors and analysts at a presentation later on Wednesday.
The airline first said in March that its profits for this year would be lower but then analysts downgraded their 
estimates by some 25 per cent. When the company suggested in July the fall would be in the order of 40 per cent, 
shares in EasyJet slipped 10 per cent.
Easyjet warns of tough times ahead
Its rival Ryanair has also seen strong passenger figures but serious erosion in its profitability. It has said it could fall 
into a full-year loss for the first time in 11 years.
EasyJet shares were up 4.7 per cent at 375p in early London trading.

EasyJet has warned that the strength of the euro and a worsening consumer environment in the UK would slow the 
strong gains in revenue per seat it had achieved over the summer.
The low-cost carrier, commenting in the light of failures among rival aircraft operators such as Zoom and XL, 
estimated the industry faced a reduction in capacity of between 2 and 4 per cent over the winter. But it said 
conditions remained too volatile for it to forecast how that reduced capacity would help its efforts to protect yields on 
its own flights.
In an update on Wednesday, EasyJet maintained guidance that its pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 
would be down 40 per cent at £110m-£120m, excluding £12m of one-off costs.
Revenue per seat at EasyJet rose about 15 per cent in the second half. But faced with high fuel costs, adverse 
currency movements and a worsening economic climate, EasyJet will only modestly increase the number of seats it 
offers over the winter, as it attempts to defend margins.
For the next financial year, EasyJet said it had hedged 48 per cent of its fuel requirements at $1,225 a tonne, a 
sharp increase in volume from the 28 per cent it had hedged by late July, and at a lower price. It has also hedged 
70 per cent of its dollar requirement at $1.96 to the pound and 80 per cent of its anticipated euro surplus at 
EUR1.24 to the pound.
The airline first warned in March that full-year profits would be lower, then analysts downgraded their profits 
estimates by a quarter. When the company suggested in July the fall would be about 40 per cent, it slipped 10 per 
cent.

European shares fell to a three-year low as fears for the future of AIG, the US insurance group, and a sharp drop in 
profit at Goldman Sachs fuelled the continuing sell-off in financial stocks.
Falling oil and metal prices added further downward pressure.
The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 was down 2.6 per cent to 1,091.38 points, bringing its losses for this week to 
6.5 per cent. The index has lost more than 27 per cent this year.
Natixis, French investment bank, sank 16.1 per cent to EUR2.50, leading the rout in banking stocks as interbank 
lending rates soared.
Another leading faller wasUBS, which lost 17.2 per cent to SFr16.64. The Swiss investment bank said its exposure 
to Lehman Brothers was now substantially closed out and it did not expect the total cost of closing out its remaining 
exposures to exceed $300m.
Germany's Commerzbank lost 12.2 per cent to EUR13.97. Fortis slid 11.5 per cent to EUR7.39, paring losses after 
the Belgo-Dutch bank denied talk of an imminent rights issue. Short-covering and rumours that Spain's Banco 
Popular could be in merger talks with smaller peer Banco Pastor drove the stock up 5.6 per cent to EUR7.53.
Meanwhile, the country's central bank said Spanish banks' exposure to Lehman Brothers was minimal. Banesto 
rose 7.6 per cent to EUR9.51, while Santander edged up 0.2 per cent to EUR10.58.
Meanwhile, storm clouds over AIG subdued the European insurance sector. Swiss Re tumbled 13 per cent to 
EUR54.05, Germany's Allianz fell 5.6 per cent to EUR98.06, while France's Axa lost 2.9 per cent to EUR19.76.
Europe at three-year low as financials drop
Germany's ZEW economic sentiment index indicator came in stronger than expected but provided little comfort for 
equities.
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt fell 1.6 per cent to 5,965.17, while the CAC 40 in Paris slid 2 per cent to 4,087.40.
Oil shares fell after another drop in the price of crude, which hovered at around $93 a barrel.
Norway's StatoilHydro fell 5.2 per cent to NKr131.90, France's Total slid 2.7 per cent to EUR42.22 and OMV in 
Austria lost 9.2 per cent to EUR34.55. Portugal's Galp Energia lost 5.5 per cent to EUR11.24.
The falling oil price gave a boost to Deutsche Lufthansa ,which rose 1.1 per cent to EUR15 but failed to lift budget 
carrier Ryanair, which was flat on the day at EUR2.72.
With few bright spots in the market, traders latched on to talk in the building materials sector that Holcim was the 
target of a takeover.
The Swiss cement maker's shares climbed 3.2 per cent to SFr87 on speculation that Lafarge, the world's leading 
cement group, might make an offer.
Other talk was of Russian stake-building. Shares in Lafarge rose 1 per cent to EUR81.42.
There was also speculation that Spanish construction group FCC could be a bid target after rumours circulated that 
Colonial, the property group, had sold its 15 per cent stake.
Shares in FCC rose 2 per cent to EUR31.74, in spite of Colonial's denial of the sale rumours.
Bid rumours also drove Hermés International up 8.5 per cent to EUR102.94. Luxury groups LVMH and PPR were in 
the frame as possible bidders.
Porsche lifted its stake in Volkswagen to 14 per cent in a move that it said gave it effective control of the German 
carmaker. VW rose 9.4 per cent to EUR226.50. Porsche fell 1.8 per cent to EUR82.90.
Ciba, Swiss speciality chemicals group slid 1.4 per cent to SFr48 after shareholder Bestinver rejected BASF's

Lufthansa plans network from Milan

Lufthansa is moving aggressively into the north Italian market to take advantage of the parlous state of Alitalia.
The heavily loss-making Italian airline was locked in talks with the government, trades unions and potential 
investors about the terms for a last-ditch rescue as its operations were hit again by cancellations and industrial 
action.
The German flag carrier said it was planning to base six Airbus A319 short-haul jets at Milan's Malpensa airport to 
launch a network of direct point-to-point services between Milan and leading European cities.
The move is the first by the German group to establish a base outside its national market to serve other countries 
rather than to feed passenger traffic into its main hubs at Frankfurt and Munich.
Lufthansa said it would begin flights in February from Malpensa to Barcelona, Brussels, Budapest, Bucharest, 
Madrid and Paris. It was planning to add flights from Milan to London and Lisbon from the summer season next 
year.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt, a director of Lufthansa's passenger airline division, said the group would offer Italian customers 
a "reliable" service from Milan.
"The catchment area around Milan Malpensa stretches to the south of Switzerland and economically is one of the 
most important regions in Europe," he said.
Lufthansa said the Milan-based aircraft would be operated by its Italian subsidiary Air Dolomiti, which hitherto has 
largely acted as a feeder airline into the group's Munich hub.
Lufthansa plans network from Milan
The German group has enlarged its ambitions from its previous plan to move into Malpensa with a number of 
locally-based Embraer regional jets.
As the Alitalia operation shrinks amid restructuring and mounting losses, several of Europe's strongest carriers 
including Air France-KLM, EasyJet and Ryanair are increasing their operations in Italy to take advantage of the 
vacuum.
EasyJet, the UK low-cost carrier, which opened a base at Milan Malpensa in March 2006, is increasing its presence 
from 11 to 15 Airbus A319s by the end of the year.
Its Milan network already includes several domestic Italian routes, but it recently announced it would begin a four 
times daily service between Malpensa and Rome Fiumicino from November, challenging the Italian carriers Alitalia 
and Air One on the biggest and most lucrative domestic Italian air route.
Ryanair, the leading European low-cost carrier, which has three operating bases in Italy at Rome Ciampino, Pisa 
and Milan Bergamo, recently announced plans to add two more at Bologna and Forli.
The Irish carrier will start flying seven routes into Bologna from the end of October. It is establishing the operating 
base at the airport in June 2010 with two aircraft, rising to five by 2012, when it forecasts it will be handling 25 
routes and 2m passengers through the city.
A smaller base, with only one aircraft, will be established at nearby Forli next March.

Boeing 's strike delays deliveries to Ryanair

Ryanair said on Tuesday the strike at Boeing's US aircraft assembly plants was  forcing it to postpone the opening 
of its new operating base at Edinburgh, Scotland because of the delay in the delivery of new aircraft.
Europe's leading low-cost carrier, which is one of Boeing's biggest customers for short-haul jets, said the delivery of 
two 787-800s had been "indefinitely delayed" by the strike that began at the weekend and has closed Boeing's US 
aircraft assembly.
Ryanair said it was deferring the opening of the base from September 23 to November 5, when other aircraft in its 
fleet would be freed up for transfer to the Edinburgh routes.
The airline said it was being forced to cancel flights on 11 routes from Edinburgh until November to four 
destinations in Poland, two in Spain, two in Scandinavia as well as to Berlin, Bratislava and Bournemouth.
Ryanair announced in February it was opening its 27th European base at Edinburgh with plans for 19 routes to and 
from the Scottish capital which are expected to handle 1.2m passengers a year.
The forced postponement of the Ryanair base is one of the first clear impacts on airlines from the Boeing strike, 
which could rapidly affect capacity planning at many carriers around the world.
Boeing said at the weekend it would continue delivering aircraft that were completed prior to the strike and would 
continue providing customers with spare parts. It did not intend, however, to assemble planes during the strike.
The strike has halted production of Boeing's 737, 747, 767 and 777 aircraft. It is also likely to force a further delay to 
the launch deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing's long-range, medium capacity jet, that has been dogged by 
Boeing 's strike delays deliveries to Ryanair
supply-chain problems. It is already at least 14 months behind schedule after three delays to its production 
timetable.
Boeing engineers will continue to work on the test 787 aircraft, but the walk-out by about 27,000 assembly workers 
may upset the plan to fly the 787 by December and to start delivering to customers by the third quarter of 2009.

Jim French is a rare sight in today's troubled airline industry - an aviation executive with a relaxed smile.
While many of his rivals are reporting plunging profits, losses or outright bankruptcy, Mr French, chairman and chief 
executive of Flybe, the leading UK domestic airline and one of Europe's biggest regional carriers, on Monday 
announced a 14 per cent rise in first-quarter profits in spite of a 60 per cent increase in its fuel bill.
By taking over BA Connect 18 months ago, Mr French has seized the opportunity to create a single, strong UK 
regional airline out of the motley collection of small carriers acquired by British Airways over the years but never 
properly rationalised and starved of adequate investment.
Flybe has moved quickly to garner the originally estimated cost savings and revenue gains of more than £40m a 
year, while ending BA Connect's £40m annual loss.
It took out 21 per cent of the combined capacity, resulting in almost 500 redundancies. It closed the BA Connect 
operating base at Bristol airport, where the routes were making heavy losses; shut the BA Connect engineering 
base on the Isle of Man; and abandoned the BA Connect headquarters operation in Manchester.
However, in the process it has expanded by about 50 per cent and has created a business that is proving 
surprisingly resilient in the current tough environment.
Flybe has used many features of the low-cost models pioneered by Ryanair and EasyJet but stayed in a regional 
niche just below the radar screens of the big no-frills operators. It has only a modest presence in the overcrowded 
south-east and has developed as one of the biggest operators in the regions with key bases in Southampton, 
How Flybe flew beneath the radar
Exeter, Birmingham and Manchester as well as in Jersey, Belfast, Edinburgh and Glasgow. It also has growing 
bases in Aberdeen, Inverness and Newcastle.
It abandoned a dangerous flirtation two years ago with the idea of going head-to-head with the low-cost carriers on 
key leisure routes and settled on the more defensible niche of domestic routes round the UK regions.
It added continental European city routes to and from these regions through the BA Connect takeover, and has also 
developed its own specialisation of routes linking the UK with the regional French destinations beloved of UK 
second-home owners.
The UK domestic network accounts for 73 per cent of Flybe seats, with European city routes making up 20 per cent 
and European leisure routes only 7 per cent.
Crucially - in particular for coping with the subsequent hugely damaging surge in oil prices - Flybe chose to 
underpin the transformation strategy with ambitious volumes of new-aircraft orders. It is investing $2bn (£1.1bn) in 
60 78-seat Bombardier Q400 turboprops and 14 118-seat Embaer 195 jets from Brazil.
When the BA Connect deal emerged in late 2006 the stream of new aircraft was already flowing and Flybe could 
deploy many of the aircraft on former BA routes rather than build up expensive new routes itself.
Key to the BA deal was securing sufficient - £143m - financing from the global carrier to cushion the transition and 
to finance the disposal of the BA Connect fleet, which was wrongly sized and expensive to operate. The fleet 
transformation will be complete in a year.
Fuel is still only accounting for 23 per cent of Flybe total costs compared with about 40 per cent at many other 
carriers, and passengers have not been deterred by the switch to turboprops.

Flybe bucks trend with 14% profits rise

Flybe, one of Europe's leading regional airlines, increased pre-tax profits 14 per cent during its first quarter from 
April to June in contrast to the declines reported by many carriers around the world.
The leading UK domestic airline has benefited from its successful March 2007 takeover and restructuring of BA 
Connect, the previously lossmaking regional airline subsidiary of British Airways, as well as heavy investment in 
new aircraft.
As a result of the deal, BA, which provided £143m of funding to support the disposal of BA Connect, holds a 15 per 
cent stake in Flybe.
BA is aiming to sell the Flybe holding as part of an eventual initial public offering of the airline.
The regional airline, which was forced to delay its earlier IPO plan in order to take advantage of the opportunity to 
acquire BA Connect, was still targeting a flotation when financial market conditions improved, said Jim French, 
chairman and chief executive.
It has appointed Dresdner Kleinwort and Merrill Lynch as financial advisers.
Flybe is transferring much of its flying to the fuel-efficient Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft, which provides some 
protection from record oil prices. As a result, fuel accounts for a lower share of costs at Flybe than at most of its 
rivals.
Flybe bucks trend with 14% profits rise
While airlines with contrasting business models such as BA, a legacy, full-service network carrier, and Ryanair, 
Europe's leading low-cost carrier, reported falls in profits under the burden of fuel costs, Flybe said its first-quarter 
profits had risen from £10.7m to £12.2m.
First-quarter revenues increased 13.7 per cent from £136m to £155m and passenger numbers rose 18 per cent to 
2m.
The group maintained a 7.9 per cent pre-tax profit margin in spite of a 60 per cent increase in fuel costs year-on-
year in the quarter to £32.7m.
For the financial year to the end of March, the first 12 months of the enlarged business, Flybe said profit had more 
than doubled from £15.3m to £35.4m on an underlying basis before integration and restructuring costs. Revenues 
rose 46 per cent from £368m to £536m.
The operating profit margin increased from 4.8 to 7.1 per cent with the pre-tax margin increasing from 4.2 to 6.6 per 
cent.
Including heavy integration and restructuring costs in the previous financial year Flybe achieved a turnround from a 
reported pre-tax loss for 2006-07 of £16.2m (including the heavy losses at BA Connect) to a profit of £30.4m last 
year.

Flybe, one of Europe's leading regional airlines, increased pre-tax profits 14 per cent during its first quarter from 
April to June in contrast to the declines reported by many carriers around the world.
The leading UK domestic airline has benefited from its successful March 2007 takeover and restructuring of BA 
Connect, the previously lossmaking regional airline subsidiary of British Airways, as well as heavy investment in 
new aircraft.
As a result of the deal, BA, which provided £143m of funding to support the disposal of BA Connect, holds a 15 per 
cent stake in Flybe.
BA is aiming to sell the Flybe holding as part of an eventual initial public offering of the airline.
The regional airline, which was forced to delay its earlier IPO plan in order to take advantage of the opportunity to 
acquire BA Connect, was still targeting a flotation when financial market conditions improved, said Jim French, 
chairman and chief executive.
It has appointed Dresdner Kleinwort and Merrill Lynch as financial advisers.
Flybe is transferring much of its flying to the fuel-efficient Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft, which provides some 
protection from record oil prices. As a result, fuel accounts for a lower share of costs at Flybe than at most of its 
rivals.
Flybe bucks trend with 14% profits rise
While airlines with contrasting business models such as BA, a legacy, full-service network carrier, and Ryanair, 
Europe's leading low-cost carrier, reported falls in profits under the burden of fuel costs, Flybe said its first-quarter 
profits had risen from £10.7m to £12.2m.
First-quarter revenues increased 13.7 per cent from £136m to £155m and passenger numbers rose 18 per cent to 
2m.
The group maintained a 7.9 per cent pre-tax profit margin in spite of a 60 per cent increase in fuel costs year-on-

Ryanair 's passenger volumes soar

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, increased its passenger volumes strongly last month in spite of the 
economic slowdown and weakening growth in demand for air travel across Europe.
The airline said its passenger numbers had increased by 19 per cent in August to 5.8m, almost in line with its rising 
capacity, as it takes a steady stream of new aircraft from Boeing.
Ryanair said that it had flown 55.1m passengers in the past 12 months.
It filled 90 per cent of its available seats in August, the busiest month of the year. This was marginally lower than 
the 91 per cent achieved a year ago but above the average of the past 12 months of 81 per cent.
The Irish carrier has been waging a price war for several weeks to try to stimulate traffic in the coming winter 
months as the market weakens.
Ryanair's underlying profits fell sharply in its first quarter from April to June and it warned that it could fall into loss in 
the full year for the first time since it was floated 11 years ago, under pressure from surging fuel costs and falling air 
fares.
It is reducing capacity at its main bases at London Stansted airport and Dublin airport during the winter season but 
its overall capacity will continue to grow.
British Airways said earlier this week that its passenger traffic had fallen in August despite an increase in capacity 
year on year, underlining the increasingly tough economic conditions facing world airlines.
Ryanair 's passenger volumes soar
BA filled 77.3 per cent of its available seats last month, down from 80 per cent in August last year. The airline last 
month disclosed its first quarter pre-tax profits had fallen 88 per cent and it announced plans to cut flights during the 
winter, to raise air fares, reduce capital spending and to cut jobs through natural attrition in an effort to cope with the 
surge in fuel costs.
BA said this week that market conditions for the industry remained "very difficult with the strong dollar largely 
offsetting the benefit of the recent fall in oil price".

Aer Lingus faces potential cost cuts
Aer Lingus faces potential cost cuts

Dermot Mannion, chief executive of Aer Lingus, has warned that the Irish airline must undertake "fundamental 
change" in order to minimise a "potential EUR100m [£82m, $145m] operating loss in 2009".
The airline is preparing another round of restructuring as it heads into two years of potentially heavy losses.
Mr Mannion says Aer Lingus cannot afford the traditional protracted negotiations with its trades unions.
It took about 18 months and several strike threats to negotiate the latest productivity improvements, aimed at saving 
EUR20m a year and implemented earlier this year.
The global airline industry is under heavy pressure from high oil prices and weakening demand and more than 25 
carriers have already collapsed this year. Most recently, Italy's Alitalia was put into administration last week, while 
Zoom Airlines, the Anglo-Canadian airline that was trying to develop low-cost long-haul services between London 
and the US, was forced to cease operations last week.
In an interview with the FT, Mr Mannion said that Aer Lingus intended to be one of the industry survivors thanks to a 
strong balance sheet with net cash of EUR803m at the end of June.
It was even planning substantial investment - placing new orders for more short-haul jets from 2010 and the 
establishment of its first operating bases in Britain or continental Europe.
But in the short term further changes were needed in the operating cost base to help ensure long-term viability.
"We will be coming with a new package of measures by the end of September," said Mr Mannion. "Everything is up 
for review. The challenge must be faced quickly.
Aer Lingus faces potential cost cuts
"Fundamental change must happen. We must take out costs to reduce a potential EUR100m operating loss in 
2009."
He would give no details of planned cutbacks, but made a pointed comparison between the EUR80-a-seat it costs 
Aer Lingus to run a short-haul flight, with EUR60 at EasyJet and EUR40 at Ryanair, with the biggest differences 
being in labour and sales and distribution.
Last week Aer Lingus disclosed that in the first half of this year it had fallen to an operating loss of EUR22.3m from 
a profit of EUR2.6m in the same period last year, largely as a result of an increase of EUR56.5m, or 48.7 per cent, 
in fuel costs.
At best the airline expected to break even in the second half of the year - traditionally it makes the lion's share of its 
profits from July to September - implying a pre-tax loss for this year of more than EUR20m.
Weakened by its financial performance, Aer Lingus has been under heavy attack from Ryanair, ever since Europe's 
largest low-cost carrier failed in a takeover bid launched two years ago.
The takeover was blocked last year by the European Commission on competition grounds, a decision Ryanair is 
still fighting in the European courts.
Ryanair, the biggest Aer Lingus shareholder with a stake of 29.8 per cent, earlier this week renewed its attack on its 
smaller rival, claiming that Aer Lingus's cost reduction strategy had been "an abject failure" and that it believed the 
current board and management could "not deliver fundamental changes" in the cost base.
Ryanair said: "As the current wave of European airline mergers and takeovers gathers pace, it is clear that Aer 
Lingus is being marginalised on the sidelines of European aviation, losing money with no apparent strategy to 
return to profitability."
Since Aer Lingus was floated in September 2006 its share price has fallen 26 per cent - though Ryanair's 
performance in the same period has actually been worse, falling 32 per cent. In the past 12 months Aer Lingus has 
fallen 37 per cent and Ryanair 46 per cent. Ryanair, too, has warned it could fall into loss in its current financial 
year.
Mr Mannion dismissed Ryanair's attack on the performance of Aer Lingus's new operating base in Belfast, and said 
it had filled far more seats than claimed by Ryanair, which itself did "not have one route making money out of 
Belfast".
Aer Lingus is already taking action to reduce capacity on its long-haul routes to the US from the end of October to 
try to reduce losses. Mr Mannion said there could be more cuts to come.
The airline is also deferring some new aircraft deliveries from Airbus, as it seeks to slow its planned capacity 
growth.

Commerzbank led European shares downhill after it agreed to buy Dresdner Bank from insurance group Allianz. 
Meanwhile, oil and metal prices lost ground, hitting resource stocks.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.5 per cent to 1,189.35, Germany's Xetra Dax was flat at 6,421.80 and in France the 
CAC 40 slid 0.2 per cent to 4,472.13.
Investors gave the thumbs down to the EUR9.8bn ($14.3bn) Dresdner purchase, sending Commerzbank tumbling 
10.2 per cent to EUR18.04 on fears the German bank had overpaid. Allianz was a touch higher at EUR114.14.
Elsewhere in Europe, banks painted a mixed picture with France's BNP Paribas up 0.6 per cent to EUR61.84 and 
Credit Suisse rising 0.6 per cent at SFr51.45 while Swiss investment banking rival UBS lost 0.9 per cent to 
SFr23.92.
Sliding metal and oil prices and concern about slowing global growth sent European commodities stocks skidding 
downward.
Metals prices slid across the board, sending France's Eramet down 6.9 per cent to EUR349.74. Meanwhile, 
Swedish steel producer SSAB lost 2.2 per cent to SKr154.50 and Norwegian aluminium maker Norsk Hydro lost 3.8 
per cent to NKr55.80.
France's ArcelorMittal fell 1.9 per cent to EUR52.72, but Credit Suisse said the stock would likely perform well 
ahead of its investor day which will be held later this month.
Commerzbank leads European bourses lower
The event would provide a platform for another very confident and reassuring set of management presentations, 
just what the market needed at a time of investor uncertainty about the global steel market, the broker said.
Oil companies also retreated, with Norway's StatoilHydro down 4.3 per cent to NKr160.30, France's Total 2.7 per 
cent lower at EUR47.93. Italy's Eni lost 1.4 per cent to EUR21.92, Austria's OMV dropped 2.4 per cent to EUR42.70 
and Portugal's Galp Energia lost 1.9 per cent to EUR13.47.
The easing oil price gave a lift to airline stocks. Air-France KLM rose 3.3 per cent to EUR17.02, Deutsche Lufthansa 
added 2.1 per cent to EUR15 and Ryanair gained 0.4 per cent to EUR2.6.
Michelin rose to the top of the leaderboard, up 5.4 per cent to EUR46.77 after Merrill Lynch upgraded it from 
"neutral" to "buy".
"It could hardly have been worse for Michelin since last September with input costs up sharply and replacement 
volumes down, forcing two profit warnings in 2008," said Merrill in a note.
However, hard times have knocked the shares down 45 per cent and 2008-2009 consensus earnings estimates 
over 30 per cent lower, driving valuation "back to attractive levels", the broker said.
Registrations of new passenger cars in France continued to grow at a clip in August, in stark contrast to the sharp 
slowdown in other European car markets. The news gave a lift to the European auto sector. Italy's Fiat gained 2.4 
per cent to EUR10.84 and France's Peugeot rose 3.4 per cent to EUR33.61, while Germany's BMW drove up 1.3 
per cent to EUR28.35
French telecoms group Alcatel-Lucent continued its upward charge rising 3.7 per cent to EUR4.30, bringing its 
gains over the past two weeks to 14 per cent. The shares have rebounded on hopes the company is close to 
announcing the appointment of a well-regarded former chief operating officer as chief executive.
Meanwhile, French utility GdF Suez rose 1.5 per cent to EUR40. The company, created in July by the merger of 
French state-controlled gas giant Gaz de France SA and Franco-Belgian utility Suez, said that first-half net profit 
rose 14 per cent, helped by rising energy sales and high market prices.

Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, has signed up to become the new face of WeightWatchers. He 
replaces Sarah, Duchess of York, who was asked to leave after snacking on family-size packs of Doritos.
In a move that the Tories hope will shore up their support among women secretly meeting in village and church 
halls up and down the country, the MP for South Cambridgeshire is to front a new campaign that, he explains, "will 
tell it like it is". For too long, "fatties have blamed the environment, their friends and junk food companies", he will 
say to chubby, velour tracksuit-wearing dieters. The shadow minister is to tour WeightWatcher meetings with his 
hard-hitting political message: "There are no excuses for being fat."
The Conservative shadow cabinet is rumoured to have toyed with promoting the champagne diet, which 
recommends quaffing Dom Pérignon at breakfast, but ruled it out on the grounds that it was inconsistent with their 
anti-binge-drinking stance and the fact that no one outside the party could afford it.
Encouraged by the past popularity of the Atkins diet and Cabbage Soup regime, the Tories believe that, by standing 
on a "shaping up to be bikini fit" platform, they will be swept to power.
The Conservatives' diet is believed to have been influenced by shadow chancellor George Osborne's heroes, 
Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. In fact Mr Lansley's recent speech, which asserted that "people who see more 
fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight", appeared to be a straight lift from the US 
professors' book, Nudge.
Strategists predict that if the nation is put on a strict diet, voters will be too hungry to realise the Tories have not 
bothered to have policies on more head-hurty issues like the economy or tax. Moreover, the Conservative party 
UK Tories seem a bit thin on policy
hopes to woo the business vote, by relieving junk food companies of responsibility and shifting blame on to the 
electorate.
A spokesman for WeightWatchers said last night they were "dead chuffed" by the signing. "There are synergies 
between us and the Tory party," he explained. "Many of our women in the provinces also attend local Conservative 
Associations."
Analysts believe that the slimming group's long-term plans are to turn local Conservative coffee and cake mornings 
into weigh-ins, perhaps offering a diet trifle - a grapefruit with a whirl of reduced-fat cream on top - for the slimmest 
fundraiser of the week.
No-frills thrills
If only passengers on the Ryanair Bristol-to-Barcelona flight forced to make an emergency landing this week had 
paid attention to the safety notices. They were, after all, written clearly in crayon on the back of the seat in front of 
them. Then they would have known that when the aircraft lost cabin pressure over France and plunged from 
30,000ft to 8,000ft in a matter of seconds, instead of panicking, the correct emergency procedure was to punch the 
windows open and flap their arms to keep the aircraft aloft.
Such initiatives are just one of a number of fuel-efficient measures being trialled by the budget airline in a bid to 
maintain profitability in the face of rising oil prices. Another under consideration is double-booking the flights and 
flinging excess passengers out in mid-air.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, is encouraging employees to "think outside the box", although not in 
work time.
One idea is to dispense with the aircraft altogether and just have giant catapults daubed in the company's yellow 
and blue. Passengers will be encouraged to load up on £10 mini-packs of Pringles in order to gain extra momentum 
before boarding the human sling.
At the stroke, sob
So farewell to Accurist's speaking clock. After 22 years, the watch company is ending its sponsorship, after the 
number of calls fell from 250m a year two decades ago to just 70m, which still seems a lot. Instead, the watchmaker 
is launching an online clock that will use the faces and voices of Britain recorded across the country. Anyone can 
turn up to the filming booths to audition for a time-telling spot. Let's hope that they don't follow the same narrative 
arc as The X Factor, in which candidates are expected not just to perform but to out-trump each other with tales of 
the most miserable childhood, which results in made-up foster parents and jail sentences. The nation's nerves 
couldn't take it.

Thomas Cook, the tour operator, is in discussions with rival Tui Travel and the airline Lufthansa about a possible 
merger of their respective low-cost and charter carriers, a move that would create a new rival for Ryanair, EasyJet 
and Air Berlin.
In the latest example of how record fuel costs are forcing a restructuring of Europe's aviation industry, the three 
German-controlled companies said they were in talks about joining Condor, Tuifly and Germanwings.
Tui and Lufthansa have for months been looking at various merger options to rid their balance sheets of non-core 
aviation assets. Thomas Cook joined the talks after Air Berlin last month scrapped plans to buy Condor, blaming 
deteriorating economic conditions.
News of the talks comes as airlines are facing a big increase in fuel costs and a worsening economic outlook. More 
than 25 carriers around the world have collapsed into bankruptcy, and many are seeking cost-cuts through mergers 
or a reduction in capacity.
A Condor-Tuifly-Germanwings tie-up would create a mixed charter and low-cost carrier akin to Air Berlin, the largest 
discount carrier in Europe after Ryanair and EasyJet.
Although the three companies said talks were at an early stage and there could be no certainty of a deal, Alex 
Paterson, an analyst at Liberum Capital, said if successful, a merger would be "excellent news" for the tour 
operators.
Ryanair and EasyJet face threat of new rival
"[It would remove] excess capacity from the short-haul market and reducing significant cost duplication that should 
provide incremental savings over and above those announced in the merger of Thomas Cook and MyTravel and 
Tui and First Choice," he said.
But, like other analysts, Mr Paterson said a tie-up would probably attract lengthy regulatory scrutiny, given that Tui 
and Thomas Cook are Europe's biggest travel groups and Germanwings is run by the biggest airline in Germany.
Soundings from Germany's cartel watchdog may have contributed to the collapse of the Air Berlin-Condor deal.
Shares in Thomas Cook rose 3.5 per cent to 222½p. The company is majority owned by Germany's Arcandor. Tui 
Travel, controlled by Germany's Tui AG, gained 2.5 per cent to 209p.

Germany's Lufthansa took the next steps on its mission to become one of Europe's dominant scheduled carriers by 
pitching to take over Brussels Airlines and putting its low-cost carrier Germanwings up for a three-way merger.
The airline said it was in talks to buy 45 per cent of Brussels Airlines for EUR65m ($95.7m) and take an option to 
buy the remaining 55 per cent in 2010.
Lufthansa had already flagged its intention to make the most of the oil shock hurting the global airline industry by 
trying to pick up bargains. It said the Brussels-based operation would bring new routes in Europe "and in particular 
to Africa".
Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and British Airways are all jostling for position in the huge - but still fragmented - 
European market. The German and French rivals are considered favourites to take a dominant stake in Austrian 
Airways, which the Austrian government wants to sell.
Lufthansa also announced that it and German-controlled travel groups Thomas Cook and Tuiwere discussing 
merging theirlow-cost and charter carriers, Germanwings, Condor and Tuifly, in an attempt to shed non-core assets.
The trio of German companies has been looking at merger options for some time in efforts to rid their balance 
sheets of non-core aviation assets and reduce their exposure to the charter and low-cost sectors they no longer 
like.
Airlines worldwide have been hit by high fuel prices and many are seeking to cut costs through mergers.
Lufthansa gears up European expansion strategy
A Condor-Tuifly-Germanwings tie-up would create a mixed charter and low-cost carrier akin to Air Berlin, the third-
largest discount carrier in Europe after the UK's Easyjet and Ireland's Ryanair.
The announcements came as an added blow to Air Berlin, which reported that fuel costs lowered earnings before 
interest and taxes by a quarter year on year in the second quarter.
The carrier has been hit by record fuel prices. As jitters about its prospects grew - and murmurs from Germany's 
cartel watchdog - Thomas Cook walked away from a deal to merge Condor, its charter airline, with Air Berlin in July.
Joachim Hunold, Air Berlin's chief executive, said authorities would have "big doubts" about the proposed three-way 
deal - Tui and Thomas Cook are Germany's biggest travel groups and Germanwings is run by its biggest airline. He 
said consolidation would "not change much" for Air Berlin and again pledged that his airline would make a small 
operating profit in 2008.
Over the summer, Air Berlin said it would suspend services to China and New York and cut its European timetable 
this winter. Mr Hunold gave no sign when these services would resume.

A last-minute rally in banking stocks and a wave of takeover speculation boosted European shares, but failed to 
cancel out their losses from the start of the week.
The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 jumped 1.8 per cent to 1,175.79, but ended down 1.2 per cent on the week.
Dutch logistics firmTNT stood out, gaining 6.9 per cent to EUR26.45 on rumours that US rival United Parcel Service 
was preparing to make a bid at the weekend.
Takeover speculation has surrounded TNT for two months, with FedEx also in the frame as a potential suitor. The 
shares fell nearly 18 per cent on July 25 after FedEx was reported to have pulled out of talks.
Meanwhile, Hochtief, the German construction group, gained 8.5 per cent to EUR54.34 on speculation that Spanish 
builder ACS, which owns 25 per cent, was interested in Hochtief's US, Australian and Asian divisions. ACS shares 
rose 2.5 per cent to EUR30.20 after the company denied that it had break-up plans for the company. It refused to 
comment on whether it would make a full takeover bid for Hochtief.
Financials provided much of the upside for European stocks, rallying after recent sharp losses. Switzerland's UBS 
gained 4.8 per cent to SFr22.86, putting it 3.6 per cent higher over the week.
However, the rally was an isolated bright spot for the European banking sector this week. Fears for the health of the 
government-backed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the US had cast a pall over banks and 
other businesses exposed to Europe's property market.
Banks to the fore as Europe advances
Irish banks took a battering, with Anglo Irish Bank down 12.9 per cent to EUR5.53 over the week, Bank of Ireland 
falling 13.5 per cent to EUR5.25 and Allied Irish Banks sliding 5 per cent to EUR8.22. Irish cement producer CRH 
also slid 7 per cent to EUR16.97.
Spanish banks and construction companies also faltered. Sacyr Vallehermoso shed 7 per cent to EUR12.32, Banco 
Popular lost 4.9 per cent to EUR7.01 and Grupo Ferrovial lost 5.3 per cent to EUR33.36. Ferrovial was hurt by fears 
that its subsidiary BAA will have to sell three of its British airports this year after a report by UK competition 
authorities attacked its dominance of the industry.
Airlines stocks had a bumpy descent as the oil price rallied. Deutsche Lufthansa lost 5.5 per cent to EUR14.44, Air 
France-KLM slid 5.6 per cent to EUR16.43, while budget airline Ryanair sank 10.2 per cent to EUR2.56.
However, oil and mineral stocks crested the gainers list. Portugal's Galp Energia rose 4 per cent to EUR13.71, 
France's Total added 3.3 per cent to EUR49.17 and Norway's StatoilHydro gained 8.2 per cent to NKr165.60 and 
Austria's OMV climbed 4.1 per cent to EUR42.42.
Mining group Eramet advanced 11 per cent to EUR363.16, while German steel company Salzgitter rose 5.1 per 
cent to EUR103.32.

The Competition Commission's report on BAA was welcomed by airlines and competing airports, but it was strongly 
attacked by BAA itself.
Colin Matthews, BAA chief executive, said the Commission risked "creating uncertainty, delay and confusion at 
exactly the wrong time," just as the government was about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full-
length runways being built in the south-east of England since the second world war.
He said the group was seeking urgent clarification of government policy for aviation and attacked the "flawed" 
analysis of the Commission's report.
Manchester Airports Group, the biggest UK owned airport operator, said the report was "good news for passengers 
and airlines" and said it was interested in acquiring "one or more of the BAA airports."
Jim Callaghan, director of legal and regulatory affairs at Ryanair the biggest low cost airline in Europe and a vocal 
opponent of BAA, said the report showed the market power of the BAA monopoly.
"Competition works - monopolies don't," he said. BAA's monopoly control over the London airports has been highly 
detrimental to competition and consumers.
"BAA has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient, gold plated 
facilities, encouraged by an ineffectual regulator, the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority)."
BAA attacks 'flawed' analysis
Mr Matthews said the group would be seeking "urgent clarification" from the government of how it believed the 
findings of the Commission's report could be reconciled with the air transport policy it had established in the 2003 
aviation white paper.
He said the Commision's findings had to be "assessed in the light of the urgent need for new airport capacity and a 
modern regulatory framework, as well as the need - which we recognise - for improved service from the airport 
operator."
The Commission had found it was the lack of runway capacity that was a main reason for what it called "the current 
poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption," which resulted in regular delays, he said.
By calling not just for a fundamental restructuring of BAA but also for a review of the 2003 air transport white paper, 
the Commission risked delaying the delivery of new runways "making better customer service less, not more, 
likely."
This was not the end of the Competition Commission process, and BAA would continue to point out "the many 
areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter-productive," 
said Mr Matthews.
In Scotland the Commission had "apparently ignored" the evidence presented by BAA and numerous respected 
third party organisations, that clearly demonstrated that Edinburgh and Glasgow airports served separate markets 
and "therefore do not and would not compete, regardless of ownership," he said.
Ryanair's David O'Brien, chairman of the airlines consultative committee at Stansted, said the report had confirmed 
the BAA monopoly was "bad for consumers and bad for Britain," and that it was "an over-charging, poor service 
monopoly."
He said, "The liberation of Stansted airport from the dead hand of the BAA monopoly will be a great first step in the 
recovery of UK aviation, which for far too long has suffered gross inefficiencies, long queues and high costs.
"It is essential that competition within and between London airports is promoted, along with effective regulation, to 
the benefit of passengers, tourism and the economy."
Investors in Ferrovial, the Spanish owners of the UK airport operator, also welcomed the report.
Shares in Spain's second-largest construction and infrastructure company by market value were up 1.2 per cent, or 
EUR0.41, at EUR33.75, one of the top performers of the country's key IBEX-35 index.

and "therefore do not and would not compete, regardless of ownership," he said.
The Department for Transport said it remained committed to the sustainable delivery of new airport capacity, as 
outlined in its White Paper five years ago.
"Government policy has to take account of a range of issues, in addition to competition and market issues," a DfT 
spokesman said.
"The White Paper provides a strategic framework for developments in aviation and to allow those with an interest to 
plan ahead," he added.
Ryanair's David O'Brien, chairman of the airlines consultative committee at Stansted, said the report had confirmed

EUR0.41, at EUR33.75, one of the top performers of the country's key IBEX-35 index.
But Unite, which represents more than 75,000 civil aviation workers in the UK, said any break-up of BAA could lead 
to job losses and a deterioration in working conditions.
"Any attempt to break up BAA will be resisted. This union and our members will not sit back while the market plays 
games with their jobs and their terms and conditions of employment," said Steve Turner, national secretary of Unite.
In a column in Wednesday's Financial Times Mr Matthews and Sir Nigel Rudd,  chairman of BAA, called on the 
industry to consider the strategic issues facing the airline industry and not just the UK operator's market share.
"Recently debate has been confused," they wrote in a column, "by what we believe to be red herrings."
"Regulation needs to encourage long-term investment, recognise environmental responsibility and reward quality as 
well as quantity."

BAA, the embattled owner of Heathrow, was on Wednesday facing the threat of a forced sale of three of its British 
airports next year after a damning report by competition authorities attacked its dominance of the industry.
The company lashed out at the Competition Commission for recommending the forced sale of two of its three 
London airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted - and either Glasgow or Edinburgh in Scotland. The most likely 
candidates for sale are Gatwick, Stansted and Glasgow, analysts said.
BAA chief executive, Colin Matthews said the watchdog's proposals were "flawed" and would create "uncertainty, 
delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time", coming just months ahead of a government decision on whether to 
build a third runway at Heathrow.
The watchdog's far-reaching proposals raise the prospect of a bidding war in an industry built around Heathrow, 
one of the world's busiest airports and a leading hub for international trade and business travel.
Christopher Clarke, commission enquiry chairman, said the sale could take place within six months of the 
completion of the investigation in March next year.
The commission report questioned official policy on airports and will be read in some quarters as an indictment of 
20 years of regulation of a strategic asset by the government, which scrambled on Wednesday to rebut the 
criticisms.
The findings - which will now be put out for consultation - raise questions about the wisdom of Ferrovial's 2006 
purchase of BAA for more than £16bn, including debt. Ferrovial, which had net debt of EUR30.2bn in December 
2007, may find it difficult to sell assets given the squeeze in financial markets.
BAA slams 'flawed' watchdog report
Ferrovial's shares closed down just 2 cents at EUR33.34.
The commission's report, which heralds the biggest shake-up in the airport industry since BAA's privatisation in 
1987, was welcomed by critics of the group. BAA has been battered by prolonged criticism over delays and the 
quality of its facilities.
Ryanair's David O'Brien, chairman of the airlines consultative committee at Stansted, said the report confirmed the 
company's near-monopoly was "bad for consumers and bad for Britain".
BAA holds a 60 per cent market share of all passengers passing through British airports, rising to 84 per cent in 
Scotland and 90 per cent around London, according to commission data.
Mr Clarke said bringing in new owners for some London and Scottish airports could lead to new routes being 
offered, pricing structures being reformed and more money being pumped in.
He said: ""That will drive more efficient capital investment, and better focus on levels and quality of service," he 
said.
Mr Clarke said the jibe of "Heathrow hassle" had "come into play" during the inquiry, which has unfolded amid 
passenger complaints and the disastrous opening of the airport's terminal five in March.
The commission has twinned its proposals for airport sales with a recommendation for a review of the government's 
2003 air transport white paper, which Mr Clarke said had placed "unintended" constraints on investment.
The CBI, the business lobby group, said it would be "wrong" to review the white paper, as this could risk delaying 
the additional airport capacity that the UK was "so badly in need of".
The Department for Transport defended its aviation policy, which it said looked beyond solely market concerns and 
took into account "the need for growth and local social and environmental considerations".

Ferrovial, one of Spain's biggest construction groups, was on Wednesday facing the threat of a forced sale of three 
of its British airports next year, after a damning report by UK competition authorities attacked its dominance of the 
industry.
The UK Competition Commission provisionally concluded that Ferrovial's subsidiary, BAA, should be forced to sell 
two of its three London airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted - and either Glasgow or Edinburgh in Scotland. 
The most likely candidates for sale are Gatwick, Stansted and Glasgow, analysts said.
The watchdog, which has been examining whether BAA's near-monopoly of airports in important regions harms 
airlines and passengers, said the sales could take place within six months of it completing its investigation in March 
next year.
The proposals raise the prospect of a bidding war in an industry built around Heathrow, one of the world's busiest 
airports and a leading hub for international trade and business travel.
BAA - battered by criticism over delays and the quality of its facilities, especially at Heathrow - attacked the 
Competition Commission for "creating uncertainty, delay and confusion".
The commission's findings - which will now be put out for consultation - raise questions about the wisdom of 
Ferrovial's purchase of BAA for more than £16bn (EUR20bn), including debt, in 2006. Ferrovial, which had net debt

Air travellers are facing severe disruption over the August bank holiday because of strikes over pay by baggage 
handlers and check-in staff at Gatwick and Stansted.
The airports are due to be hit by two one-day stoppages: the first on August 25 with a second 24-hour strike 
planned for August 29. Workers at Manchester,Birmingham and Newcastle airports are also to be balloted, 
according to Unite and GMB, the workers' unions.
The dispute involving more than 500 baggage handlers and staff employed by Swissport threatens a large 
proportion of flights at Gatwick and Stansted. Swissport is owned by Ferrovial of Spain, which also owns BAA, 
operator of Gatwick and Stansted. BAA, which also owns Heathrow, is under investigation by the Competition 
Commission.
Unite, the country's biggest union, said that the Gatwick stoppage "would halt all baggage-handling and check-in 
operations at Virgin Atlantic, Monarch, Thomson Fly, First Choice, North West, Air Malta, Air Transat, Oman Air as 
well as some smaller airlines."
At Stansted, "the strike will impact EasyJet, Ryan-air, First Choice, Thompson and others," it said. EasyJet and 
Ryanair account for about 80 per cent of flights at Stansted.
The union said the Swissport workers had rejected a "paltry'' 3 per cent offer complaining that it was well below the 
inflation rate of 5 per cent, as measured by the retail price index.

BAA faces the threat of being forced to sell two of its three London airports under plans to be published by the 
competition watchdog next week, the Financial Times has learnt.
The Competition Commission's provisional findings in its 16-month probe into BAA include a proposal to strip it of 
all but one of its Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted operations, people familiar with the matter say.
The plan, part of a menu of possible reforms to counter BAA's market dominance, is the most striking sign yet of the 
investigation's potentially alarming consequences for Ferrovial, BAA's embattled Spanish owner.
Ferrovial may face having to break up the network of seven British airports, including near-monopolies in the south-
east and Scotland, that underpinned its purchase of BAA for more than £10bn less than three years ago.
BAA holds a 60 per cent market share of all passengers passing through British airports, rising to 84 per cent in 
Scotland and 90 per cent around London, according to commission data.
Some leading business people and airlines, such as Ryanair, are likely to welcome the commission's proposals. 
They say BAA's dominance is disastrous for passengers since it stymies investment in fresh capacity.
The watchdog's report will inspire months of debate about the future of important economic assets that are in crisis 
because of flight delays, under-investment and a lack of long-term planning since BAA was privatised more than 20 
years ago.
BAA could lose two London airports
The commission will consider the London airport sales plan alongside other options to break BAA's grip by means 
of less severe asset disposals and tighter regulation, people familiar with the matter say. Another proposal would 
force BAA to sell either Glasgow or Edinburgh airport.
The watchdog has to publish its final conclusions within eight months. Both the commission and BAA declined to 
comment.
Ferrovial is on Monday finally expected to complete the refinancing of the debt put in place to back its buyout of 
BAA. The restructuring has taken two years and was intended to enable the sale of one or more airports.

Stocks in London were higher at the open with sentiment lifted by falling commodity prices, but gains were capped 
by weaker miners and oil companies.
In early trade, the FTSE 100 was up 22 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 5,520.1. The FTSE 250 added 0.5 per cent to 
9,176.6.
Michael Page, the recruitment agency, fell after it announced it was ending discussions and rejecting a £1.3bn 
unsolicited approach from Swiss rival Adecco. The Michael Page board said that Adecco's offer "materially 
undervalued" the company.
The shares initially lost 4.5 per cent to 320p, but recovered to stand just 0.5 per cent lower at 333p after Adecco 
said there was still scope for a combination with Michael Page which would benefit both companies and their 
shareholders. It added that a further announcement would be made when appropriate.
Miners were hit by falling metals prices. Nickel dropped 2.6 per cent on the London Metal Exchange, while copper 
and zinc also fell. Meanwhile gold fell nearly 2 per cent, back below $800 an ounce.
The two biggest fallers were the pair of Kazakh miners. Eurasian Natural Resources fell 2 per cent to £10.16, while 
Kazakhmys lost 2.4 per cent to £12.32.
The sell off in the energy markets also resumed, pushing Nymex crude oil back below $114 a barrel. BG Group 
eased 0.4 per cent to £11.10, and BP lost 0.4 per cent to 525p.
London lifted as commodity prices fall
But companies with high exposure to fuel costs were better off, and cruise operator Carnival rose 2.2 per cent to 
£19.57, while British Airways, which on Thursday announced plans to join forces with American Airlines and Iberia, 
added 3 per cent to 261p. Budget airline Easyjet climbed 3.2 per cent to 366p, while larger rival Ryanair jumped 
more than 4.5 per cent to EUR2.77.
One of the biggest factors in the commodity sell off was the rising dollar. The US currency rose 0.6 per cent to 
$1.8569 against the pound, taking sterling's losses in the past month to 7.8 per cent.
Also helping sentiment was overnight gains on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 
per cent to 11,615.93.
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 rose 0.5 per cent in holiday-thinned trade to 13,019.41 but in Hong Kong the Hang Seng 
index lost 1 per cent in afternoon trading to 21, 181.68 because of losses for commodity companies.

cent to £10.38p.
London lifted as commodity prices fall
One of the biggest factors in the commodity sell off was the rising dollar. The US currency rose 0.6 per cent to 
$1.8569 against the pound, taking sterling's losses in the past month to 7.8 per cent.
By the close of its £400m rights issue Bradford & Bingley shares were trading at 0.25p above the buy back price of 
55p.
Michael Page, the recruitment agency, fell after it announced it was ending discussions and rejecting a £1.3bn 
unsolicited approach from Swiss rival Adecco. The Michael Page board said that Adecco's offer "materially 
undervalued" the company. The shares lost 6 per cent to 315p.
Also helping sentiment was overnight gains on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 
per cent to 11,615.93.
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 rose 0.5 per cent in holiday-thinned trade to 13,019.41 but in Hong Kong the Hang Seng 
index lost 1 per cent in afternoon trading to 21, 181.68 because of losses for commodity companies.

The UK's benchmark index closed lower on Friday as gains made by retail and travel stocks were offset by weaker 
miners.
At the end of play, the FTSE 100 was down 43 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 5,454.8. Whereas the FTSE 250 was 
slightly higher, up 0.7 per cent to 9194.9.
Miners were hit by falling metals prices. Nickel dropped 2.6 per cent on the London Metal Exchange, while copper 
and zinc also fell. Meanwhile gold fell nearly 2 per cent, back below $800 an ounce.
Resource stocks dominated the top 10 list of fallers on the benchmark index. Kazakhmys lost 7 per cent to £11.73. 
Vedanta Resources fell 4.7 per cent to £17.22.
The sell-off in the energy markets also resumed, pushing Nymex crude oil back below $114 a barrel. BG Group 
eased 1.3 per cent to £11.12, and BP fell 2.2 per cent to 515¾p.
But companies with high exposure to fuel costs were better off, and cruise operator Carnival rose 3.6 per cent to 
£19.85, while British Airways, which on Thursday announced plans to join forces with American Airlines and Iberia, 
added 2.9 per cent to 261p. Budget airline Easyjet climbed 3.2 per cent to 366¼p, while larger rival Ryanair jumped 
more than 7.8 per cent to EUR2.85.
Firstgroup, the transport company which has operations in the US, made firm gains  benefiting from lower crude 
prices and the stronger dollar. Its shares were up 4.2 per cent to 581½p.
London weighed down by weaker miners
Retailers rallied following John Lewis' announcement of a 9.3 per cent increase in year on year weekly sales, for 
the week to August 9. Marks & Spencer was up 3.9 per cent to 276p and Next followed with a rise of 2.8 per cent to 
£10.37p. Whitbread the restaurant and hotel owner of brands such as Beefeater and Premier Inn, also rose on the 
back of John Lewis' weekly sales figures. Its shares were up 2.9 per cent to £11.83.
Bradford & Bingley shares remained flat at 54¾p , just below the buyback price of 55p set for its £400m rights 
issue. The mortgage lender will be hoping its offer, which closed on Friday, will attract greater shareholder support 
than the disastrous capital raising of rival HBOS.
Michael Page, the recruitment agency, fell after it announced it was ending discussions and rejecting a £1.3bn 
unsolicited approach from Swiss rival Adecco. The Michael Page board said that Adecco's offer "materially

European shares climbed higher on Friday as a recovery in the greenback boosted companies which rely on the US 
for earnings offsetting weakness in commodities stocks.
In late morning trade, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,196.38, Germany's Xetra Dax added 0.4 per 
cent to 6,569.05 and the CAC 40 in paris was 0.6 per cent higher  at 4,483.19.
Spain's Grupo Ferrovial, which owns British airport operator BAA, flew higher on reports that Irish budget carrier 
Ryanair is mulling a takeover bid for Stanstead airport.
Ferrovial climbed 8.6 per cent to EUR36.99 after Ryanair chairman Michael O'Leary said that British regulators 
would likely break up the British Airport Authority opening the way for bids. Ryanair gained 5.9 per cent to EUR2.69.
Italian eyewear group Luxottica rose 8.3 per cent to EUR17.72 after the shares were briefly suspended for 
excessive gains. The luxury eyewear company, which has strong sales in the US, was boosted by strength in the 
US dollar, traders said. French peer Essilor International rose 4.7 per cent to EUR28.86.
The buoyant greenback also boosted aerospace companies EADS, which climbed 6.1 per cent to EUR14.43 
shrugging off fears that its Airbus subsidiary might face the cancellation of a large order. Aerospace group Safran 
also rose 7.1 per cent to EUR12.15 despite a price target cut from EUR15 to EUR11 from Credit Suisse.

Companies across Europe have begun to cut jobs, scale back production and reduce hiring to slash costs as they 
brace for a recession or sharp economic slowdown at the end of the year.
The defensive moves are being seen in businesses ranging from carmakers and airlines to accountants and banks.
"Our strategy is to freeze the non-essential," said John Griffith Jones, chairman of KPMG in the UK and joint-head 
in Europe. "Non-essential vacancies are not being filled and we're saving on non-essential overheads."
Mr Griffith Jones said KPMG was seeing a "boom" in its restructuring business and was still hiring for strategic 
posts but said he was "a bit of a bear" on the general economy.
Gary McGann, chief executive of Smurfit Kappa, said the Irish packaging group had recently brought in a cost-
cutting programme and had been careful not to add extra capacity after enjoying high prices last year.
"It is fair to say it is the most difficult time we have been through," he said, adding that he predicted a wave of 
bankruptcies and consolidation in his industry. "I think we are heading for recession and it will be deeper than many 
people think."
Carmakers, led by Italy's Fiat and Germany's Mercedes and BMW are cutting production and eliminating shifts at 
factories while airlines such as British Airways and Ryanair are chopping flights. Companies from Siemens and 
Saint-Gobain in the engineering sector to Henkel in consumer goods and the Italian bank UniCredit have recently 
announced plans to cutjobs.
European companies braced for slowdown
All this comes as business confidence plunges in Europe, with the European Commission's sentiment index falling 
to its lowest level in five years.
Second-quarter earnings of European companies are also suffering, although they are down less than some 
analysts predicted. Of those companies that have reported, western European companies are performing worse 
than their US counterparts, according to Bloomberg data.
ING, the Dutch bank, said its latest so-called "surprise ratio" of companies that had performed better than expected 
against those who did worse was minus 19 per cent for the eurozone; minus 9 per cent for the UK and minus 5 per 
cent for the US.
The gloominess is not shared equally, reflecting the country's economic mood. Irish, Spanish and British groups 
have been more downbeat than their German and Benelux counterparts.
But even the relative optimists are watching the situation. Ad Scheepbouwer, chief executive of Dutch 
telecommunications group KPN, said he had yet to see a change in spending in Benelux countries or Germany. But 
he added: "The moment we will see a slowdown in revenue, we would upscale the cost reduction programme that 
we have."
The European economy grew 0.7 per cent in the first three months of the year, stronger than the US. However, 
most economists forecast a slowdown in the second quarter.

European companies are increasingly preparing themselves for a recession or sharp economic slowdown as they 
make a series of defensive moves ahead of tougher times at the end of the year.
Companies from carmakers to accountants are seeking to slash costs by cutting production or jobs, clamping down 
on perks and scaling back on hiring people.

Is the era of cheap air travel ending? This week brought two typically contrasting answers. Willie Walsh, British 
Airways chief executive, insisted on Friday that fares must rise sharply to reflect higher fuel costs. Days before, 
Michael O'Leary, the iconoclastic boss of Ryanair, was placing a very different bet. Air fares were going to fall, he 
said, as he heralded the start of a new price war.
Mr Walsh, reporting an 88 per cent slide in first-quarter profits, said the industry must price $120-$140 a barrel oil 
into the business. In previous downturns, airlines would have quickly cut fares to try to fill more seats. "The old 
argument was that (with a little more passenger traffic) you cover the variable costs and contribute to the fixed 
costs. But that does not apply now." With fuel now making up 40-50 per cent of the industry's total costs, the 
variable cost was too high. So the medicine at BA is save costs where you can, rein in capital expenditure, take part 
in consolidation (the planned merger with Spain's Iberia), but most immediately reduce the number of daily services 
and push up prices as far as you dare on remaining flights. At the same time manage the fleet for maximum fuel 
efficiency and buy new aircraft to replace gas-guzzlers.
Try telling that to Mr O'Leary. While other airlines are forcing prices up, Mr O'Leary has grabbed yet again for the 
price lever to force prices down to fill his ever-growing number of aircraft and seats.
He is in a very different position to his fellow Irishman at BA, where short-haul flying accounts for only 20 per cent of 
capacity. Ryanair is 100 per cent in short-haul. It is the lowest-cost producer in the business. It has lots of cash and 
one of the strongest balance sheets. It also has by far the broadest spread of network and bases and therefore of 
market risk of any airline across Europe.
Mr O'Leary is gambling again that economic weakness will take many of his rivals to the wall or at least force them 
to shrink drastically. He will be there to come out of the downturn with a much bigger market share. In part he is 
It is not yet the end for budget air travel
locked into this strategy because of new aircraft deliveries coming his way, with deposits paid and penalties for 
pulling out. But he has used a similar strategy before to take advantage of other's woes.
"It is good to have someone like Michael O'Leary around," said Mr Walsh. "He scares people to death. And what he 
does and what he says are often very different. But Ryanair is an important competitor, and we treat it with respect. 
If I was in his position, I might well do the same."
For all that he likes sometimes to dress up as St Patrick or the Pope, Mr O'Leary is far from infallible. His gamble on 
not taking out hedging protection as the oil price soared, in the belief that it would soon fall back, has come 
spectacularly unstuck.
But as long as he is the lowest-cost producer, he is likely to be the last man standing. It will be his actions, and 
those of his closest rival, the other big European low-cost carrier, EasyJet, that largely determine whether the era of 
low-fare air travel in Europe still has a way to run.
"The demise of low-fare air travel is again being predicted by high-fare airlines like BA and others who are still 
losing short-haul traffic to Ryanair," Mr O'Leary said this week. "Higher oil prices won't end low-fare air travel, it just 
increases the attraction of Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares. Higher oil prices will speed up the decline of high-fare 
short-haul travel this winter . . . Ryanair will lead this downward pricing at a time when most of our competitors are 
hoping to raise fares and fuel surcharges."
He has been as good as his word. At the beginning of the week he was reporting an 85 per cent fall in underlying 
net profits in his first quarter and forecasting a possible full-year loss. By Wednesday he was offering 1m 
"recession-busting fares inclusive of taxes and charges" across Europe. He followed that with an offer of 300,000 
seats in Germany for EUR3 ($4.68, £2.36) including taxes and charges, challenging a weaker rival, Air Berlin.
Already I hear your objections.  What about all the extra charges - for baggage, check-in, for the use of a credit 
card? And do you really want to fly with Ryanair? The stampede to board the aircraft, the cramped leg room, the 
noise, the non-stop selling.
For many, the answer will be yes. But you have to accept the O'Leary contract. I need to get to the southern 
Scottish Highlands in mid-October. For weeks I have been trying to obtain one of the cut-price deals supposedly 
available to travel by rail on the overnight sleeper. Forget it. They are as elusive as the monster in the loch.
On Friday morning I bought two Ryanair tickets from London Stansted to Glasgow Prestwick for £55.96, a lot less 
than it costs for a tank of diesel for our VW Golf. That was the total price, two people, all in, including all taxes and 
charges and including £16 as the credit card handling fee. Yes of course we will check in online, check in no bags, 
and each have only one carry-on bag weighing less than 10kg. And we will run to the plane. That is the O'Leary 
contract. But throw in the hire car and petrol, the train from Liverpool Street to Stansted (nearly half as much as the 
air fare) and there is still nothing to touch it. The return sleeper for two would have been £378.
Of course fuel prices are a severe threat to the low-cost airline business model in the longer term, but the 
suggestion that the era of low-fare air travel is over - at least in short-haul - is certainly premature.

Ryanair expands presence in Italy

Ryanair, the biggest European low-cost carrier, is expanding its presence in Italy by establishing two more 
operating bases at Bologna and Forli.
The group is continuing to expand its operations aggressively in spite of the pressures it is facing from surging fuel 
costs and weakening economic growth in important markets.
It warned this week that it could fall into loss in the current financial year to March 2009 for the first time since it was 
floated 11 years ago. It is still expanding capacity ambitiously, however, albeit at a slightly slower rate than 
previously planned.
While it is reducing its flying programme at some airports for part of the coming winter season to reduce lossmaking 
operations - chiefly at London Stansted and Dublin, its main European bases - it is increasing its overall capacity in 
the winter by 8-9 per cent following an expansion of 18-19 per cent during the current summer months.
Overall this year Ryanair is raising capacity by about 14 per cent, and in spite of softening consumer confidence it is 
still forecasting a growth in passenger numbers from 51m in the last financial year to 58m in the current year to 
March 2009.
The airline has launched a renewed price war in order to try to stimulate traffic to fill the additional aircraft coming

Ryanair expands presence in Italy
Ryanair will start flying seven routes into Bologna from the end of October. It said it would establish an operating 
base at the airport in June 2010 with two aircraft rising to five by 2012, when it forecasts it will be handling 25 routes 
and 2m passengers through the city.
A smaller base will be established at nearby Forli with one aircraft in March next year. Ryanair already has three 
bases in Italy at Rome Ciampino, Pisa and Milan Bergamo.
The Irish carrier is among a group of the strongest European airlines, including EasyJet, Lufthansa and Air France-
KLM, which are moving fast into the Italian market to take advantage of the woes of Alitalia, the heavily lossmaking 
state-dominated Italian flag carrier, which has been close to bankruptcy for months and has only been kept afloat 
this year through further state aid.

Ryanair, the biggest European low-cost carrier, is expanding its presence in Italy by establishing two more 
operating bases at Bologna and Forli.
The group is continuing to expand its operations aggressively in spite of the pressures it is facing from surging fuel 
costs and weakening economic growth in important markets.
It warned this week that it could fall into loss in the current financial year to March 2009 for the first time since it was 
floated 11 years ago. It is still expanding capacity ambitiously, however, albeit at a slightly slower rate than 
previously planned.
While it is reducing its flying programme at some airports for part of the coming winter season to reduce lossmaking 
operations - chiefly at London Stansted and Dublin, its main European bases - it is increasing its overall capacity in 
the winter by 8-9 per cent following an expansion of 18-19 per cent during the current summer months.
Overall this year Ryanair is raising capacity by about 14 per cent, and in spite of softening consumer confidence it is 
still forecasting a growth in passenger numbers from 51m in the last financial year to 58m in the current year to 
March 2009.

European equities resumed their downward trend on Tuesday as the beleaguered financial sector came under 
renewed pressure after Merrill Lynch in the US took a large third-quarter writedown.
By mid morning, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.2 per cent to 1,145.31, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax shed 1.2 per cent to 
6,274.36, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 1 per cent to 4,282.38 and London's FTSE 100 fell 0.8 per cent to 5,270.5.
In the US overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.1 per cent and the S&P 500 shed 1.9 per cent as the 
banking sector tumbled in response to Merrill's admission that it will write down $5.7bn in the third quarter and 
hoped to raise $8.5bn in an equity issue.
"This will push the financials down on rising concerns of future capital increases," said Saxo Bank, which 
recommended taking short positions on Barclays, UBS, ING, Dexia and Deutsche Bank.
Switzerland's UBS fell 6.3 per cent to SFr19.14, Britain's Barclays lost 7.7 per cent to 313p and Deutsche Bank fell 
3.5 per cent to EUR56.30. Franco-Belgian group Dexia shed 4.1 per cent to EUR8.16 and Dutch financial services 
group ING lost 3.5 per cent to EUR19.83.
Swiss Life, the insurer, fell 8 per cent to SFr260.50 after its dividend agreement took effect. The company said that 
instead of an annual dividend per share, it would reduce the par value in its shares to SFr17 from SFr34, effectively 
returning SFr17 to shareholders.
Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemical company, fell 12 per cent to EUR37.77 after cutting its full-year profit outlook 
following a 3 per cent fall in second-quarter underlying earnings. The company said slowing global growth and 
rising costs of raw materials were responsible for the move.
Financials lead European losses
Domestic rival DSM, however, rose 9.2 per cent to EUR38.99 after its core profit jumped 19 per cent in the second 
quarter, beating market expectations and helping it lift its full-year guidance.
Investors also cheered second-quarter results from German business software maker SAP, which climbed 6 per 
cent to EUR36, after a better-than-expected 21 per cent rise in sales.
Elan, the Irish drugmaker, fell 7 per cent to EUR20.15 as investors nervously awaited details from clinical trials of its 
Alzheimer's disease treatment bapineuzumab later in the day.
There was little relief for airline and travel stocks following Monday's 22 per cent fall for Irish budget carrier Ryanair. 
The company reported a dramatic fall in quarterly profits as fuel bills soared, and signalled it would launch 
aggressive winter promotions to ramp up its load factor.
Andrew Fitchie at Collins Stewart said on Tuesday: "Ryanair's results were a warning shot for the entire sector, and 
a price war is likely to mean pain for all carriers in the short term."
Ryanair's shares fell a further 1.4 per cent to EUR2.47, while Air France-KLM lost 1.1 per cent to EUR15.83 and 
Deutsche Lufthansa lost 2.2 per cent to EUR14.66.

British Airways and Iberia said on Tuesday they were confident of securing regulatory approval for their proposed 
merger.
In recent years Air France and Lufthansa faced few obstacles to their respective takeovers of KLM, the Dutch flag 
carrier, and Swiss International Air Lines.
European competition authorities have been broadly in favour of consolidation in the previously fragmented aviation 
sector, in particular where deals have had few network overlaps.
A notable exception was Ryanair's hostile attempted takeover in 2007 of Aer Lingus, which was blocked last year 
after a detailed Brussels investigation. The European Commission said a combination would lead to a near-
monopoly in the Irish market and harm passengers, a view Ryanair is still contesting fiercely in European courts.
International traffic rights remain a minefield. Concerns about rights torpedoed BA's talks about a takeover of KLM 
in 2000, but Air France and Lufthansa have since shown that the problem can be overcome.
The scale of the challenge has been reduced by the "open skies" treaty between the US and the European Union. 
All national carriers in the EU are now under a common European designation. Iberia therefore would face no 
danger of losing its traffic rights to the US if it were deemed UK-owned.
Other Iberia bilateral traffic rights outside the EU and the US will have to be renegotiated by the Spanish 
government.
European competition rules broadly favour consolidation
BA and Iberia already operate a profit and revenue-sharing joint venture on their UK-Spain trunk routes between 
London and Madrid and Barcelona. That will be important for future scrutiny by the competition regulators.
The joint venture was given antitrust immunity by the European competition authorities in December 2003 and 
began operating in January 2005.

Michael O'Leary is finding it harder to pull new rabbits out of the hat to keep Ryanair in profit, as the global airline 
industry crisis deepens.
The iconoclastic boss of Ryanair faces his first annual loss since taking over as chief executive in January 1994, 
under pressure from record fuel costs and with consumer confidence plunging in key markets led by the UK and 
Ireland.
To date Mr O'Leary has been phenomenally successful. At turns bullying, foul-mouthed, charming and humorous, 
he has transformed the airline industry in Europe, forcing many of his much bigger network rivals to adopt lessons 
from the low-cost business manual.
Along the way he shrugged off the last aviation recession in the early years of the decade, exploiting the woes of 
rival carriers to expand faster.
Now though, he faces what looks like his biggest challenge, with people questioning his failed gamble on the oil 
price weakening and his ability to withstand a severe consumer slowdown. There are growing doubts about the 
budget airline model he pioneered.
Mr O'Leary, true to form, is still coming up with new cost-cutting ploys. In October he will begin to experiment with 
"zero baggage flights". On a trial basis Europe's biggest low-cost carrier will ban check-in bags on a few flights to 
test passenger responses.
It hopes the experiment will help lead to a sharp cut in airport passenger and baggage-handling costs and reduce 
the time needed to turn an aircraft round, as one response to offsetting the hugely damaging surge in fuel costs.
Ryanair chief seeks new ploys to fly clear of trouble
The ban will be accompanied by the  introduction in October of self-service check-in kiosks at its main bases at 
London Stansted and Dublin to reduce airport staff and handling costs further.
Mr O'Leary is also close to launching the long-awaited trial of a service allowing the inflight use of mobile phones 
and BlackBerrys, allowing Ryanair to earn a small commission.
Such innovations, though, pale into insignificance when set against the scale of the challenge posed by the surge in 
oil prices.
The airline's fuel bill increased 93 per cent year-on-year to EUR367m (£290m) as the crude oil price almost doubled 
from $61 to $117 a barrel. Fuel accounted for almost 50 per cent of Ryanair's total operating costs in its first quarter 
from April to June, up from 36 per cent a year earlier and from less than 17 per cent at the beginning of the decade.
Mr O'Leary gambled on the oil price weakening and chose not to hedge in recent months. He lost the bet in 
spectacular fashion and remains more exposed to current fuel prices than most rivals.
Given the magnitude of the task he faces to offset the impact of both soaring fuel costs and plunging consumer 
confidence, Mr O'Leary is resorting chiefly to familiar methods. Yesterday, as so often in the past, he grabbed for 
the ticket price lever to stimulate weakening passenger traffic, believing it to be his strongest weapon against the 
downturn.
Yet again he is launching a price war, gambling that consumers will trade down and that rivals will be forced to cut 
capacity and consolidate or else be forced out of business, ceding market share to Ryanair.
Only eight weeks ago, a more confident Mr O'Leary was forecasting a rise of 5 per cent in fares in the financial year 
to March 2009. Since then economies, in particular in the key Ryanair markets of the UK, Ireland and Spain, have 
weakened perceptibly.
Yesterday he forecast a fall in average fares of 5 per cent for the full year - they fell 8 per cent year-on-year in the 
first quarter from April to June. Such a fall, combined with $130-a-barrel oil, would plunge Ryanair from an 
underlying profit of EUR481m last year to a loss of up to EUR60m this year and at best break-even.
Mr O'Leary adamantly rejected suggestions yesterday that the low-cost airline business model was terminally 
broken.
As consumers became more price sensitive they would switch away from "high fare-fuel surcharging airlines" such 
as British Airways. "Higher oil prices will speed up the decline of high fare short-haul travel this winter as many 
European airlines consolidate or go bust," he said.
"We will respond as always with lower fares and aggressive pricing to keep people flying and maintain our high load 
factors . . . Ryanair will lead this downward pricing at a time when most of our competitors are hoping to raise fares 
and fuel surcharges."
To a large degree, Mr O'Leary is locked into this strategy. He has a stream of new jets being delivered from Boeing 
- the fleet will expand by 32 this year - which must all be filled.
Mr O'Leary is condemned to try to grow his way out of trouble, at a time when growth is incredibly difficult to come 
by.
"The market this winter will be heavily impacted by the timing and scale of European airline bankruptcies and 
consolidations, which are inevitable at these higher oil prices," was his typically defiant conclusion yesterday.
He is supported by one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. But he is relying on others going to the wall 
to ensure his own survival.

Ryanair fell heavily into loss in its first quarter and on Monday warned it could suffer an underlying loss of up to 
EUR60m for the full year under pressure from surging fuel costs and falling airfares.
In late morning trading Ryanair shares were down 13 per cent and triggered further falls across the aviation sector, 
as it warned it could be in loss this year for the first time since it was floated in 1997.
For the three months from April to June Europe's biggest low-cost carrier reported an 85 per cent fall in underlying 
net profits from EUR139m to EUR21m.
The Irish airline has suffered badly by losing its gamble that the oil price would fall back. Without the protection of 
hedging its fuel requirements it has carried the full burden of the rapid increase in fuel costs.
On Monday it said the policy had been reversed and it had begun to hedge again for the early winter.
Despite making a small operating profit in the quarter, it was pushed heavily into loss by exceptional items including 
a second heavy write-down of EUR93.6m on the value of its 29.8 per cent holding in Aer Lingus, the rival Irish 
carrier, and by accelerated depreciation of EUR17.9m on 15 older aircraft it plans to sell in 2009/10.
Including the one-off charges of EUR111.4m it fell to a pre-tax loss of EUR90.5m from a profit of EUR156m in the 
same period a year ago, its worst results for more than a decade.
Ryanair's operating profits from continuing operations fell from EUR157.5m a year ago to EUR25.7m, before 
exceptional items of EUR17.9m, and to EUR7.9m including the charges.
Ryanair heading for full-year loss
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said trading conditions had been "difficult"   under the impact of higher 
fuel prices and timing of the Easter holidays, which were in March rather than in April.
The airline's fuel bill had increased by 93 per cent year-on-year to EUR367m as the crude oil price almost doubled 
from $61 to $117 a barrel. Fuel accounted for almost 50 per cent of its total operating costs, up from 36 per cent a 
year earlier.
Ryanair said its average fare level had also fallen by eight per cent, as it was forced to lower prices to fill seats in its 
growing fleet, as it opened new routes and bases.
It was also hit by a reduction in the share of passengers paying to check in baggage, as more customers chose to 
check in online and to take only carry on baggage.
Ryanair said it had taken advantage of the recent weakness in oil prices and was now 90 per cent hedged for 
September at $129 per barrel and was 80 per cent hedged for its third quarter from October to December at $124 
per barrel. It was still unhedged for the fourth quarter from January to March, 2009.
Mr O'Leary said the group continued to believe oil prices remained "subject to irrational exuberance  . . .  We 
believe that oil prices of approximately $130 per barrel are unsustainable over the medium term, but we don't know 
when they are going to fall."
He said the outlook for the remainder of the financial year to March 2009 was "entirely dependent on fares and fuel 
prices" and remained "poor."
Mr O'Leary said "the emerging economic recession in the UK and Ireland caused by the global credit crisis and high 
oil prices means that consumer confidence is plummeting, and we believe this will have an adverse impact on fares 
for the rest of the year."
Ryanair would "respond as always with lower fares and aggressive pricing" in order to continue filling its seats.
On the basis of its existing fuel hedges, oil prices of around $130 a barrel in the fourth quarter and average fares 
falling by 5 per cent for the full year, Ryanair said it expected an underlying result for the full year of "between 
breakeven and a loss of EUR60m".
The market during the coming winter season would be "heavily impacted" by the timing and scale of airline 
bankruptcies and consolidations in Europe, which were "inevitable at these higher oil prices," said Mr O'Leary.
"When oil prices fall significantly, as we believe they will over the medium term, then our earnings should rebound 
strongly," he said. The group still had one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and continued to be 
"strongly cash generative" with more than EUR2.2bn in cash.
Measures taken by Ryanair to cut its costs include a company wide pay freeze and job cuts at its Dublin call centre. 
It has renegotiated many of its maintenance and handling contracts and is planning to introduce check-in kiosks 
from October at its main bases in Dublin and Stansted to further reduce airport staff and handling costs.
It recently announced capacity reductions for the coming winter at Stansted and Dublin with the grounding of 15 
and four aircraft respectively at the two airports.
Overall capacity would still grow, however, and the airline forecast traffic growth of nine per cent and growth in 
passenger volumes for the full year of 14 per cent to 58m, down from previous guidance for growth of 16 per cent.

Ryanair shares tumbled 23 per cent yesterday after surging fuel costs and falling airfares forced the airline to report 
a heavy first-quarter loss and warn it could fall into the red for the full year for the first time since it was floated 11

Europe's biggest low-cost carrier posted an 85 per cent fall in underlying net profits for its first quarter from April to

Ryanair's share price plunged by 71 cents to EUR2.50, triggering further falls across the aviation sector. EasyJet

Equity markets in Europe were undermined by weak financial stocks on Monday after two Australian banks 
announced credit market-related impairments, while airlines were hit by Ryanair's poor results.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.9 per cent to 1,159.03 - given little incentive to push higher after Wall Street opened

Frankfurt's Xetra Dax lost 1.3 per cent to 6,351.15, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 1.2 per cent to 4,324.45 and London's

The biggest loser on the Eurofirst 300, however, was Dutch logistics company TNT, which fell 7.5 per cent to 
EUR22.18 after reporting a fall in second-quarter operating profit due to weaker European markets.
Airlines were in trouble after Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair fell 22 per cent to EUR2.52 after it reported an 85 per cent 
slump in its first-quarter net profit after its fuel bill nearly doubled from the same period a year ago.
"The high proportion of discretionary travel, combined with a pressure on people's disposable income, makes it 
difficult for Ryanair to pass its cost increases on to the passengers," said Gert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon.
He added: "Given the weak economic conditions, we do not expect earnings to recover strongly in the near term"
Elsewhere in the travel and leisure sector, fellow airlines Lufthansa of Germany, and Air France-KLM were off 3 per 
cent to EUR14.99 and 2.2 per cent to EUR16.00 respectively. German holiday firm Tui lost 2.8 per cent to

slump in its first-quarter net profit after its fuel bill nearly doubled from the same period a year ago.
"The high proportion of discretionary travel, combined with a pressure on people's disposable income, makes it 
difficult for Ryanair to pass its cost increases on to the passengers," said Gert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon.
He added: "Given the weak economic conditions, we do not expect earnings to recover strongly in the near term"
Elsewhere in the travel and leisure sector, fellow airlines Lufthansa of Germany, and Air France-KLM were off 2.4

Banks provided the most downside pressure after ANZ Banking Group and National Australia Bank were hit after

Equity markets in Europe were undermined by weak financial stocks on Monday after two Australian banks 
announced credit market-related impairments, while Citigroup lowered its rating on the European sector.
In mid morning trade, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 stood 0.5 per cent lower at 1,164.3, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax lost 0.8 per 
cent to 6,383.95, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.9 per cent to 4,337.03 and London's FTSE 100 was flat at 5,351.7.
The biggest loser on the Eurofirst 300, however, was Dutch logistics company TNT, which fell 8.4 per cent to 
EUR21.97 after reporting a fall in second-quarter operating profit due to weaker European markets.
Airlines were in trouble after Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair fell 13.4 per cent to EUR2.80 after it reported an 85 per 
cent slump in its first-quarter net profit after its fuel bill nearly doubled from the same period a year ago.
"The high proportion of discretionary travel, combined with a pressure on people's disposable income, makes it 
difficult for Ryanair to pass its cost increases on to the passengers," said Gert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon.
He added: "Given the weak economic conditions, we do not expect earnings to recover strongly in the near term"
Elsewhere in the travel and leisure sector, fellow airlines Lufthansa of Germany, and Air France-KLM were off 1.8 
per cent to EUR15.18 and 1 per cent to EUR16.20 respectively. German holiday firm Tui lost 2.2 per cent to 
EUR15.10.
Banks provided the most downside pressure after ANZ Banking Group and National Australia Bank were hit after 
announcing writedowns. Meanwhile, a downgrade of the sector by Citigroup on Friday was still causing some upset.

Deutsche Postbank lost 3.3 per cent to EUR45.23, while Anglo Irish Bank fell 3 per cent to EUR5.86 and Britain's

London equities fell on Monday, after a bounce for mining stocks failed to fully counteract further weakness in the 
financial sector.
The FTSE 100 closed 40 points lower at 5,312.6, a loss of 0.75 per cent. The FTSE 250 fell 151 points to 8,716.7, a 
1.7 per cent drop.
Banks fell after a poor showing for their peers on Asian markets overnight kept fears about the extent of subprime 
losses in the sector alive.
Barclays lost 5 per cent to 338¾p, Lloyds TSB fell 3.9 per cent to 318¼p and Royal Bank of Scotland fell 4.1 per 
cent to 206¼p. HBOS was 7.3 per cent weaker at 287½p.
Airlines were hit by a warning from Ryanair that it could suffer an underlying loss of up to EUR60m for the full year 
after it reported first quarter numbers, hit by soaring fuel costs and falling fares.
Its shares lost 22.1 per cent to EUR2.52, and led the rest of the sector lower. British Airways was 5 per cent weaker 
at 234½p and EasyJet lost 8 per cent to 308¾p.
Worries about the outlook for consumer spending in the UK also lingered and hit stocks exposed to dwindling 
disposable incomes. Carnival, the cruise operator, fell 4.5 per cent to £17.59, Marks & Spencer lost 3.8 per cent to 
250p and fashion retailer Next lost 3.9 per cent to 994p.  Enterprise Inns was 4.7 per cent lower at 302¾p.
A confident showing for resource stocks, in line with strong commoditiesd markets, was not enough to offset the 
torpor.
Banks lead FTSE losses
Among the miners, Antofagasta climbed 7.1 per cent to 540p, while Vedanta Resources added 5 per cent to 
£18.52. In the energy sector, Tullow Oil gained 2.8 per cent to 747½p, and BG Group rose 1.7 per cent to £11.27.
Well-received interim numbers from Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, helped its shares to the upper end 
of the leaderboard, up 1.8 per cent at 606p.

European financial stocks sank on Tuesday as traders grew increasingly twitchy ahead of earnings reports due this 
week.
The trigger for the sell-off was a warning from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group that full-year profit would 
fall by the biggest amount since 1992 as bad debts mounted.
That knocked confidence in Europe's financial sector, which had rallied more than 16 per cent in the space of 10 
days.
A downgrade of the financial sector by Citigroup on Friday was still causing some upset ahead of results from 
several European banks, including Deutsche Bank and Banco Santander.
DBank was down 2 per cent to EUR58.36 and Santander 1 per cent lower at EUR12.
Irish banks suffered particularly badly. Allied Irish Banks, whose first-half results are due on Wednesday, slipped 
9.8 per cent to EUR7.40 while Anglo Irish Bank slid 12.7 per cent to EUR5.28 and Bank of Ireland lost 10.5 per cent 
to EUR5.01.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.9 per cent to 1,158.86 points and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 1.2 per cent to 4,324.45 
points. Frankfurt's Xetra Dax lost 1.3 per cent to 6,351.15 points, and was not helped by figures showing that 
German consumer confidence had fallen to a five-year low.
European equities weak as financials flop
One of the biggest fallers on the Eurofirst 300 was TNT, Dutch postal company, which lost 7.5 per cent to 
EUR22.18. The express delivery firm suffered a fall in second-quarter operating profit because of weaker demand 
in Europe.
Airlines were in trouble after Irish carrier Ryanair fell 22.1 per cent to EUR2.52 after reporting an 85 per cent fall in 
first-quarter net profit because of surging fuel bills.
Gert Zonneveld, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, believes that earnings are unlikely to bounce back soon.
He said "The high proportion of discretionary travel, combined with a pressure on people's disposable income, 
makes it difficult for Ryanair to pass its cost increases on to the passengers".
The gloom extended to other European carriers.
Air France-KLM retreated 2.2 per cent to EUR16 while Lufthansa fell 3 per cent to EUR14.99. The German airline 
was also hurt as its workers started a strike in Frankfurt and Hamburg.
Ahead of Tuesday's first-half results, Austrian Airlines rose  by up to 31 per cent on speculation of a tie-up with a 
strategic investor, thought to be Lufthansa. The stock later fell back to close up just 3.2 per cent on the day at 
EUR3.58.
Elsewhere in the travel and leisure sector, German holiday firm Tui lost 2.8 per cent to EUR15 and French hotel 
group Accor fell 3.2 per cent to EUR43.86.
On the upside, rallying metals prices on commodity exchanges helped miners and smelters reclaim lost ground.
Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro rose 4.9 per cent to NKr64.40 while steelmaker ArcelorMittal rose 2.4 
per cent to EUR50.97.
Stainless steel maker Outokumpu rose 6 per cent to EUR16.34, making it the biggest blue chip gainer in Helsinki 
after an upgrade from "underperform" to "neutral" by Credit Suisse.
European carmakers took a hit after Toyota Motor Corp cut its 2008 outlook.
The Japanese company lowered its 2008 global sales forecast by 350,000 units to 9.5m vehicles because of 
pronounced weakness in the US market.
In Germany, Daimler fell 1.6 per cent to EUR38.26 and BMW was down 3 per cent to EUR29.75. Renault of France 
lost 3 per cent to EUR55.13. Italy's Fiat fell 5.3 per cent to EUR11.07.
Over the weekend, a Chinese court dismissed a claim by Fiat that  Great Wall Motor, a Chinese carmaker, had 
infringed the patent for Fiat's Panda car.

London equities held steady on Monday, with resurgent mining stocks counteracting further weakness in the 
financial sector.
The FTSE 100 slipped 15 points lower in mid-session trade to 5,337.5, a loss of 0.3 per cent. The FTSE 250 fell 50 
points to 8,818.4, a 0.6 per cent.
Banks drifted lower after a poor showing for their peers on Asian markets overnight kept fears about the extent of

Royal Bank of Scotland fell 1.6 per cent to 211½p. HBOS was 5.2 per cent weaker at 295.3p.
Wider financial stocks also suffered. Schroders, the fund manager, dipped 1.8 per cent to 952p and Man Group, the 
world's biggest-listed hedge fund, was 0.8 per cent weaker at 587p.
Worries about the outlook for consumer spending in the UK also lingered and hit stocks exposed to dwindling

commoditiesd markets. BHP Billiton was 3 per cent higher at £15.99, Xstrata rose 2.6 per cent to £33.56 and Rio

A test of leadership for Caz's compromise candidate

Finance directors often struggle when they make the transition to being a chief executive, so it is a good thing that 
Naguib Kheraj is making the switch armed with a reputation for Teflon self-belief.
The former finance director of Barclays bank, is taking on the unique role of running JPMorgan Cazenove, the City 
stockbroker.
That alone is a responsibility. But the job is complicated by the firm being a joint venture between a US investment 
bank, JPMorgan, and the original Cazenove broking business. The situation is also fluid; both parents have options 
to take full control of the business next year. Moreover, David Mayhew, the chairman and public face of the firm, is 
68 and expected to retire before long. Worse, JPMorgan Cazenove has been without a chief executive since 
February.
On any measure, the firm needs strong leadership right now. And with that in mind, the pool of candidates for the 
job was always going to be small. James Leigh-Pemberton, a top banker at Credit Suisse, has a reputation with 
clients to rival Mr Mayhew's, and the experience of leadership roles at a global investment bank. But he turned the 
job down.
Internal candidates, such as Ian Hannam and Alan Carruthers, were too closely linked to either of the joint venture's 
parents to be acceptable to all parties.
That has created an opportunity for Mr Kheraj to nip in as a compromise candidate. He has been a board director 
and divisional chief executive within Barclays before, with more people under his command than will ever be 
employed by Caz. But this is his first chance to prove himself in a really tricky management job.
A test of leadership for Caz's compromise candidate
He has some advantages - a steely intellect, unflappable composure, many years' experience in large investment 
banks, and the fact that he is an outsider allied to neither camp in the joint venture.
But his manner is an acquired taste and he lacks Mr Mayhew's charisma and reputation as an adviser. He may 
never acquire them. But if so, he needs to demonstrate that his own attributes, while less characterful, are equally 
valuable in leading this firm to its rightful destiny.
Plane stupid
Michael O'Leary warned in June that Ryanair would break even this year only with the benefit of rising airfares, 
such is the crippling impact of high fuel prices. In spite of the mountain of evidence that the consumer is buckling, it 
needed Mr O'Leary to spell out yesterday that fares would not be rising after all for the penny to drop in the City that 
2008 could be a lossmaking year for the Irish airline. As a result, the share price suffered the stock market 
equivalent of rapid descent.
Mr O'Leary is not one to take a crisis lying down and he is taking the battle to the competition by undercutting 
aggressively. If this is to be a low-fares environment, bring it on, is his attitude.
It is a strategy that will make investors queasy. But Mr O'Leary has a strong balance sheet on his side. Moreover, 
he has emerged from economic downturns with increased market share before. It is hard to believe from 
yesterday's share price reaction, but Mr O'Leary is still the most likely candidate to be the last man flying when the 
crisis is over.
All change at Unilever
Patrick Cescau has not been running Unilever long by the standards of other FTSE 100 companies - just three-and-
a-half years. But it is right that the consumer goods group is already planning for him to depart next year.
Investors generally think he has done a good job, and his age - he is 60 next year - ought to be no barrier to staying 
on. But the company is more than half way through executing its existing business plan, and now is the time to be 
thinking of a change of tack. Consumer goods companies, once considered stable, slow-moving businesses, are 
under greater pressure than ever before amid increasing competition from smaller, more entrepreneurial companies 
as well as retailers that make soups and detergents.
Unilever's rivals, aware of the need to stay competitive, have been ringing the changes. Already this year, Paul 
Bulcke has taken over from Peter Brabeck as chief executive of Nestlé, Kasper Rorsted has taken over from Ulrich 
Lehner at Henkel and Muhtar Kent has succeeded Neville Isdell at Coke.
A challenging market makes it tempting to go for an internal candidate on the basis that continuity is important. 
Moreover, the company has already hired a new chairman, Michael Treschow, and chief financial officer externally. 
But Unilever should cast the net widely and be ready to go externally once more as it seeks to find new energy.

Financial stocks led the market lower with Lloyds TSB under pressure after a leading broker suggested its dividend 
was in jeopardy.
Lloyds reports half-year figures on Wednesday and is expected by analysts to announce a maintained interim 
dividend of 11.2p a share. But Cazenove was telling clients on Monday that the dividend was unsustainable and the 
final payment, due next year, would be cut by 40 per cent.
Simon Pilkington, analyst, said: "As the probability of a recession grows, in our view management can only avoid a 
capital issue by cutting the dividend and slowing balance sheet growth.
"We will review our estimates after the results but given the changed economic environment we believe that it will 
become untenable for Lloyds to maintain its dividend."
Lloyds ended the day 3.9 per cent lower at 318¼p.
It was a grim day for the banking sector as investors cut positions ahead of the results from Lloyds and HBOS, 
down 7.3 per cent to 287½p, which reports on Thursday. HBOS was put under pressure by comments from José 
Ignacio Goirigolzarri, chief executive of rumoured bidder BBVA. He said the Spanish bank was focused on organic 
growth and the integration of its US banks.
Elsewhere in the sector, Barclays gave up 5 per cent to 338¾p, while Royal Bank of Scotland slipped 4 per cent to 
206¼p as traders locked in profits. Since hitting a 10-year low on July 15, the FTSE All-Share banking index has 
risen 17 per cent.
Financial fears push London lower
The FTSE 100 finished 40 points, or 0.8 per cent, lower at 5,312.6, pulled down by the financials and a warning 
from Joachim Faber, the head of Allianz Global Investors, that stock markets had the potential to fall by a fifth and 
were likely to reach their lows only in the first half of next year.
The London market would have fallen further had not a strong performance by mining stocks, again in demand as 
the "sell financials/buy commodities trade" was put back on.
Antofagasta led the way for the miners, rising 7.1 per cent to 540p, followed by Vedanta Resources, up 5 per cent 
to £18.52, and Kazakhmys, 4.6 per cent stronger at £13.63.
The FTSE 250 fell 151 points, or 1.7 per cent, to 8,716.7. Trading volumes were pitiful, with just 2bn shares traded, 
against 3.2bn on Friday.
Rexam, the largest manufacturer of drinks cans, was marked 6.6 per cent lower at 352p ahead of Wednesday's 
half-year results.
Last week, US rival Ball Corp warned of the impact of rising rail and freight costs on profits and many traders feel 
Rexam could make similar comments with its results.
Rolls-Royce, down 4 per cent to 355¾p, was out of favour after a profits warning from Ryanair and a UBS "sell" 
note. The broker was concerned more airlines would mothball aircraft and Rolls-Royce could take further provisions 
for customer financing exposures.
A JPMorgan downgrade to "underweight" left Sage, the accountancy software group, off 3.4 per cent at 194.2p. The 
broker told clients: "Sage gets 58 per cent of revenues from the US and UK, the two key areas that are seeing 
economic slowdown".
J Sainsbury bucked the weak market trend, rising 2 per cent to 323½p after the Qatar Investment Authority 
announced a raised holding of 27.2 per cent.
Among the mid-caps, pub companies were hit by a flurry of profit taking. Mitchells & Butlers, which had gained 36 
per cent from its lows on July 16, closed 9.5 per cent lower at 239½p, while Punch Taverns, up by 25 per cent in 
the same period, finished 7.2 per cent weaker at 250p.
Barratt Developments added 6.8 per cent to 105½p on the back of a push from Numis Securities. Chris Millington, 
analyst, setting a 175p target price, said Barratt was trading on the lowest valuation in the sector in spite of being 
more secure with regard to banking facilities and trading far better than many of its peers.
Aegis, the media buying group, was in focus late on as clips of 4.5m shares changed hands. Aegis eased 0.9 per 
cent to 105½p, while Rentokil Initial fell 4.2 per cent to 67¾p as traders reflected on the fact that the group has net 
debt of £1.1bn against a shrunken market value of £1.2bn.

EasyJet profit fears over surge in fuel costs sparks sector slide

EasyJet profits could fall by more than 40 per cent this year because of the surge in fuel costs, the airline said on 
Thursday, triggering a steep fall in share prices across the aviation sector.
EasyJet shares fell 37½p or 10 per cent to 332½p. British Airways fell 8 per cent, Ryanair by about 3 per cent and 
Air France-KLM by 5.3 per cent, largely wiping out the previous day's gains, which had come in response to this 
week's fall in the crude oil price.
In recent days, however, jet kerosene prices have fallen far less than the price of crude oil.
EasyJet forecast pre-tax profits, before one-off items, would fall to £110m-£120m in the current financial year to the 
end of September, from £191m a year ago, based on an average jet fuel price of $1,280 (£643) per tonne in the six 
months from April to September.
Jet fuel is trading at just under $1,300 a tonne. Easy Jet has hedged 28 per cent of its fuel requirements for the next 
financial year to September 2009 at $1,265 a tonne. It expected fuel costs for the year to September 2008 to rise by 
£185m but said it had managed to offset about half of the increase by cutting other costs and raising revenues per 
passenger.
EasyJet, the UK's leading budget airline, also plans to sharply cut its rate of capacity growth during the winter and 
to cut capacity at its London Stansted base. The company will also close its Dortmund base in Germany.
It said the winter season would be "challenging" for the entire airline sector.
EasyJet profit fears over surge in fuel costs sparks sector slide
The EasyJet statement followed recent announcements by Ryanair, its Irish rival, of capacity reductions during the 
winter at its main Stansted and Dublin bases. British Airways is expected to announce plans next week to cut 
capacity in the winter by 3-5 per cent, mainly in short-haul European flights.
EasyJet said that its underlying business continued to "perform well and in line with expectations". Non-fuel costs in 
the second half were also hit, however, by higher airport charges, in particular at London Gatwick, owned by BAA.
The airline is seeking a judicial review of the sharp rise in Gatwick charges, approved earlier this year by the Civil 
Aviation Authority, the economic regulator for the three main London airports. EasyJet is reducing its capacity 
growth this winter to between 4 and 6 per cent from a previous level of about 15 per cent. At Stansted, winter 
capacity will be cut by about 12 per cent as the airline reduces unprofitable flying.
It plans to re-allocate some capacity from poorer-performing bases, such as Dortmund, to stronger airports such as 
Milan Malpensa, Gatwick and Paris Charles de Gaulle. Ryanair said last week it was cutting the number of weekly 
flights to and from Stansted by 14 per cent this winter.
EasyJet said flexibility was vital in a volatile environment.

EasyJet on Thursday warned its pre-tax profits could fall by more than 40 per cent  this year under pressure from 
the surge in fuel costs.
The news sent the shares down more than 8 per cent to 340¼p in lunchtime London trading, losing much of the 9 
per cent gain on Wednesday.
The leading UK low-cost airline disclosed plans to reduce sharply its capacity growth during the coming winter 
season and to cut capacity at its base at London Stansted. It is also planning to close its base at Dortmund in 
Germany.
EasyJet said it would reduce its overall capacity growth to between 4 and 6 per cent from 15 per cent. At Stansted 
capacity in the winter would be cut by about 12 per cent.
The coming winter would be "challenging" for the entire airline sector, it said.
The EasyJet statement follows recent announcements by Ryanair of capacity reductions during the winter at its 
main Stansted and Dublin bases. British Airways is expected to announce next week plans to cut capacity in the 
winter by 3 to 5 per cent, mainly in its short-haul European network.
Based on an average jet fuel price of $1,280 a tonne in the six months from April to September, EasyJet forecast 
pre-tax profits before one-off items would fall to £110m-£120m in the year to the end of September. This compares 
with £191m a year ago.
EasyJet shares fall as fuel costs surge
Jet fuel is currently trading at just over $1,300 a tonne. EasyJet said it had hedged 28 per cent of its fuel 
requirements for the financial year to September 2009 at $1,265 a tonne.
The airline said it expected its fuel costs for the current year to rise by £185m, although it had managed to offset 
about 50 per cent of the increase by cutting costs and raising revenues per passenger.
However, it said its underlying business continued to "perform well and in line with expectations".
In the third quarter to June the airline said its passenger volumes had increased by 16 per cent to 11.5m, while 
capacity, measured by the number of available seats, rose by 18 per cent. The period includes the first time 
inclusion of GB Airways, the Gatwick-based carrier taken over from the end of January.
However, non-fuel costs in the second half of the financial year had been under pressure from higher airport 
charges, in particular at London Gatwick, owned by BAA.
EasyJet is seeking a judicial review of the sharp rise in charges at Gatwick, which was approved earlier this year by 
the Civil Aviation Authority, the economic regulator for the three leading London airports.
The group's results have been supported by a 12 per cent rise in total revenues per seat in the three months. 
Ancillary revenues per seat almost doubled with a rise of 93 per cent year-on-year driven chiefly by the introduction 
last October of a charge for checked in bags, which was increased to £5 a bag at the end of March.
Revenues have also been strengthened by the weakness of the pound against the euro. Total revenues in the 
quarter rose by 32 per cent from £487m to £641m.

Pints of beer, Marks and Spencer's ready meals and flights to continental Europe are among the things that 
consumers are cutting back on as they tighten household budgets.
On Tuesday, the latest mobile phone joined a growing list of products that the British consumer is learning to live 
without. Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone operator, said that the number of customers coming through its 
doors was slowing in the UK as shoppers choose to put up with old handsets rather than splashing out on new 
models.
The glum news prompted the biggest ever one-day slide in Vodafone's share price. But at least Vittorio Colao, 
incoming chief executive, is not suffering alone. A raft of consumer-facing companies have delivered woeful trading 
updates over the past couple of months as the credit crunch has spilled out of the City and into high streets.
The early part of the year was mixed, but May and June were, by most accounts, awful. July is not shaping up any 
better.
M&S set economic alarm bells ringing in early July, when the high street bellwether issued a shock profits warning 
and told investors Britain was facing its most severe consumer downturn since the 1990s. The shares fell by a 
quarter on the news and dragged down the rest of the retail sector.
A dearth of customers with money to spend on new cars has also prompted profits warnings from the UK's biggest 
car lot retailers, Pendragon and Lookers, while electricals and homewares businesses are also struggling to hit big-
ticket sales.
Tales of woe as consumers tighten belts
And with consumer confidence figures from May indicating a low not seen since 1990, the contagion is spreading 
inexorably beyond the high street.
Others feeling the bite include Trinity Mirror, the newspaper group, which issued a profits warning on the back of 
falling advertising sales.
Taylor Wimpey, Britain's biggest housebuilder, ran into trouble this month after failing to secure new financing from 
shareholders in a £500m cash call.
In the airline sector, Ryanair plans to ground 20 jets, about a tenth of its fleet, over winter in response to tougher 
times and the soaring price of fuel. And British Airways is "up to its neck in perhaps the biggest crisis the aviation 
industry has ever known", according to Martin Broughton, chairman.
And it appears consumers are not even reacting to the pressures on their purses by drowning their sorrows, at least 
not in their local ale houses. Enterprise Inns, operator of more than 7,000 British pubs, said yesterday that beer 
sales were falling sharply.

Spanair, Spain's second largest airline, is to cut about a quarter of its workforce and its fleet in an attempt to combat 
high fuel prices, fierce competition and a sharp downturn in its domestic market.
The loss-making carrier, which is owned by the Scandinavian group SAS, said on Wednesday it would shed 900 
staff jobs as part of a "viability plan". The announcement comes a month after SAS abandoned a year-long search 
for a buyer for its Spanish subsidiary, which last year incurred an operating loss, before one-off items, of about 
EUR30m.
The planned disposal was part of a cost-cutting campaign that included the divestment of SAS's stakes in BMI 
British Midland and Air Greenland. In spite of interest from a range of suitors, including the Spanish flag carrier 
Iberia, SAS was unhappy with the offers for Spanair.
The Spanish subsidiary said it would also cut its fleet by 15 aircraft - from a total of 63 - during September and 
October. It also plans to drop nine routes, including Mad­rid to Vienna and Barcelona to Zurich, as well as loss-
making domestic services.
Spanair said it hoped to cut EUR90m ($143m) from its cost base in 2009. It said this was aimed at "stopping the 
losses, which have been aggravated by the unprecedented high cost of fuel".
Company executives are also concerned about passenger demand in Spain, which they see falling by about 3 per 
cent this year, and as much as 7 per cent in 2009.
Spain's weakening economy, coupled with high oil prices and competition from the low-cost carriers Ryanair and 
EasyJet, is forcing a shake-up in the market, amid broader global upheaval in the industry.
Spanair cuts jobs to retain 'viability'
Vueling and Clickair, two low-cost Spanish carriers, last week announced plans for a merger.
The International Air Transport Association last month forecast the civil aviation industry would plummet from a 
collective net profit of $5.6bn last year to a loss of $6.1bn.

Thomas Cook ditches Air Berlin deal

Thomas Cook hinted on Friday that it might be lining up an alternative buyer for its Condor charter airline, after 
announcing it had dropped plans to sell it to Air Berlin, Germany's second biggest airline.
Both companies issued statements saying their September 2007 contract for the Condor acquisition through a 
share swap had been cancelled by mutual agreement.
Thomas Cook added it was suspending its share buy-back programme because it was pursuing other options for 
Condor, which it described as material.
The UK-listed tour operator also said it was pursuing other options with Air Berlin, which competes with Ryanair and 
Easyjet in the low-cost market.
Shares in Thomas Cook fell 1.9 per cent to 187p in early London trading. The shares tumbled 40 per cent from a 
2008 high of 318p, recorded in February, on concerns over the impact of the economic downturn on consumer 
spending.
Air Berlin said that in a letter to the German Federal Cartel Office informing it of their decision, both parties cited 
"the significantly changed economic framework conditions" since September - including a doubling of the price of jet 
fuel - as the main reason for pulling the proposed deal.
Condor, a 35-plane fleet whose seats were partly sold on the open market, would have cost Air Berlin around 
EUR500m. It made EUR65m in pre-tax earnings and has EUR350m of debt.
Thomas Cook ditches Air Berlin deal
The proposed deal envisaged Thomas Cook retaining a stake of up to 29.9 per cent and the merger creating 
Europe's fifth biggest airline, providing its owners with EUR70m in synergies.
The terms of the cash and shares deal envisaged Air Berlin paying around EUR120m in cash, but with its share 
price plummeting from around EUR13 a share to EUR3.70 it was faced with having to stump up nearly three times 
as much cash to complete the deal.
It is also integrating its recent purchases of German charter carrier LTU and DBA, the German division of British 
Airways.
Thomas Cook, which also has charter airlines in Scandinavia, Belgium, Canada  and the UK, viewed the deal as a 
way of consolidating the airline market and securing seat supply for its tour operators.
Analysts at Blue Oar Securities said that while not unexpected, the overall effect of the cancelled deal was to 
reduce Thomas Cook's financial liquidity. "As well as the reduction in credit the company will now not receive the 
cash sum promised under the terms of the deal," they said in a note to clients.
"Any move to bolster Condor/airline capacity and keep more planes on the balance sheet would be in contradiction 
of the company's asset-light strategy," they added.

Iberia, the Spanish flag carrier, is to lead the long-awaited restructuring of the country's  loss-making low-cost airline 
sector, as part of the rationalisation of European aviation.
The group, which launched its own low-cost operation Clickair in October 2006, aims to merge the business with 
Vueling, a struggling rival low-cost airline which began flying in July 2004.
Vueling and Clickair suffered big losses last year in the face of fierce competition and surging fuel costs.
Both Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading European low cost airlines, have moved aggressively into the Spanish 
market, which has been  further destabilised by SAS Scandinavian Airlines's failed attempt to dispose of its Spanair 
subsidiary.
Iberia, which currently holds 80 per cent of the economic interests in Clickair and 20 per cent of the voting rights, is 
expected to become the dominant shareholder in the merged carrier, which will operate under the Vueling brand.
Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding agreed by Clickair and Vueling shareholders, the two low-cost 
carriers, which are both based in Barcelona, would be merged with Iberia holding a stake of around 45 per cent.
The deal will only go ahead, however, if Iberia succeeds in obtaining an exemption under Spanish takeover law 
from its obligation to launch a full bid for Vueling, as it would exceed the 30 per cent threshold at which a full bid 
normally becomes mandatory.
People in the group say Iberia would not proceed with the deal if it were forced to launch a full bid.
Iberia looks to lead Spanish airline shake-up
Under the terms of the planned deal, Inversiones Hemisferio, the investment group of the Lara family, which has a 
controlling minority stake of 28.6 per cent in Vueling and which has struggled for months to find a rescuer, would 
hold 15 per cent in the merged carrier.
Nefinsa, the investment group of the Valencia-based Serratosa family - which owns Air Nostrum, a Spanish regional 
airline allied to Iberia - would hold a stake of 5 per cent. It currently holds a 20 per cent stake in Clickair.
Vueling would remain a publicly quoted company with a free float of 30-35 per cent.
Vueling, which launched an initial public offering in 2006, carried 6.2m passengers last year but suffered a net loss 
of EUR63.2m. It has its main bases in Barcelona, Madrid, Paris and Seville. It had a fleet of 24 Airbus A320 aircraft 
at the end of last year and  1,280 staff.
Privately-held Clickair carried 4.5m passengers last year, when it suffered losses of close to EUR50m. It has a fleet 
of 23 A320s and bases at Barcelona, Seville, Bilbao and Valencia.
If the deal goes ahead, Alex Cruz, Clickair chief executive, is expected to lead the merged group, while Josep Pique 
í Camps, chairman of Vueling and a former Spanish foreign minister, would be non-executive chairman.
Lehman Brothers is financial adviser to Vueling. Lazard is acting for Clickair.

Air Berlin in Condor rethink

Air Berlin's aim to become a major European player hit further trouble on Tuesday when the German low-cost 
carrier signalled its planned purchase of German charter airline Condor from travel group Thomas Cook was in 
trouble.
Joachim Hunold, Air Berlin chief executive, told shareholders at the annual meeting that "considerable delays" in 
approval from German authorities and "the changing economic environment" had led to a review of the deal.
Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Thomas Cook chief executive, told the Financial Times the UK group was "discussing the 
future of the deal" and stressed that Condor was "performing well" and the parent company was "not under 
pressure to sell".
Both executives said they were disappointed the German cartel office was still weighing the deal eight months after 
it was announced. But people close to the deal said economic motives had a crucial role in the rethink.
The move came days after the Berlin-based group launched cost cuts - including reducing routes, the phase-out of 
14 of 134 planes, and a 10 per cent reduction in seats on offer - to make up for the drag of record oil prices. The 
programme saw four of 12 Airbus 330 aircraft taken off long-haul routes - markets Mr Hunold had praised for their 
potential when Air Berlin added them with the purchase of another German charter airline, LTU, in 2007.
It was the bolstering of long-haul routes that Mr Hunold stressed when he sealed a deal with the UK's Thomas 
Cook in late September to take over Condor for a cash component and no more than a 29.9 per cent stake in Air 
Berlin.
Air Berlin in Condor rethink
The deal was Mr Hunold's third in the space of a year. Condor, LTU and German carrier DBA were meant to lift Air 
Berlin's passenger volume close to that of the UK's EasyJet, number two after low-cost leader Ryanair.
People familiar with the Condor deal said buyer and seller had fixed its value at EUR500m ($779m, £395m), with 
Thomas Cook slated to extract EUR120m in cash from Condor and receive the difference in Air Berlin stock in 
February 2009.
At the time it was considering the move, Air Berlin's shares had just reached an all-time high of EUR20 and people 
familiar with the deal said it expected a solid share price to persist so it could finance the deal solely with stock.
But rising oil prices and problems integrating LTU have since pushed Air Berlin's shares below EUR5. This price 
values the one-third maximum stake pledged to Thomas Cook at EUR95m, leaving EUR300m yet to be financed.
After Air Berlin saw operating profit slump to EUR21.4m on revenues of EUR2.5bn last year, Mr Hunold on Tuesday 
warned shareholders meeting at Stansted in the UK that this year would also see "a difficult operating 
environment".

Ireland is wrong to put its miracle at risk

After a week of what European leaders call reflection, another Irish referendum beckons, to be held early next year. 
Without it, there might well be an attempt to oust the Irish from the European Union.
A Yes vote in a second referendum is not certain, even if the Irish government were to succeed in securing another 
rent-extracting, treaty-amending protocol. At a time when the Irish economy is about to fall off a cliff, enthusiasm for 
the EU and its treaties will not increase. In other words, holding a referendum would be as risky as not holding a 
referendum. A fine mess.
So within a couple of weeks, the chances of Ireland ending up outside the EU have turned from zero to a distinct 
possibility. The same goes for the Czech Republic, another potential non-ratifier. I do not want to get into the legal 
details of how a country's departure from the EU could be accomplished. Suffice it to say that it can be done within 
European law as long as there is political will.
What strikes me the most about this extraordinary turn of events is the perception in Ireland that a break with the 
EU would be no big deal. I received a large number of letters from Ireland last week from readers who steadfastly 
maintain that the country's economic success had nothing to do with the EU and everything to do with domestic 
policy - in particular with low corporate taxes and skilled labour.
The view expressed by those correspondents is as wrong as it is revealing. If so many people are delusional about 
their country's economy, then we should perhaps not be surprised about the outcome of the referendum. It is 
therefore perhaps worth looking in some detail at the nature of Ireland's economic success over the last 30 years to 
gauge what life might be like outside the EU.
Ireland is wrong to put its miracle at risk
There are several interactive factors. The importance of EU subsidies is almost certainly overrated. They played 
some part, especially in the early phase of the country's economic renaissance. In any case, Ireland is on the verge 
of becoming a net contributor to the EU budget. But one would be even more  mistaken to conclude the opposite: 
that the EU matters nothing or little.
Ireland was one of the early and enthusiastic members of the European Monetary System in 1979, which brought 
much needed macroeconomic stability. Membership of the eurozone in 1999 led to lower interest rates, which have 
contributed to the economic growth ever since. Low corporate tax rates certainly helped Ireland attract foreign 
investors. But never forget that Ireland is also the only English-speaking member of the eurozone, the one place 
where eurozone and Anglosphere meet.
The country naturally benefited from membership of the EU's internal market. Without it, Ryanair, the Irish low-cost 
airline, would not be able to offer its popular flights across Europe. The Irish have also proved influential in the 
management of the internal market, not least through Charlie McCreevy, the Irish commissioner in charge of the 
EU's internal market and financial services. As a member of the EU, Ireland has been in a position to veto motions 
that would have impaired the country's economic success. Without steadfast opposition from Ireland, the EU would 
have made more headway in imposing corporate tax harmonisation.
I do not want to play down the importance of domestic policies either. Ireland owes its success to a complex set of 
policies and circumstances. Perhaps among the most important were the various tripartite social partnership 
agreements since 1987, through which the government, employers and the trade unions achieved a combination of 
wage moderation, high employment and low taxes. This form of round-table corporatism works best in tiny open 
economies if it works at all. It is ironic that this country, whose officials take pleasure in hectoring others on free-
market economics, is in fact one of Europe's most corporatist states. Even France and Germany cannot produce so 
much social partnership, and I can assure you that this is not for lack of trying.
So what would happen if Ireland were to leave the EU? As an associate member of the single European market, 
Ireland would probably attract less foreign investment than it does today. Dublin's financial centre would be 
demonised as an offshore tax haven and treated on par with Liechtenstein. We would see lots of Ryanair flights 
between Dublin and Cork and the EU would put even more pressure on Ireland to raise corporate taxes.
Oh, and by the way, Ireland would no longer be a member of the eurozone. The Irish could use the euro if they 
wanted to but this would be like Panama using the dollar - a little sad, really. There would be no Irish voice in the 
European Central Bank's governing council warning that this is not a good time to raise interest rates. Leaving the 
EU involves a huge loss power and influence.
To put it mildly, the No vote is highly risky. Considering that the country is now on the verge of a severe economic 
slowdown, brought on by a downturn in the real estate market and the credit market crisis, it could not have come at 
a worse time. Not only does the No vote carry risks, it is a highly asymmetric gamble that brings no material benefit 
under the best of circumstances. The No vote put Europe's most impressive economic miracle at stake, and the 
cards are not looking good.

Carnival, the world's biggest cruise operator, has become the latest company to issue a profits warning as a result 
of the surging oil price.
The Miami-based company, which operates the Cunard and Princess cruise lines, said full-year earnings were 
expected to be between $2.70 and $2.80 a share, compared with its previous guidance of $3.00 to $3.20 a share.
The warning came in spite of efforts by the group to counter higher fuel costs by increasing ticket prices.
Micky Arison, chief executive, said: "The impact of skyrocketing fuel prices on our operating results has 
overshadowed the revenue yield improvement we have experienced."
Oil prices have roughly doubled over the past year.
A number of airlines, including EasyJet and Ryanair, have warned in recent months that the run-up in fuel prices 
could lead to a sharp decline in their profits this year.
Mr Arison said second-quarter results were better than forecast due to solid cost controls.
"Our North American and European brands continue to perform well in the current difficult economic environment 
and we were pleased with our second-quarter results.
"Despite the current difficult economic environment, our booking trends continue to be solid," he said.
However, higher fuel prices cost the company $158m (£80m), or 19 cents a share, during the quarter. The company 
said it was expecting this year's fuel cost to be $752m higher compared with 2007.
Carnival downgrades earnings guidance
Net profit for the second quarter was $390m, or 49 cents a share, compared with $390m, or 48 cents a share, in the 
same period a year ago.
Analysts had on average expected quarterly earnings of about 42 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
Quarterly revenue was $3.4bn compared with $2.9bn in the same period a year ago.
The stock has fallen by more than 30 per cent over the past year.

Aer Lingus, the Irish carrier, has been forced by record fuel costs to rein in ambitious growth plans prepared for its 
long-haul network.
It is cutting long-haul capacity sharply in the coming winter season and is highly dependent on gaining all of its 2008 
profits during the three summer months.
It is suspending one of its key routes to the US west coast from November and has forecast it will fall into loss this 
year at current fuel prices. It is also joining the increasing number of airlines to defer some new aircraft deliveries, 
as it seeks to slow its planned capacity growth.
The airline says it is sticking to its medium-term long-haul growth strategy, developed two years ago as part of the 
group's initial public offering in October 2006. It planned to double its fleet of long-haul aircraft from seven to 14 by 
2014.
Aer Lingus has become more cautious about its plans for 2009, however, as the global airline industry braces itself 
for mounting losses and weakening demand for air travel in the face of surging fuel costs and the resulting rise in 
fares as airlines seek to pass on part of the higher fuel bills to passengers.
The Irish carrier, in which local rival Ryanair holds a hostile stake of 29.3 per cent, is in effect cutting its long-haul 
capacity by 15 per cent in the coming winter season, including the suspension of its longest route between Dublin 
and Los Angeles.
Enda Corneille, Aer Lingus's corporate affairs director, said in an interview with the Financial Times: "LA is the 
longest sector and is being hit disproportionately at the current price of oil."
Aer Lingus reduces capacity
However, it would maintain its new San Francisco route, which was opened last October along with two other new 
routes to Washington Dulles and Orlando, as it moved to take early advantage of the US-European "open skies" 
treaty.
Aer Lingus says for the moment it has no plans to suspend any further long-haul routes from either Dublin or 
Shannon on the west coast of Ireland, but Mr Corneille said, "the Shannon winter long-haul schedule is a real 
struggle".
Any move to reduce its long-haul presence in Shannon would provoke a political uproar, however, following the 
turmoil triggered last summer when Aer Lingus announced it was ending its services between Shannon and London 
Heathrow in favour of using the Heathrow slots to launch London services from its new base in Belfast.
Aer Lingus had originally - with a current fleet of nine long-haul Airbus A330 jets - planned to take delivery of three 
new A330s in 2009 and to retire one older plane, leaving a fleet of 11.
Mr Corneille said the plan was now to maintain the fleet at nine next year. A second older plane would be retired 
and one of the new deliveries from Airbus would be deferred to 2010.
During the winter season three of the existing long-haul fleet will be taken out of service to be refurbished to 
common cabin standards, with the new deliveries leading to the overall cut of 15 per cent in winter capacity.
John Sharman, Aer Lingus chairman, told investors two weeks ago that, based on current fuel prices and given the 
uncertain economic outlook, the airline expected "at best to break even" in 2008.
NCB Stockbrokers forecast that, based on a crude oil price of $125 a barrel, Aer Lingus would fall from an operating 
profit of EUR88.5m last year to an operating loss of EUR4.6m (£3.6m) this year and a deeper loss of EUR47.1m in 
2009.
Offsetting the rising fuel bill, Aer Lingus is seeking to cut other costs. Reform of working practices is expected to 
yield savings on labour costs of EUR20m this year, while recent radical changes to the airline's maintenance 
contracts are also expected to lead to savings of EUR20m in 2009.
The group is also hoping for increased long-haul revenues - its routes are exclusively to the US - from its decision 
to open a code-sharing partnership with United Airlines from November and to drop its long-standing arrangement 
with American Airlines. It is also developing a marketing alliance with JetBlue.

THE PROBLEM
Record oil prices are causing havoc in energy-intensive industries. United Airlines last week announced it would 
slash more than a fifth of its aircraft fleet and cut 55,000 jobs. Carmakers face falling sales of gas-guzzling sport-
utility vehicles and pick-up trucks; General Motors last week announced plans to close four SUV and truck plants in 
the US, Canada and Mexico. Other sectors in pain include steelmakers, hauliers and logistics groups. Managers in 
fuel-hungry businesses face a tough decision: whether to respond immediately with a transformed business model, 
or to ride out the period in hope of an eventual easing in prices and the prospect of increased market share when 
the worst is over. How to decide?
THE ADVICE
THE PRJim CunninghamWhile the impact of high oil prices on companies is serious, their effects on electricity 
prices could pose an even greater problem for mature economies. First, oil prices usually influence the price of the 
other fuels traditionally used to generate power, such as natural gas and coal. Second, in many competitive power 
auctions, the price of the most expensive "last in bid" sets the price for all electricity suppliers. Third, most 
productivity-enhancing or clean technologies of the past 20 years depend on a reliable and reasonably priced 
source of electricity. To assure the continued development of these technologies, business leaders around the 
world must demand energy policies that are honest, achievable and actually have an effect. We must reduce our 
dependence on oil and use what we need more efficiently. Electric cars or hydrogen-powered electric hybrids can 
add to the efficiency gains produced by the most advanced electricity grids and further reduce our dependence on 
oil. This alone could cut our usage by up to 50 per cent. Clean coal technologies and nuclear power should also be 
used to meet the growing electricity needs of the medical, financial and communications industries.The writer is a 
managing director at Burson-Marsteller
Will oil prices force managers to tear up the business model?
THE EXECUTIVEMichel DemaréWith energy costs continuing to increase exponentially, the case for efficiency is 
stronger than ever. Many industries, including heavy manufacturing, can realise substantial benefits. Industrial 
motors, for example, consume about one-third of all the electricity produced today. Yet the vast majority run at full 
speed all the time, regardless of actual requirements. Applying motor control technology can cut energy use (and 
cost) by as much as 70 per cent. In fact, the purchase price of a motor, regardless of size, is generally exceeded by 
the energy cost of running it within a year.  In the long run, energy efficiency improvements make sense; in the near 
term, soaring fuel prices give added urgency to that rationale. Whether managers opt for a wholesale reworking of 
business plans or hold the line with the current strategic model, the energy cost crisis makes the logic of efficiency 
measures impossible to resist. The writer is CEO and CFO of ABB Ltd
THE ACCOUNTANTRupert MersonWe still need to travel and deliver, so until the world changes its model, there 
will still be business for steelmakers and car manufacturers. And as long as people like me have four kids, there will 
be a need for big cars too. So the problem is not one of opportunity, and a strategy that was good last year should 
still have legs. However, when times turn bad and growth slows, wounds that lay unnoticed when times were good 
start to fester. A critical eye to cost management will identify many indulgences from which you can release yourself 
if you have the guts. High-energy cash control is even more important. Businesses go bust not because they make 
losses but because they run out of cash. So if your model is sound, do not change it, but make sure it is well oiled, 
and clean it thoroughly. And remember that turnover is vanity, profit sanity - and cashflow the only reality.The writer 
is a partner at BDO Stoy Hayward
THE CONSULTANTDean WhiteAny company, regardless of its energy intensity, would be wise to re-evaluate its 
business model, given today's reality of $130 oil prices. That means looking to energy efficiency measures, bringing 
forward capital expenditure on more efficient production processes, and exploring more radical options such as fuel 
substitution or even shutting lines of business. It also means looking at the impact on customers and the 
implications for demand. The task is most urgent for energy-intensive industries. Even in the airline industry, 
though, there are exceptions. Southwest Airlines continues to maintain profitability partly because it has hedged its 
fuel at the oil equivalent of $57 a barrel. For others less fortunate the focus needs to be on managing the double 
blow of an economic slowdown and fuel cost pressures. The solution has to be to boost load factors, through 
reducing capacity, while also adjusting prices. In fuel price terra incognita, the alternative - a wait-and-see approach 
- could prove disastrous. The writer is head of emerging markets at PA Consulting Group
THE ACADEMICNoel TichyLeaders have one job - to add value to the assets they manage by making good 
judgments. When times are tough, the decisions are tougher. The run-up in oil prices presents leaders with some 
dilemmas: hunker down, or transform, or do both. Winning leaders do both - win today while simultaneously 
transforming for tomorrow's world. Southwest Airlines, for instance, is showing good judgment: out-performing 
competitors in the current oil crisis because of a wise judgment to hedge oil. But that will not be enough in the long 
run: it also needs to make longer term strategic choices for success in the upcoming world markets. This process 
has three phases: 1) prepare for the strategic judgment - frame the environment of the future and the organisation's 
strategic alternatives, mobilise and align key stakeholders around a strategic direction; 2) make the strategic 
judgment call and 3) execute the judgment, making adjustments as the future unfolds. Merely hunkering down is not 
an option but a recipe for demise.The writer is professor of management and organisations at the Ross School of 
Business at the University of Michigan and co-author with Warren Bennis of "Judgment: How Winning Leaders 
Make Great Calls"

This is one I have been avoiding but I cannot let the opportunity pass. Ireland's No to the Lisbon treaty provides the 
perfect excuse to give you my 10 greatest Irish people, viewed from an FT perspective. Given its tortured history, 
every choice is potentially loaded.
As in previous lists, those who qualify were born there and have made their mark on politics, business or 
economics. I cannot take the easy way out by choosing St Patrick, born near Carlisle. No writers or musicians 
either. And I have ignored the north-south border.
1. Charles Stewart Parnell (politician, born Avondale, Co Wicklow). Protestant landowner who set 19th-century 
Ireland on course towards land reform and home rule. Were it not for his divorce and early death, could 
independence have come earlier and with less bloodshed?
2. Michael Collins (revolutionary leader, born Clonakilty, Co Cork). Created the Irish Free State in 1922 by 
agreement with Britain, at the cost of civil war in Ireland.
3. Edward Carson (Ulster Unionist leader, born Dublin). Secured exemption from home rule for Northern Ireland but 
warned Unionist leaders not to alienate northern Catholics.
4. Charles Haughey (prime minister, born Castlebar, Co Mayo). Here for one reason alone: in his third term (1987-
1992) he finally adopted the tax and spending cuts that set Ireland on track to become the Celtic tiger.
5. Jack Lynch (prime minister, born Cork). Led Ireland into the European Economic Community in 1973 - one of the 
best things ever to happen to the country, in spite of last week's vote.
Cheer up, here are the great Irish
6. Mary Robinson (former president, born Ballina, Co Mayo). Human rights champion who revitalised the 
presidency.
7. Michael O'Leary (businessman, born near Mullingar, Co Westmeath). Built Ryanair into Europe's largest low-cost 
airline.
8. Arthur Guinness (brewer, born Celbridge, Co Kildare). Founded the Guinness business.
9. Tony O'Reilly (billionaire, born Dublin). Head of a media empire and former chief executive of HJ Heinz.
10. Seán Quinn (entrepreneur, born Derrylin, Co Fermanagh). Ireland's richest man; his cement-to-financial 
services empire spans the border.
The eagle-eyed will note that I have excluded Éamon de Valera, leader of the independence struggle, three-times 
prime minister and later president. He was a hugely significant figure but under his guidance Ireland turned into a 
backward theocracy with a stagnant economy.
Miracle of Howden
I was once a reporter on the Howdenshire Gazette, in what is now David Davis's constituency. That was 30 years 
ago, so I have no insight now into what the electors of Haltemprice and Howden think of the former shadow home 
secretary's quixotic bid for re-election. Howden is a historic market town with a number of royal connections. King 
John, who signed Magna Carta - the document Mr Davis says he is upholding, protecting liberty against central 
authority - once spent Christmas there while still a prince. (Michael Gove, shadow schools secretary, pointed out 
last week that not everyone accepts Magna Carta as holy writ; some denounce the barons who forced it on the king 
as "just another group of self-interested magnates".)
In the Middle Ages, Howden became a centre for pilgrims attracted by the alleged miracle of John of Howden, said 
to have raised his arms from his open coffin during his requiem mass to greet his host. Some of Mr Davis's 
colleagues think he has a similar view of his own powers.
In the 19th century Howden had a famous horse fair. In the 20th century it had an airship station where the author 
Neville Shute worked alongside Barnes Wallis, inventor of the bouncing bomb. Shute made himself unpopular by 
describing the local girls in his autobiography as "brutish and uncouth, filthy in appearance and in habits".
Haltemprice, which comprises the western suburbs of Hull, was of course the constituency of Alan B'Stard, the Tory 
MP played by Rik Mayall in The New Statesman. He twice fought elections in which his opponents were absent, 
which he had arranged by means of a coalmine "accident" and a car crash.
New balls please
What a multi-talented world. After Bob Dylan's paintings, here come those of Martina Navratilova, on show this 
month at Wimbledon and a London gallery. Many are done by whacking paint-laden tennis balls against canvas. A 
new Renaissance?

"As we see an increased risk of earnings revisions and given the a sector's premium rating, we fear the reaction to 
even small revisions will be severe," the brokerage said.
Unilever fell 2.9 per cent to £15.17, in Switzerland Nestle was down 0.9 per cent to SFr496.50, while France's

EasyJet to close a German base

EasyJet is expected to close its operating base at Dortmund in Germany later this year, the first time either the UK 
low-cost carrier or Ryanair, its Irish rival, has closed part of their extensive network of European bases.
The UK airline said Thursday it had begun a 90-day consultation with its pilots and cabin crew in Dortmund about 
restructuring the base, including the option of closure and serving Dortmund routes from other bases.
The expected withdrawal from Dortmund comes only three years after the airport was established as EasyJet's 
second base in Germany - after Berlin-Schönefeld - and follows its failure to meet the group's financial targets.
It is a further sign of the way the surge in fuel costs is tightening the squeeze on airlines' least- profitable operations 
forcing many carriers to reduce capacity and ground aircraft. Ryanair warned recently that it was planning to ground 
about 20 aircraft or 10 per cent of its fleet during the coming winter season.
EasyJet said its problems in reaching an acceptable level of profitability in Dortmund had been exacerbated by the 
early 10pm night-time curfew on operations, which had eroded its competitiveness.
The German airport had the most stringent operating hours of any of its crew bases, which had hampered its ability 
fully to utilise its aircraft. It had failed in repeated efforts to extend the operating hours.
EasyJet had already reduced the number of aircraft located in Dortmund from four to three last summer and the 
airline said the base was too small "in the context of today's oil price" to provide the economies of scale and 
crewing efficiency needed to support a low-cost operation.
EasyJet to close a German base
It said in spite of substantial marketing investment in Dortmund, it had not been possible to offset its cost 
disadvantages, which had been exacerbated by the recent increase in the price of oil.
EasyJet currently operates 11 routes to and from Dortmund and this is expected to be halved in the coming winter 
season.
The UK airline said it was pleased with the progress of its Berlin base, but in Dortmund it had suffered from tough 
competition from the large number of neighbouring airports including Cologne-Bonn, the main base of 
Germanwings, the rival German low-cost carrier, and Düsseldorf.
EasyJet currently has a network of 20 bases including 11 in the UK and nine in continental Europe.
Its biggest base is London Gatwick with 35 aircraft, where it has expanded quickly this year through the takeover of 
GB Airways.

European shares fell for a fifth successive day as investors took profits on metals, mining and oil stocks, while 
banks recovered some lost ground.
Philippe Gijsels, senior equities strategist at Fortis Global Markets, said: "There is room for a 10-15 per cent 
downward correction in commodities stocks and we are advising investors to take some money off the table.
"Governments are increasingly concerned about inflation so there will be moves to combat speculation in 
commodities such as increasing margins".
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,271.24 points, dipping to its lowest level in 10 weeks, and taking the 
fall from its May high to 8 per cent.
The decline in oil and gas stocks was triggered by a drop in the price of crude, which fell below $134 a barrel. 
Investors used the fall in the oil price, which recovered later, as a signal to take profits.
France's Total fell 1.3 per cent to EUR53.99, Norway's StatoilHydro  lost 1.5 per cent to NKr193.20, Italy's Eni was

Oilfield services companies fell in tandem with producers. Italy's Saipem lost 4.1 per cent to EUR28.26 while 
France's Technip shed 2.8 per cent to EUR59.24.
The falling oil price was good news for airlines, which rose after two days of losses. Irish budget carrier Ryanair was 
up 3.6 per cent to EUR3.00, Deutsche Lufthansa added 0.5 per cent to EUR15.71 and Air France-KLM gained 1.6

leaderboard. UBS rose 2.9 per cent to SFr24.50 while Swedbank gained 0.8 per cent to SKr134.50.
French banks were boosted by the European Central Bank's move to inject an extra EUR191bn in seven-day funds 
into the interbank market. BNP Paribas rose 1.3 per cent to EUR60.80; Société Générale gained 0.2 per cent to

In Spain, construction companies were big losers after the government said the slowdown in the building sector was 
more severe than expected.
Sacyr Vallehermoso lost 4.9 per cent to EUR21.19, while Grupo Ferrovial was off 2.6 per cent at EUR44.98. ACS, 
Spain's biggest construction group, was down 3.2 per cent to EUR34.60.
Spanish toll road operator Cintra, in which Ferrovial owns a 68 per cent stake, sagged in line with construction 
companies, dropping 5.3 per cent to EUR8.83. Lift-maker Zardoya Otis also retreated, losing 4.2 per cent to 
EUR16.67.
In France, Veolia Environnement fell 6.5 per cent to EUR42.85 after a downgrade from Oddo Securities that cut its 
recommendation on the stock from "buy" to "add" and slashed its price target from EUR60 to EUR50.
The stock has underperformed its peers this year and would continue to suffer from "poor momentum", the 
brokerage said.

European equity markets were lower on Monday, but oil majors and the companies that support them helped cap 
losses from the financial sector.
In late morning trade, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was down 0.4 per cent to 1,279.48, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax shed 0.1 
per cent to 6,793.94 and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.1 per cent to 4,790.84.
Early indications from US futures trading pointed to opening gains on Wall Street later. This also helped improve 
sentiment sentiment, following Friday's 3 per cent decline on the S&P 500.
StatoilHydro, the Norwegian oil group, climbed 2.5 per cent to NKr200, helped also by the government's 
announcement that it was to increase its stake in the state's biggest revenue earner.
France's Total rose 1.2 per cent to EUR54.25, Italy's Eni added 1.4 per cent to EUR25.56 and Royal Dutch Shell 
gained 1.9 per cent to EUR26.84.
Oilfield services groups also rose in response to near-record oil prices. Italy's Saipem gained 2.2 per cent to 
EUR29.33.
Merrill Lynch advised its clients to "buy" French utility merger partners Suez and Gaz de France, saying the 
combined group would create "one of the most interesting asset portfolios in the sector".
The broker set a price target of EUR46.40 on GdF, sending the shares 3.3 per cent higher to EUR44.41, and 
started Suez at EUR50.90, helping it gain 2.7 per cent to EUR47.99.
Banks drag on European equities
Banks were under pressure after reports that Swiss wealth manager UBS could make a loss of SFr4bn in the 
second quarter. Meanwhile, rumours surrounding US investment bank Lehman Brothers continued to suggest it too 
was facing huge second-quarter losses and the prospect of a multi-billion dollar rights issue.
UBS shares lost 3.4 per cent to SFr23.78, while Deutsche Bank fell 1.9 per cent to EUR62.90 and Commerzbank 
shed 1.7 per cent to EUR19.56.
Record oil prices continued to weigh on the region's airline stocks. Ryanair fell 5 per cent to EUR2.87, while 
Lufthansa lost 1.9 per cent to EUR15.67 and Air France-KLM lost 2 per cent to EUR16.05.

European equity markets fell for a fourth consecutive day on Monday, hamstrung by fears of more losses in the 
banking sector and the rising oil price.
At the close, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was down 0.3 per cent to 1,279.62, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax rose 0.2 per cent to 
6,816.00 and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.1 per cent to 4,798.72.
Banks were also under pressure after reports that Swiss wealth manager UBS could make a loss of SFr4bn in the 
second quarter. Meanwhile, US investment bank Lehman Brothers said it planned to raise $6bn through a stock 
issuance after second-quarter losses of $2.8bn due to the credit crunch.
UBS shares lost 3.3 per cent to SFr23.82, while Belgo-Dutch Fortis fell 4.2 per cent to EUR14.37 and Swedbank 
lost 3.8 per cent to SKr133.50.
Shares in Spain's Banco Popular swam against the tide rising 0.6 per cent to EUR9.5 after a report in Spanish 
newspaper Negocios that Indian investor Ran Bhavnani expects clearance from the Bank of Spain to raise his stake 
from 5 to 10 per cent.
StatoilHydro, the Norwegian oil group, climbed 0.9 per cent to NKr196.20, helped also by the government's

France's Total rose 2.1 per cent to EUR54.72, Italy's Eni added 2 per cent to EUR25.71 and Royal Dutch Shell

Lufthansa lost 2.1 per cent to EUR15.63 and Air France-KLM lost 1.7 per cent to EUR16.09.
Negative broker comment drove truck makers lower, with Germany' s MAN falling 4.1 per cent to EUR86.78 and 
Volvo sliding 3.2 per cent to SKr89.50 after UBS cut the stocks from "neutral" to "sell" saying the sector had peaked 
in 2008 and earnings were sent to slow in 2009.

European equity markets forged ahead on Friday after an overnight spike in oil prices gave a boost to energy 
stocks.

Commodity markets got a lift from a weaker dollar, which helped the benchmark US oil price reach $128 a barrel.

European equity markets shuddered sharply lower on Friday afternoon after US unemployment rose and oil climbed 
back above $130 a barrel.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell from positive territory deep into the red after data showed US employment last month 
rose at its fastest rate in 22 years. It closed 1.9 per cent down at 1,285.02 points, a seven-week low. Frankfurt's 
Xetra Dax lost 2 per cent to 6,803.81 and the CAC 40 in Paris dropped 2.3 per cent to 4,795.32.
On Wall Street the the S&P 500 was 1.7 per cent down and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2 per cent lower.
Commodity markets got a lift from a weaker dollar, which helped the benchmark US oil price roar to $134 a barrel, 
just beneath its record high. Norway's StatoilHydro rose 4.4 per cent to NKr194.50, while Royal Dutch Shell's 
Amsterdam-listed shares gained 0.8 per cent to EUR26.33.
Oilfield services groups also benefited. Norway's Seadrill rose 1.6 per cent to NKr161 and France's Technip added 
1.6 per cent to EUR60.25.
Heavy users of fuel, however, were trampled. Ryanair fell 7 per cent to EUR3, Air France-KLM lost 6 per cent to 
EUR16.37 and Lufthansa lost 4.5 per cent to EUR15.97.
Anglo Irish Bank fell 4.6 per cent to EUR7.50 after Citigroup downgraded the Irish lender to "sell" on concerns over 
its commercial real estate-focused business model. The broker also cut its rating on Bank of Ireland which is also 
"highly exposed" to commercial property and residential mortgages. Bank of Ireland shares were down 4 per cent at

The budget airline market has for some time resembled something of a street brawl. So if Ryanair is to suffer a 
bloody nose in the coming year - chief executive Michael O'Leary only expects to break even with oil prices at $130 
per barrel - it may be time to start worrying what the other guys will look like.
We have heard dire predictions for a painful shake-out of the budget sector pass unfulfilled before, from Mr O'Leary 
himself back in 2004. There were failures, but their places were quickly taken by other start-ups. Yet this time 
round, with aircraft financing conditions much tougher, widespread pain looks inevitable. On Monday the industry 
body, IATA, cut its forecast for airline earnings this year from a profit of $4.5bn to a loss of $2.3bn, based on the 
average oil price so far this year of $105. The US airlines bear the brunt of this, but every $1 rise in the average 
price of oil will cost the industry a further $1.6bn. Capacity has to come out, and even Ryanair plans to ground a 
tenth of its fleet for four months when demand sags in the winter - more than twice as many as last year. Small 
carriers that are yet to make a profit seem unlikely to survive.
However predictions for the death of the low-cost model - made most recently by British Airways chief executive 
William Walsh - look premature. Business cost-cutting, consumers trading down from long-haul to short-haul trips, 
and greater consumer sensitivity to fares, should help support demand for the cheapest tickets. Rising fuel 
surcharges at flag carriers also provide cover to raise budget ticket prices - Ryanair expects prices to be up by 5 per 
cent this summer.
New routes and cheap tickets will continue to stimulate passenger growth. With the most efficient cost structure of 
any European airline, only a small chunk of net debt, and cash reserves on hand, the Irish operator can ride out the 
downturn. It remains the least bad choice in a terrible industry.

European retailers led the continent's bourses higher as broker comments sparked a broad-based recovery in the 
sector.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.8 per cent to 1,329.07 points, shrugging off Monday's losses. Shares got a further 
boost from unexpectedly positive US factory data, which eased fears of a US recession.
French grocery retailers Carrefour and Casino Guichard received a shot in the arm from ING.
The broker initiated coverage of both stocks, with a "buy" recommendation and a EUR57 price target on Carrefour 
and a "hold" rating together with a price target of EUR86 on Casino.
ING said the pair would benefit from their exposure to high-growth markets. Carrefour rose 3.1 per cent to 
EUR45.38 and Casino added 1.1 per cent to EUR82.07.
Supermarket gains lit a fire under the whole sector with French group PPR up 2.9 per cent to EUR85.40, Spain's 
Inditex rising 4.1 per cent to EUR32.23 and Sweden'sHennes & Mauritz up 1.2 per cent to SKr330.50.
European banks remained under pressure. Irish lenders were the latest to feel the effects of nervous European 
markets after the battering received by British banks on Monday when Bradford & Bingley warned on profit and 
lowered the price its rights issue.
Bank of Ireland fell 8.2 per cent to EUR7.48, Anglo Irish Bank shed 7.9 per cent to EUR7.73 and Allied Irish Banks 
lost 2.5 per cent to EUR12.58. All three were playing catch-up with Monday's losses in the sector after Ireland's 
bourse was closed for a public holiday.
Retailers lead European shares higher
UBS, the Swiss bank and one of Europe's worst casualties of the credit crunch, rose 3.8 per cent to SFr25.20, 
supported by comments from ratings agency Standard & Poor's.
"We expect UBS to return to profitability in the remainder of 2008, notwithstanding the potential for further 
writedowns," said S&P analyst Richard Barnes.
In Ireland, no-frills airline group Ryanair climbed 5.4 per cent to EUR2.85 after a better than expected 20 per cent 
rise in full-year net profit.
It warned that it expected to only break even in the current year if crude oil prices stayed near $130 a barrel.
Nevertheless, Numis raised its rating on the stock. Analyst Wyn Ellis said: "We believe sentiment for airline stocks 
will bottom in the autumn and, after recent share price weakness, our recommendation moves to 'hold' from 
'reduce'."
Citigroup was even more upbeat. "We expect many of Ryanair's competitors to fail or scale back at current oil 
prices, making Ryanair an eventual winner from industry upheaval."
Shares in Italian internet provider Tiscali were up 10.1 per cent to EUR2.58 after reports that Vodafone, of the UK, 
was to make an offer for its Italian and UK assets. The mobile phone group was reported to be offering about 
EUR2.80 a share, valuing Tiscali at EUR1.6bn.
German potash maker K&S raised its full-year profit forecast for the second time in three weeks thanks to soaring 
fertiliser prices and tight supplies of potash.
Its shares rose 3.6 per cent to EUR316.16 after the company said pre-tax profit was now expected to hit EUR1.1bn.
On May 14, K&S reported a doubling in quarterly profit and forecast its annual earnings would nearly triple to 
EUR850m.
In the German company's wake, Norwegian fertiliser company Yara International rose 5.3 per cent to NKr407.50.
Shares in Belgian brewer InBev hit an 18-month low on continued concern that a potential takeover of Anheuser-
Busch could be costly. InBev shares fell 2.4 per cent to EUR45.8.

Banks remained under pressure on Tuesday, leaving European equity markets flat, after rumours of a fresh cash 
call in the sector.
By midday, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was unchanged at 1,319.15, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax fell 0.4 per cent to 6,981.53, 
but the CAC 40 in Paris edged 0.2 per cent higher to 4,944.01 and London's FTSE 100 rose 0.1 per cent to 
6,012.3.
Overnight in New York, reports that Lehman Brothers was poised to reveal its first quarterly loss since going public 
and was set to raise up to $4bn by issuing common stock sent Wall Street lower. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average ended 1.1 per cent lower.
Irish lenders were the latest to feel the effects of nervous European markets following the battering received by 
British banks on Monday after Bradford & Bingley warned on profits and repriced its rights issue.
Bank of Ireland fell 7.2 per cent to EUR7.56, Anglo Irish Bank shed 7.4 per cent to EUR7.78 and Allied Irish Banks 
lost 3.4 per cent to EUR12.46. All three were playing catch-up with Monday's losses in the sector after Ireland's 
bourse was closed for a public holiday.
British banks, however, made up for some of Monday's falls as Royal Bank of Scotland rallied 5 per cent on talk of 
stakebuilding by The Children's Investment Fund, the activist fund.
Meanwhile, UBS, the Swiss bank and one of Europe's worst casualties of the credit crunch, rose 4 per cent to 
SFr25.26, supported by comments from ratings agency Standard & Poor's.

Shares in Italian internet provider Tiscali were up 10.1 per cent to EUR2.58 after reports that Britain's Vodafone 
was to make an offer for its Italian and UK assets. The mobile phone group was reported to be offering about 
EUR2.80 a share, valuing Tiscali at EUR1.6bn.
German potash maker K&S raised its full-year profit forecast for the second time in three weeks thanks to soaring 
fertiliser prices and tight supplies of potash.
The shares jumped 3.6 per cent to EUR316.16 after the company said pre-tax earnings were now expected to hit 
EUR1.1bn. On May 14, K&S reported a doubling in quarterly profits and forecast its annual earnings would nearly 
triple to EUR850m. In the German company's wake, Norwegian fertiliser company Yara International rose 4 per 
cent to NKr403.

Banks remained under pressure on Tuesday, leaving European equity markets lower, after rumours of a fresh cash 
call in the sector.
In early trade, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was 0.2 per cent lower at 1,316.94, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax fell 0.5 per cent to 
6,972.17, but the CAC 40 in Paris edged 0.1 per cent higher to 4,949.8 and London's FTSE 100 remained flat at 
6,024.0.
Overnight in New York, reports that Lehman Brothers was poised to reveal its first quarterly loss since going public 
and was set to raise up to $4bn by issuing common stock sent Wall Street lower. The S&P 500 ended 1.1 per cent 
lower.
Irish lenders were the latest to feel the effects of nervous European markets following the battering received by 
British banks on Monday after Bradford & Bingley warned on profits and repriced its rights issue.
Bank of Ireland fell 9 per cent to EUR7.39, Anglo Irish Banks shed 8.3 per cent to EUR7.70 and Allied Irish Banks 
lost 4.2 per cent to EUR12.36. All three were playing catch-up with Monday's losses in the sector after Ireland's 
bourse was closed for a public holiday.
British banks, however, made up for some of Monday's falls as Royal Bank of Scotland rallied nearly 6 per cent on 
talk of stakebuilding by The Children's Investment Fund, the activist fund.
Back in Ireland, no-frills airline group Ryanair climbed 4.4 per cent to EUR2.82 after a better-than-expected 20 per 
cent rise in full-year net profit. The company warned that if crude oil prices stayed near $130 a barrel it only 
expected to break even in the current year.
Caution on banks leads bourses lower
Nevertheless, Numis raised its rating on the stock. Analyst Wyn Ellis said: "We believe sentiment for airline stocks 
will bottom in the Autumn, and after recent share price weakness our recommendation moves to 'hold' from 
'reduce'."
French grocery retailers Carrefour and Casino Guichard received a boost from ING. The broker initiated coverage 
of both stocks, with a "buy" recommendation and a EUR57 price target on Carrefour, and a "hold" rating together 
with a price target of EUR86 on Casino.
ING said the pair would benefit from their exposure to high-growth markets. Carrefour rose 2.3 per cent to EUR45 
and Casino added 0.5 per cent to EUR81.61.

Airline websites are falling in popularity, the latest evidence that more customers are pursuing cheaper holiday 
alternatives at home this summer rather than travelling abroad.
British Airways, Easyjet and Ryanair saw their positions among the top 20 retail websites fall in April against the 
same month last year in a league table compiled by IMRG and Hitwise, the internet monitoring organisations that 
rank companies on site visits. Expedia and Lastminute.com travel sites also tumbled.
"I think the travel industry has been declining over the last year or so," said Robin Goad, director of research at 
Hitwise. However, he pointed out that the falls could have been exaggerated by established retailers moving quickly 
up the rankings.
Amazon led the list, which compares retailers' internet site visits over the last two years, followed by Apple, 
Play.com, Tesco.com and Argos. Easyjet fell from 8th place to 10th, Ryanair from 9th to 14th and British Airways 
from 10th to 19th.
The gloomy news for the travel sector contrasts with a positive picture for overall online shopping revealed in 
another report on Monday, with  Verdict Research, the retail analysis company, finding that online spending grew 
last year at its fastest rate for six years.
The finding - which is based on consumer research - will stoke hopes that internet-focused retailers or bricks-and-
mortar chains with a good online operation can avoid the worst of the incipient downturn.
Verdict found that online retail spending rose 35 per cent to £14.7bn last year, with a 5.9 per cent increase in 
internet users to 33.1m and a 24.7 per cent rise in internet shoppers to 22.6m.
Airlines lose web customers
Malcolm Pinkerton, analyst at Verdict, said cheaper broadband, generational shifts and better websites meant "the 
channel will find itself extremely well-placed to capitalise on the falling consumer confidence and lower levels of 
disposable income currently impacting the retail market".
That phenomenon has lured online some previously sceptical traditional retailers such as River Island, making its 
debut at 34 in the IMRG/Hitwise table, and caused Marks and Spencer and Next to broaden the range of products 
offered online in a successful attempt to capture different areas of retail spending.

Service levels at London Heathrow, Europe's busiest and most congested airport, were a "national 
embarrassment," Giovanni Bisignani, director general of the global airline trade association, said on Monday.
Iata gave the "worst regulator award" at its annual meeting in Istanbul to the UK Civil Aviation Authority as the 
economic regulator for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, the three London airports owned by BAA, a subsidiary of 
Ferrovial of Spain.
Mr Bisignani said the CAA had allowed charges at Heathrow to be increased by 50 per cent during the last five 
years and had recently approved increases by 86 per cent during the coming five years.
Such rises could only happen in "Monopoly-Land," he said.
The airline industry was "in crisis" and it was time "for governments to get serious. Effective regulation means 
delivering results in cost efficiency and good service, not a licence to print money and abuse monopoly powers," 
said Mr Bisignani.
The assault on the CAA by the chief of Iata follows increasingly vitriolic criticism by the leading airlines operating at 
the three airports including repeated calls by Ryanair, the leading European low cost airline, for the replacement of 
Harry Bush as CAA group director for economic regulation.
The airlines have also been urging the break-up of the BAA London airports monopoly, which is currently being 
investigated by the Competition Commission. The UK government has also launched a review of the role of airport 
economic regulation.

3.7 per cent to EUR16.69 and Irish budget carrier Ryanair gained 3.7 per cent to EUR2.83.
Alternative energy stocks, which have also taken a battering in recent days, recovered lost ground with Norway's

Vestas Wind up 4.8 per cent to DKr652 adding to previous gaines.
French telecoms giant Alcatel-Lucent was up 3.3 per cent to EUR4.88 ahead of a shareholder meeting at lunchtime 
which is expected to focus on the performance related payoff being negotiated for CEO Pat Russo amid speculation 
she will step down.
Alcatel shares have dropped over 60 per cent since the spring of 2006 before the ill-fated merger between France's 
Alcatel and US Lucent which sparked a string of profit warnings.
At the other end of the market, oil stocks and miners which led the previous day's rally lagged with Austria's OMV

A dip in oil prices boosted airline stocks and gave a lift to European bourses as investors shifted funds out of 
commodities stocks and into the wider market.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,334.39, bringing its gains over the week to 0.9 per cent. Relief from 
surging energy prices in the last two days of the week gave a fillip to other battered sectors.
"We are very close to a correction in commodities stocks," said Philippe Gijsels, senior equities strategist at Fortis 
Global Markets.
Commodities prices are set to climb over the long term, but a softening of oil stocks that make up a large portion of 
baskets of commodities shares could spark a broad-based sell-off and take the shine off metals and other 
commodities.
Airline shares flew higher with Deutsche Lufthansa up 7.5 per cent to EUR16.67, Air France-KLM adding 3.2 per 
cent to EUR17.19 while Irish budget carrier Ryanair gained 3.4 per cent to EUR2.72.
Tech stocks received a shot in the arm from upgrades and benefited from positive sentiment triggered by the 
decline in oil prices.
Capgemini was the week's biggest gainer, surging 12.4 per cent to EUR43.60 after Cazenove upgraded the IT 
services group to "in line" from "underperform", citing its "more positive view of the European IT services market".
Airlines give Europe equities a lift
SAP was another technology heavyweight buoyed by broker comment, rising 7 per cent to EUR35.52. 
STMicroelectronics, Europe's largest semiconductor maker, rose 4.2 per cent to EUR8.37 after Dell said PC 
shipments jumped 22 per cent.
French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent jumped 9 per cent to EUR4.86. This came as a shareholder 
meeting was convened to focus on the performance-related pay-off being negotiated for chief executive Pat Russo, 
amid speculation that she will step down.
Alcatel shares have dropped more than 60 per cent since spring 2006 - before the ill-fated merger of France's 
Alcatel and US-based Lucent ushered in a string of profit warnings.
At the other end of the market, oil stocks weakened. Austria's OMV fell 4.5 per cent to EUR52.92, Portugal's Galp 
Energia slid 5.8 per cent to EUR16.21 while Norway's StatoilHydro declined 5.9 per cent to EUR198.
French oilfield services company Technip fell 0.5 per cent to EUR60.27 and Norwegian Seadrill shed 4.6 per cent to 
EUR166.50. The Italian Saipem swam against the tide, rising 1 per cent to EUR29.52.
French bank Crédit Agricole tumbled 7.2 per cent to EUR17.01 on talk that it would sell new shares to fund a 
EUR5.9bn rights issue in coming days.
Across the border, German main carrier Deutsche Post dived 6.8 per cent to EUR20.45 after it joined forces with 
arch rival United Parcel Services in a $2bn rescue package for its lossmaking US unit, DHL.

Mining and energy stocks powered a rally in European shares on Thursday, pushing indexes into their second 
consecutive day of gains.
In late-morning trade, the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,334.78, clawing back most of the 
losses from a three-day slide earlier this week after Rio Tinto lit a fire under mining stocks.
"The global economy has been surprisingly resilient despite the credit crunch and so the mining sector is also 
resilient. Growth in the US has stagnated but Europe has not gone the down the plughole and emerging economies 
are strong," said Mike Lenhoff at Brewin Dolphin.
In Germany, the Xetra Dax rose 0.3 per cent to 7,054.34, while in France the CAC 40 was up 0.4 per cent 4,988.24 
and the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.7 per cent to 6,109.9.
Oil and energy shares were the strongest gainers in Europe with Total rising 1.5 per cent to EUR56.42, and 
Portugal's Galp Energia up 2.6 per cent to EUR16.50 as crude oil futures hovered near $130 a barrel.
The strength in oil stocks was bad news for airline stocks sending Ireland's Ryanair sliding 3.7 per cent to EUR2.72 
and Air France-KLM down 2.2 per cent to EUR16.46.
Mining stocks were also sought, with Rio Tinto up 2.1 per cent after it predicted seven years of near-double-digit 
annual production growth, arguing its case for rejecting a $178 billion takeover bid as too low.
Energy stocks power European rally
After a buoyant performance by chipmakers on Wednesday, Germany's Infineon shed 9.4 per cent to EUR5.66 
after it warned of a bigger operating loss and flat sales at its communication chips unit this quarter due to lower 
volumes than expected in some wireless platforms.
Deutsche Post extended its fall, dropping 1.2 per cent to EUR20.18 after a slew of downgrades.
"The news from the US Express business was disappointing concerning the underlying losses expected in 2008 
and the run rate going forward," Unicredit's Christian Obst said.
Unicredit cut the German mail operator's price target from EUR25.70 to EUR24.50 and JPMorgan cuts its price 
target from EUR29.30 to EUR27.

The rally in European stocks on Thursday stuttered after US growth data hit early sentiment in US futures, but the 
markets still finished higher on strong mining and energy moves.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged up 0.3 per cent to 1,330.28, short of early gains, but building on 
Wednesday's climb, which had reversed a three-day slide.
Oil and energy shares were among the strongest gainers in Europe, with Total rising 1.5 per cent to EUR56.45, and 
Portugal's Galp Energia up 2.4 per cent to EUR16.47, as crude oil futures hovered near $130 a barrel.
Utility companies also put in a strong showing on hopes that they could pass on higher energy costs to consumers. 
Germany's Eon rose 2.8 per cent to EUR136.39 after UBS raised its price target from EUR130 to EUR190. 
Domestic peer RWE rose 2.7 per cent to EUR83.76 on talk that Warren Buffett, Blackstone and Permira were 
mulling joining forces to bid for the German utility.
Norway's Renewable Energy plunged 8.1 per cent to NKr142.75 after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the 
stock from "neutral" to "sell" leading the whole renewable sector lower, brokers said.
Swedish telecoms operator TeliaSonera jumped 3.4 per cent to SKr54 on talk that France Telecom was shopping 
around banks for loans to fund a bid. TeliaSonera had lost ground Wednesday after France Telecom said it had not 
opened bid talks with the Swedish company.
The strength in oil prices was bad news for airlines. Irish budget carrier Ryanair slid 3.5 per cent to EUR2.73 and 
Air France-KLM fell 3.8 per cent to EUR16.20, while Deutsche Lufthansa fell 0.8 per cent to EUR16.10.

Mining and minerals stocks were also stronger after Rio Tinto predicted seven years of near-double-digit annual

In Germany, potash maker K&S climbed 3.4 per cent to EUR307 after positive broker comment. Germany's WestLB

After a buoyant performance by chipmakers on Wednesday, Germany's Infineon tumbled 10 per cent to EUR5.62 
after it warned of a bigger operating loss and flat sales at its communication chips unit this quarter due to lower 
volumes than expected. But Holland's ASML extended its gains, rising 1.4 per cent to EUR19.05.
Deutsche Post continued its fall, dropping 1.4 per cent to EUR20.13 after a slew of downgrades following news of a 
$2bn rescue package for its US unit DHL.

Unicredit cut the German mail operator's price target from EUR25.70 to EUR24.50 and JPMorgan cuts its price

French bank Crédit Agricole dropped 3.8 per cent to EUR17.16 after a report in La Tribune newspaper that the 
bank would launch its previously announced EUR5.9bn rights issue next week. Crédit Agricole shares have fallen 
almost 20 per cent since the bank unveiled its plans this month.
Other banks slid in Agricole's wake, with Dexia down 2.4 per cent to EUR14.95 and Société Générale falling 1.3 per

Airport regulator urges BAA breakup

The future breakup of BAA moved a step closer on Friday, as the airports economic regulator said the group's 
common ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted was harmful to competition.
Harry Bush, group director of economic regulation at the Civil Aviation Authority,  said it was "timely to ask whether 
greater competition would better serve consumers".
The CAA, the economic regulator for the three main London airports, added its weight to the growing calls for 
increased competition in the airports sector, backing the recent highly critical interim report from the Competition 
Commission on the structure of BAA.
The CAA said it agreed with the commission that the common ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted by 
BAA was "likely to prevent, restrict and/or distort competition".
It said evidence from UK regional airports, and from the non-regulated London airports, showed airports could 
compete for airlines and passengers and that such competition could deliver significant benefits to consumers.
The CAA said it had not identified any significant benefits that had arisen from BAA's common ownership of the 
airports.
It said it was "important to consider the appropriate 'remedy' to the adverse effects" of the common ownership. 
Remedies could include the divestment of airports.
The Competition Commission said last month BAA's ownership of seven airports in the south-east of England and 
Scotland adversely affected competition.
Airport regulator urges BAA breakup
The CAA's latest evidence will be considered by the commission ahead of the publication of its provisional findings 
in August, including possible remedies such as requiring the sale of one or more of BAA's airports.
The commission investigation is a further serious challenge to the owners of BAA, a consortium led by Ferrovial, the 
Spanish construction, infrastructure and services group, which acquired the airports operator less than two years 
ago. Ferrovial is already struggling to refinance more than £11bn of BAA debt following the highly leveraged 
takeover.
The CAA's own economic regulation of the three London airports has also come under heavy attack from leading 
airlines and Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier and the biggest airline operating at Stansted, again called on Friday 
for the replacement of Mr Bush.

European airlines and other fuel-guzzling industries were savaged this week as the oil price surged to a new high 
and investors switched into energy stocks and defensive heavyweights.
In a week that saw oil storm to a record $135 a barrel, several European airlines warned that rising costs and 
slowing demand would hit profits hard.
Air France-KLM forecast that its operating profit would fall 30 per cent this year, while Finnair said it was bracing for 
a fall in passenger numbers because of the global economic slowdown. Air France-KLM fell 17.7 per cent to 
EUR16.66 and Finnair lost 16.1 per cent to EUR5.48, with the gloom spreading to Germany's Lufthansa, down 9.7 
per cent to EUR15.50, and Spain's Iberia, which fell 9.3 per cent to EUR2.15.
"The airline industry cannot cope with oil at current levels," said Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Credit Suisse. "Airlines 
will have to reduce capacity in order to stay afloat." Mr Khoo said he believed Ryanair would emerge as one of "the 
survivors and winners of this industry downturn", because of its low cost base and strong balance sheet. The Irish 
budget carrier fell 9.9 per cent to EUR2.61.
The week was just as bad for carmakers, with Peugeot down 9.3 per cent to EUR40.79, Fiat 6.2 per cent lower at 
EUR14.38, and Renault falling 8.6 per cent to EUR62.49.
Volkswagen slipped 6.6 per cent to EUR180.80 as the German government agreed a revised law that would allow 
the state of Lower Saxony, which has a minority stake in the company, to make strategic decisions, including 
blocking takeovers.
European airlines buffeted over fuel costs
Porsche, which is looking to increase its 31 per cent stake in VW, tumbled 10.6 per cent to EUR119.42, though the 
European Commission may yet scrap the German law.
In the wider market, fear that expensive oil would squeeze corporate balance sheets and stifle a broader economic 
recovery helped drive the FTSE Eurofirst 300 1.7 per cent lower to 1,322.22 Friday, extending its losses over the 
week to 3.1 per cent. Frankfurt's Xetra Dax fell 1.9 per cent to 6,944.05 and the CAC 40 in Paris slipped 2.8 per 
cent to 4,933.77.
Among the stocks to escape the waves of selling was Edison SpA, the Italian power company.
It rose 6.1 per cent to EUR1.69 after the country's government said it would reintroduce nuclear power to reduce 
energy costs for companies and households.
The rising oil price gave a boost to companies involved in solar and wind power. Norway's Renewable Energy Corp, 
which makes solar cells, rose 0.4 per cent to NKr175.5 and Denmark's Vestas Wind advanced 6 per cent to 
DKr637.
Another big gainer was Deutsche Postbank, which rose 3.7 per cent to EUR62.31 on reports it was the target of a 
joint bid from Commerzbank, down 1.7 per cent to EUR22.19, and Allianz, down 8 per cent to EUR118.52.

European oil companies rose on Thursday as oil stormed to a new record above $135 a barrel, while airlines and 
other fuel consumers got hammered.
Oil companies dominated the leaderboard of the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index, which was down 0.2 per 
cent at 1,338.14 in morning trade.
Frankfurt's Xetra Dax fell 0.5 per cent to 7,006.91, the CAC 40 in Paris eased 0.3 per cent to 5,011.27, while 
London's FTSE 100 climbed 0.4 per cent to 6,218.8.
The biggest gainer on the Eurofirst 300 was Austria's OMV, 6.4 per cent higher at EUR56.90, closely followed by 
Neste Oil, up 4.7 per cent to EUR21.45, and StatoilHydro, the Norwegian producer that was also helped by its 
timely announcement of a gas discovery in the Norwegian Sea. Its shares rose 3.2 per cent to NKr212.80.
Traders piled into companies along the oil supply chain, with SeaDrill, the Norwegian offshore drilling company, 
gaining 2.8 per cent to NKr181.50.
Meanwhile, the prospect of higher jet fuel costs, which is most airlines' biggest expense, prompted traders to punish 
European carriers. Across the Atlantic, global leader American Airlines stoked fears in Europe overnight as it 
announced thousands of job cuts to counter higher costs.
Air France-KLM was the biggest faller on the Eurofirst, down 9.2 per cent to EUR16.92 after it warned that rising 
fuel costs would slash operating costs this year.
Lufthansa fell 3 per cent to EUR16.65 and Irish budget airline Ryanair fell 0.2 per cent to EUR2.57.

The structure of the world airline industry is going to change "profoundly", Jean-Cyril Spinetta, chairman and chief 
executive of Air France-KLM, warned on Thursday, as carriers struggle to come to terms with a doubling of the oil 
price in the past 12 months and weakening economic growth.
"There will be major restructuring. Things are changing violently and quickly," he said.
The outlines of the winners and losers in the latest global aviation crisis are already becoming clear at frightening 
speed.
The long-term survivors will be the airlines with already strong balance sheets, that are going into the storm with low 
debt levels and big cash reserves. Many of these have taken the opportunity offered by their financial strength to 
hedge a large part of their fuel requirements for the next 12 to 24 months.
Financially weaker airlines have been unable to afford such protective insurance.
Some, such as Ireland's Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, chose, to gamble that the oil price would fall 
back. It is now paying the price.
The winners will also be the carriers that have continued to invest in new aircraft and which therefore have the most 
fuel-efficient fleets. They include Ryanair and EasyJet, the dominant European low-cost carriers, and AirAsia, the 
low-cost leader in Asia Pacific.
Among the full service network airlines the winners will include those with the strongest hubs, which can draw in 
feeder traffic from wide regions to fill more seats on their long-haul services and which have the flexibility within 
Airlines face battle for survival
their networks to move capacity around the world from the regions where the economy is weakening to the stronger 
performers.
Airlines likely to emerge more profitable from the crisis and with increased market shares include the European big 
three, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways, from Asia Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Hong Kong's Cathay 
Pacific and Australia's Qantas and from the Middle East Dubai-based Emirates, which is using its location to build a 
true world hub in the Gulf.
Inevitably it is fringe players and recent start-ups that have proved most vulnerable in the first months of the 
unfolding crisis. Specialist all-business class carriers Maxjet Airways and Eos Airlines have already folded. So has 
Oasis Hong Kong Airlines, which tried to bring radically lower fares to long-haul routes between Hong Kong and 
Europe and North America.
Eight US airlines have already filed for bankruptcy protection this year, including established players Frontier and 
Aloha Airlines, and a low-cost start up, Skybus. Of the eight, five have already ceased service, including Maxjet and 
Eos. US carriers had a combined pre-tax loss of nearly $2bn, excluding special items, in the first quarter.
The very biggest in the US are seeking salvation in each other's arms in the hope, possibly misplaced, that mergers 
and consolidation can help to cut costs.
Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines have already announced a plan to merge, while United Airlines, US Airways 
and Continental Airlines ponder which could be the right partner.
The US industry illustrates most starkly how quickly rising fuel bills can bring airlines to the abyss, when they are 
burdened by large numbers of ageing, fuel-guzzling aircraft.
Several leading US airlines are not long out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring after the deep recession of the 
early years of the decade. They are again pressing the panic button after managing neither to restore their balance 
sheets nor to renew their fleets.
American Airlines, the industry leader, has the distinction of being the only US legacy carrier that has not sought 
protection from its creditors in previous downturns. But it is still operating around 300 ageing MD-80s in its short-
haul domestic fleet and. The airline said on Wednesday it would be forced to retire 40 to 45 of them in response to 
record fuel prices. It is also retiring 35 to 40 older regional jets.
In Europe, the long-standing basket case of the industry, Alitalia, is burdened by a large fleet of old MD-80 short-
haul jets and is largely unhedged against the soaring oil price. It is only just being kept alive by the drip feed of the 
latest tranche of state aid.
In Spain, a shake-out is looming among the smaller low cost carriers including Vueling and Clickair, while start-ups 
in Eastern Europe, such as SkyEurope and Wizz Air, could also prove vulnerable to sharply rising fuel bills.
Elsewhere in Europe increasingly loud distress signals are being sent out by Austrian Airlines and SAS 
Scandinavian Airlines.
With the crude oil price around $130 a barrel and jet kerosene costing more than $1,200 a tonne, the level of fuel 
consumption per seat and per tonne of cargo becomes crucial to survival.
Mr Spinetta made much on Thursday of Air France-KLM's fleet renewal programme, where the replacement of 
older four-engined Boeing 747-400 jumbo passenger jets and freighters with twin-engined Boeing 777s is cutting 
fuel consumption 25 per cent per aircraft. Hedging could only offer only a temporary respite from higher fuel costs, 
he said. Only fleet renewal could bring long-term relief.
And for even the strongest there will be pain. British Airways last week reported record profits for the year to March 
and the first 10 per cent operating profit margin in its history.
Airlines face battle for survival
And yet it also warned that $125 oil could wipe away the entire operating profit this year, without further cost-saving, 
fare increases and cuts in capital spending.
Wolfgang Mayrhuber, Lufthansa chief executive, was virtually alone in the global airline industry when he left his 
financial forecast unchanged on Wednesday and said the German national carrier still expected to match or 
surpass last year's record operating earnings in 2008.
Lufthansa is one of the best hedged and most strongly capitalised airlines in the world, and for this year has the 
one-off advantage of a first 12-month consolidation of Swiss. Lufthansa and Air France have already led the 
consolidation process in Europe and remain the most likely predators.
Mr Mayrhuber said ominously that where other airlines were in trouble, Lufthansa would be looking to move in and 
"harvest" their markets.

Carmakers hit reverse, leading European equity markets into their second day of losses and erasing almost all the 
gains made by the bourses since the start of May.
Crude oil hit fresh records, fuelling worries about inflation and drawing a line across Europe between the winners 
and losers of surging commodities prices.
The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,340.63 as Germany's Xetra Dax was dragged 1.1 per cent 
lower by carmakers to 7,040.83.
Bad news from the banking sector added further downward pressure on indices, bringing losses since Tuesday to 
2.7 per cent.
Merrill Lynch cut German sports car maker Porsche from "neutral" to "sell", and the stock fell 4.9 per cent to 
EUR122, driving other carmakers lower. France's Peugeot slid 4.6 per cent to EUR41.79 and Renault dropped 3.3 
per cent to EUR64.73.
"Steel and oil prices keep going up,'' analyst Thomas Besson said, adding that with the dollar holding steady 
against the euro, rising commodities prices could add up to "EUR4bn headwinds" for European carmakers.
"Our new 2009 earnings-per-share estimates are sharply lower than consensus for European automakers,'' Mr 
Besson said.
In Germany, Daimler fell 2.8 per cent to EUR50.93, BMW dropped 4.3 per cent to EUR34.75 and VW retreated 1.2 
per cent to EUR187.18 while Continental, the carparts manufacturer, lost 2.8 per cent to EUR79.20.
Carmakers slam the brakes on bourses
Other decliners included airlines, which continued to feel the pressure of rising oil costs. Ryanair, the budget Irish 
carrier, was down 5.1 per cent to EUR2.62, Deutsche Lufthansa fell 3.1 per cent to EUR16.13, Air France-KLM 
dropped 3.5 per cent to EUR18.65 and Sweden's SAS slid 2.2 per cent to SKr48.30.
Banking stocks were back in the doldrums after Swiss wealth manager UBS said it had completed the sale of 
$15bn in real estate-related assets to New York-based asset manager BlackRock. UBS dropped 3.5 per cent to 
SFr30.64. Domestic rival Credit Suisse fell 2.2 per cent to SFr54.45.
In France, Natixis dropped 5.1 per cent to EUR10.46 after Lehman Brothers cut its price target from EUR15 to 
EUR14.
Irish banks were lower after Bank of Ireland said its earnings would fall in the coming year, triggering a 5.9 per cent 
drop in the shares to EUR8.05. Anglo Irish Bank dropped 6 per cent to EUR8.83.
Crowning the gainers were oil companies. Portugal's Galp Energia rose 5 per cent to EUR17.44 after energy 
groups clawed back lost ground following a sell-off on Tuesday when investors took profits. Austria's OMV rose 6.3 
per cent to EUR56.90.
Italian oilfield services group Saipem rose 2.7 per cent to EUR30.48 and French peer Technip gained 3.4 per cent 
to EUR62.22 after it said its Australian joint venture with Japan's Chiyoda and US company Fluor had won two 
contracts from Australia's Woodside Petroleum to carry out studies covering liquefied natural gas projects.
Also in France, Vallourec, which makes tubes used to build oil rigs and pipelines, gained 2.2 per cent to EUR198, 
mirroring the gleam in industrial metals stocks.
Austria's Voestalpine gained 0.4 per cent to EUR53.03, while Germany's Salzgitter rose 0.7 per cent to EUR133.38 
and Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro added 1.8 per cent to NKr83.40. France's ArcelorMittal was up 0.8 
per cent at EUR64.03.
The top gainer was Italian toll road operator Atlantia, which rose 7.6 per cent to EUR22.71 after Italian authorities 
took emergency steps to approve concession rules between Atlantia and state-owned highway operator ANAS. The 
move paves the way for future tariff increases.

There is no jet fuel in Jim Parker's veins.
Mr Parker, an analyst with Raymond James, the US financial services holding company, is not an amateur pilot. 
And when airline executives he has known and covered over the years have approached him with job offers, he has 
politely declined.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
"I don't care about aeroplanes," Mr Parker says. "I just care about picking stocks and making money. Airlines just 
happen to be the sector I cover."
Clients are thankful Mr Parker holds no romantic notions toward an industry that, more than 50 years after the start 
of the Jet Age, still manages to steal the hearts - and often dent the returns - of many investors.
His track record for steering clients toward the stocks worthy of their affection has garnered Mr Parker this year's 
FT/StarMine Award for Excellence in Investment Analysis.
StarMine has honoured Mr Parker 11 times since it began rating US analysts in 2001. This year, he was one of only 
14 - out of a pool of more than 1,900 eligible analysts - to earn five stars in both picking stocks and forecasting 
earnings.
Mr Parker focuses on so-called growth airlines: the upstarts that have emerged to challenge legacy carriers in the 
years following commercial aviation's deregulation.
Jim Parker: No flights of fantasy for airlines veteran
Today his "outperform" recommendations include Panama's Copa Holdings and Allegiant Travel, which ferries 
small-town Americans to vacation spots in Las Vegas and Florida. His top pick is Ryanair, which he rates a "strong 
buy".
Mr Parker's research career began in 1968, when he joined Robinson-Humphrey, an investment banking boutique. 
He would give it 10 years, Mr Parker thought at the time, then return to school to pursue a PhD.
He stuck with that plan, earning his doctorate in marketing from the University of Georgia, but soon found he 
preferred the immediacy of stock research to the more measured academic world.
Mr Parker's route to the airlines industry was equally unconventional.
He was covering express-delivery companies when Robinson's investment bankers told Mr Parker about a client 
who needed the firm's help in raising $5m to start a commuter airline.
It was 1982, just four years after the US industry's deregulation, and only one upstart - Southwest Airlines - had 
managed to find a lasting niche in a market dominated by legacy carriers such as American Airlines.
The start-up, Atlantic Southeast Airlines, needed research coverage, and the task fell to Mr Parker. ASA, which flies 
commuter jets for Delta Air Lines, is now a unit of SkyWest.
By the 1990s, many more commuter and low-cost carriers had joined Southwest in taking on the behemoths. "They 
brought affordable air travel to the masses," says Mr Parker.
In focusing on this nascent market, Mr Parker had found his own niche, too. "Some of the best things in life happen 
to you by accident," he says.
Twenty-six years later, Mr Parker still follows the same subset of airlines, including Southwest, which remains the 
US's biggest low-cost carrier. But along the way, he says, entrepreneurs from Ireland to Brazil have imported the 
Southwest model to their home countries.
"My investor clients are now looking for growth airline situations all around the world," he says.
For Mr Parker, the search for the next Southwest clone has meant spending a lot of time on aircraft; he has racked 
up 4.5m miles on his frequent-flyer account with Delta.

One in three airline ticket websites are misleading or cheating consumers, a survey in 16 European countries by 
regulators has shown.
Meglena Kuneva, the European consumer affairs commissioner, on Thursday unveiled the results of an 
unprecedented "sweep" by enforcement authorities in countries including France, Italy and Spain. Some 137 of 388 
websites targeted infringed the law, they discovered.
The survey shows there are "serious and persistent problems with ticket sales throughout the airline industry", she 
said. It looked at travel agencies and airline's own sites.
"It is unacceptable that one in three consumers going to book a plane ticket online is being ripped off or mislead 
and confused," she said.
The Norwegian consumer ombudsman said that companies including Blue 1 of Finland, Austrian Airlines and 
Ryanair of Ireland were found to have breached EU consumer law. They had now corrected their practices.
Austrian Airlines was charging a 100 Norwegian Krona booking fee that was not advertised in the ticket price. Blue 
1 included insurance for cancellation as standard. Ryanair included the right to priority boarding as a pre-chosen 
option. Ryanair denies any wrong doing.
Ms Kuneva said that more than half the cases involved misleading pricing, such as adding charges only at the end 
of booking. Most of the rest involved pre-choosing options for clients that they may not have asked for.
Airline websites cheat consumers, survey finds
Half of the infringements have now been dealt with. She is to give an ultimatum of May 1 for the sector act - "or we 
will have no choice but to intervene".
The sweep is likely to be the first of many co-ordinated by the Commission, which wants to show citizens it is on 
their side when dealing with big business. Consumer protection has not kept pace with the expansion of the internal 
market with products and services available across borders, Ms Kuneva believes.
The survey revealed that while the authorities could act swiftly to deal with national problems, it was harder to fix 
those that required action by another EU member state.

UBS led European bourses lower on Tuesday as the Swiss wealth manager slashed jobs, sparking investor jitters 
about the severity of the credit crunch.
By the close of trade, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 had sunk 0.5 per cent to 1,351.25. In France the CAC 40 fell 0.44 per 
cent to 5,040.92, while Germany's Xetra Dax dropped 0.5 per cent to 7017.1.
UBS cast a long shadow over the rest of the banking sector in continental Europe. The bank said it would cut 7 per 
cent of its workforce and has a preliminary deal with US asset manager Blackrock to sell a $15bn porfolio of 
subprime mortgages. It also reported a sharp slowdown in new money flowing into its books from wealthy clients. 
UBS fell 4.5 per cent to 35.2.
Also in Switzerland, Swiss Re dropped 4.8 per cent to SFr83½ after its first quarter net profit dropped by half and it 
unveiled fresh credit writedowns of SFr819m.
Elsewhere in the banking sector Société Générale fell 2.6 per cent to EUR76.40, and Franco-Belgian Dexia fell 3.7 
per cent to EUR17.68.
Tullow Oil surged 24.1 per cent to 927p after a massive oil discovery off the coast of Ghana. This also gave a lift to 
BG Group, which rose 7.1 per cent to £13.50.
But the surging oil price also fuelled worries about the impact of rising energy costs on companies.  Ryanair fell 5.6 
per cent to EUR2.97. The low-cost air carrier said it was currently selling 79 per cent of its seats, compared with 83 
per cent a year earlier.

However, in continental Europe UBS cast a long shadow over the rest of the banking sector. The bank said it would 
cut 7 per cent of its workforce and has a preliminary deal with US asset manager Blackrock to sell a $15bn porfolio 
of subprime mortgages. It also reported a sharp slowdown in new money flowing into its books from wealthy clients. 
UBS fell 6 per cent to 34.70.
Also in Switzerland, Swiss Re dropped 5.8 per cent to SFr82.60 after its first quarter net profit dropped by half, and

The surging oil price fuelled worries about the impact of impact of rising energy costs on companies.  Ryanair fell 
6.3 per cent to EUR2.95. The low cost air carrier said that the number of passengers filling seats on its flights fell to 
79 per cent compared with 83 per cent a year earlier.

Swiss financial companies cast a shadow over European bourses on Tuesday with gloomy first-quarter earnings 
updates  from both Swiss Re and UBS and the wealth manager slashed jobs .
Sentiment was knocked further by a warning across the Atlantic from Fannie Mae, the largest buyer of US 
mortgages, which predicted significant credit losses stretching into 2009.
Philippe Gijsels, senior equities strategist at Fortis Global Markets, said: "We've heard many companies talk about 
the credit crisis stretching through to the end of 2008, but this is the first mention of 2009. If this becomes a trend, it 
will become a very big negative for the financial sector".
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 sank 0.5 per cent to 1,351.25, with bad news from the financial sector overshadowing a 
rally in commodities stocks as oil surged to a fresh high.
UBS said it would cut 7 per cent of its workforce and that it had a preliminary deal with US asset manager Blackrock 
to sell a $15bn portfolio of subprime mortgages. It also reported a sharp slowdown in new money flowing into its 
coffers from wealthy clients. UBS fell 4.5 per cent to SFr35.22, while Credit Suisse lost 2.6 per cent to SFr56.85 and 
Julius Baer sank 3.2 per cent to SFr78.45.
Also in Switzerland, Swiss Re dropped 4.8 per cent to SFr83.45 after its first-quarter net profit fell by half and it 
unveiled fresh credit writedowns of SFr819m.
Other insurers slid lower in Swiss Re's wake, with Munich Re down 1.8 per cent to EUR125 and Allianz off 1.9 per 
cent to EUR131.19 in Germany. Across the border in France, Axa fell 2.1 per cent to EUR24.05.
Swiss financials lead European equities south
Elsewhere in the banking sector Société Généralefell 2.6 per cent to EUR76.40, Franco-Belgian Dexia shed 3.4 per 
cent to EUR17.7 and Austria's Raiffeisen International slid 2.7 per cent to EUR105.44.
European investment banks are likely to see their M&A and capital markets revenues fall by at least 50 per cent this 
year - far more than previously estimated - Morgan Stanley said in a note.
European banking stocks have risen over 20 per cent in the past six weeks but the tide could now be turning, 
analysts said.
"This is the end of the bear market rally," said Mr Gijsels at Fortis, who added that such rebounds typically lasted 
about 35 days.
The surging oil price fuelled worries about the effect of rising energy costs on companies' margins. Ireland's Ryanair 
fell 5.6 per cent to EUR2.97. The low-cost air carrier said the number of passengers filling seats on its flights fell to 
79 per cent against 83 per cent a year earlier.
In France, oil company Total rose 0.1 per cent to EUR54.51 and Gaz de France climbed 2.9 per cent to close at 
EUR42.97. Portugal's Galp Energia jumped 3.2 per cent to finish the day at EUR16.38.
Water group Veolia was the biggest faller on the FTSE Eurofirst 300, dropping 6.3 per cent to EUR43.01 after it 
missed first-quarter profit forecasts.
German sports brand Adidas rose 5.7 per cent to EUR42.7 after it outstripped analysts' estimates with its first-
quarter earnings.
Steel conglomerate ArcelorMittal continued Monday's gains, rising 3.3 per cent to EUR60 on optimism about 
commodities prices, while in Germany ThyssenKrupp climbed 3.4 per cent to EUR42.55.
Poland's WIG20 Index rose for a third day, up 0.2 per cent, to 2,984.34.
PolSat climbed 5.1 per cent to 13.14 zloty on its first day of trading on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The largest 
satellite television operator in central Europe sold 838.5m zloty of shares in an initial public offering last month.

BAA break-up threat clouds Stansted charges

The possible break-up of BAA'S monopoly over London airports has forced the Civil Aviation Authority to postpone 
making firm proposals for the charging regime for Stansted airport.
Instead, the CAA referred the issue on Tuesday to the Competition Commission, suggesting only a range of 
different options for setting prices at the airport.
Stansted, London's third largest airport, was chosen by the government five years ago as its favoured site for the 
first new runway in south-east England for more than 50 years, but the project's future remains unclear amid the 
wider uncertainty about the future ownership of BAA's seven UK airports.
The ability of the CAA, the economic regulator for the three main London airports, Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, 
to set price caps at Stansted for the next five years has also been undermined by its conflict with the government 
over whether there should be any price controls at all at the airport.
The CAA recommended to the government last year that price controls should be removed altogether at Stansted 
and that price setting should be left to the airport and airlines led by Ryanair and EasyJet, the main operators at the 
airport.
The CAA said Stansted did not have and was not likely to acquire "substantial market power."
However, in a serious blow to its authority, its recommendation was rejected by Ruth Kelly, transport secretary, in 
January. Ms Kelly insisted the CAA should continue to set charges at Stansted as the "best way of protecting 
passengers who use the airport."
BAA break-up threat clouds Stansted charges
The CAA said on Tuesday that the choice between its various options for setting price controls at Stansted 
depended upon the extent of competition between the London airports and on establishing which approach was 
best suited to delivering investment in the right facilities at the right time.
The extent of competition would depend on the outcome of the Commission's own separate investigation into the 
structure of BAA.
In an interim report last week on the UK airports market, the Commission attacked BAA's dominant role and said its 
common ownership of seven airports in the south-east of England and Scotland "adversely affected" competition 
and "may not be serving well the interests of either airlines or passengers."
The CAA said on Tuesday that getting the price cap right was important, as it affected the prices paid by airport 
users, the quality of passenger service and the investment the airport could undertake.
As Stansted was competing for passengers and airline services, the price cap could also affect other UK airports.
Harry Bush, CAA group director for economic regulation, said regulating Stansted was "unusually challenging" and 
was made more difficult by the deep disagreement over the scale of future investments at the airport between BAA 
and the airlines.
The CAA has proposed either market-led or precautionary price caps, which could increase charges to airlines to 
between £8.50 and £12.50 per passenger from the current level of £5.50 in 2007-08. Actual charges would 
probably fall below the price caps.
Other options could include putting the development of additional terminal capacity and related facilities out to 
competitive tender, or setting a price cap only on existing airport assets with new investment left outside the regime.
The Competition Commission is expected to report on its own investigation into BAA in August and should report on 
the price cap regime in October. A new set of price controls at Stansted for the next five years is due to come into 
force next April.

Qantas, the Australian flag carrier, announced drastic measures to boost its revenues, cut costs and conserve cash 
in response to the continuing surge in its fuel costs. Geoff Dixon, Qantas chief executive, said the group was 
suspending its share buy-back programme to conserve cash "in light of the fuel price volatility."
Airlines round the world are being forced by rising fuel prices to take action to bolster their profitability.
In the US, Northwest Airlines said it was raising its fares by 3-5 per cent, in line with increases by other leading US 
carriers including United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Continental Airlines.
"We are making this move to offset the extraordinarily high cost of fuel," said Jim Cron, Northwest senior vice-
president of revenue management.
This month the airline announced emergency measures including increased fees, fares and fuel surcharges; 5 per 
cent domestic capacity reductions; a reduction in the fleet of 15-20 aircraft; and an estimated $100m reduction in 
non-aircraft capital expenditure.
Airlines are seeking new ways of increasing revenues and American said it was introducing a $25 charge for 
second bags checked in on domestic routes.
In Europe, Ryanair said  it was raising its fee for checked-in bags from £6 to £8, and that it was raising its charge for 
passengers checking in at the airport rather than online from £3 to £4.
Ryanair has virtually no hedging protection in place for its fuel requirements for the 12 months to March 2009, and 
has warned there is a "significant chance" its profits would fall by as much as 50 per cent this year.
Airlines act to ease fuel bills
Geoff Dixon, Qantas chief executive, said the group was raising its domestic fares by 3.5 per cent and international 
fares sold in Australia by 3 per cent.
He said Qantas had hedged 34 per cent of its fuel requirements for the 12 months to June 2009 at an equivalent 
crude oil price of $90 a barrel, but the majority of the hedges were in the first half of its financial year. "If high fuel 
prices persist beyond this point, it would be of increasing concern." But he said the airline was still confident of 
meeting its target of increasing pre-tax profits by at least 40 per cent in the current year to June 2008.

Ryanair complaint to trigger Alitalia probe

An emergency EUR300m ($470m, £240m) Italian government loan to the loss-making airline Alitalia is to be 
investigated by the European Commission, which could order it to be repaid.
Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, said on Thursday it would file a complaint about the deal, which would trigger a 
commission probe. Any state aid must be vetted and approved by Brussels.
A spokesman for Jacques Barrot, transport commissioner, said: "We have doubts on the nature of the measure and 
we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the Italian authorities claim."
Rome maintains the money is being lent at commercial rates and is vital to keep Alitalia from bankruptcy after Air 
France-KLM pulled out of talks to take it over this week following union opposition. "State aid or no state aid - that is 
the question," the spokesman said. "If state aid, then it should not be paid out before it is authorised."
In practice, there is little Brussels can do to stop the money being handed over. If it rules that it is state aid and must 
be repaid, it can resort to the European court but this can take years.
Still, it marks an early snub to Brussels from Silvio Berlusconi, incoming Italian premier, who pressed the outgoing 
government to lend the money while he casts around for Italian investors to buy the government's 49 per cent 
stake.
Brussels has waved through emergency aid before. Rome guaranteed a EUR400m loan in July 2004 which was 
repaid within six months at commercial rates. The commission says Alitalia cannot receive any more state aid until 
2011. Mr Berlusconi said a coalition of Italian businesses would bid for Alitalia after looking over its books.
Ryanair complaint to trigger Alitalia probe
Paris Anestis, a state aid lawyer at Howrey in Brussels, said Rome's best defence was to argue that a private 
owner would do exactly the same. "They will argue they have to keep it going until privatisation to maintain the 
value of their asset. Liquidation is not an option with an airline."

The emergency EUR300m (£240m, $476m) loan the Italian government extended to loss making airline Alitalia this 
week is on commercial terms and not state aid, Rome told the European Commission on Wednesday night, 
according to the Commission.
Any state aid must be vetted and approved by Brussels but a Commission spokesman told Reuters that Italy would 
not formally notify it of the move because it considered it a commercial arrangement and therefore within the rules.
It had, however passed on documents to Brussels relating to the measures, which are vital to keep Alitalia from 
bankruptcy after Air France-KLM pulled out of talks to take it over this week over union opposition.
"From their point of view this is not state aid, so from their point of view they don't need to formally notify us of state 
aid," the spokesman said. "But they have informed us officially.
"We will analyse it and keep them (Italy) informed about the follow-up we intend to take," the spokesman added.
If Brussels receives a complaint about the deal it is obliged to investigate, however. On Thursday Reuters reported 
that Irish budget airline Ryanair planned to make an official complaint to to Brussels.
Brussels has waved through such arrangements before. Rome guaranteed a EUR400m loan in July 2004 which 
was repaid within six months at commercial rates.
The Commission says Alitalia cannot receive any more state aid until 2011, after it approved a one-off injection of 
EUR1.4bn in 2001.
Rome claims Alitalia loan is not state aid
Silvio Berlusconi, the billionaire incoming premier, said that a coalition of Italian businesses would bid for Alitalia 
after looking over its books in the next few weeks.
Paris Anestis, a state aid lawyer at Howrey in Brussels, said that Rome's best defence was to argue that a private 
owner would do exactly the same.
"They will argue they have to keep it going until privatisation to maintain the value of their asset. Liquidation is not 
an option with an airline. You lose regulatory permission to fly and future revenue as no-one will make advanced

The announcement by Ruth Kelly, transport secretary, of a government review that should lead to a radical 
overhaul of the airport price control regime was welcomed by all sides - airlines, airports and the regulator.
The challenge will be to put in place a system that can support investment in new airport capacity, at reasonable 
prices, while ensuring passengers are provided with a quality of services that will end the airport misery of recent 
years.
While consumers want an end to "Heathrow hassle," the airlines ultimately expect the regulatory system to deliver a 
mechanism to hold the airports in check and moderate future increases in airport charges. They were stunned by 
the scale of the price rises recently approved by the Civil Aviation Authority, the economic regulator.
Three airlines - Easyjet, Ryanair and BMI British Midland - and the International Air Transport Association are 
planning applications for a judicial review of the five-year charging regimes recently approved by the CAA for 
Heathrow and Gatwick airports. Ryanair says it intends to challenge charges at Stansted.
BAA, the owner of all three London airports, believes that, on the contrary, the latest price settlement is squeezing 
its returns and fails to offer sufficient incentive to invest.
Harry Bush, CAA director of economic regulation, said recently that the regulatory regime could be improved "by 
placing the interests of consumers unambiguously at the heart of the CAA's duties and by encouraging competition 
between airports and between airlines for their business".
All sides hail review of price control regime
The present system seeks to reflect the often conflicting interests of airlines, airport operators and passengers. But 
in a clear warning to airlines angered by the scale of price increases at Heathrow and Gatwick, Mr Bush said it was 
"clear that regulatory reform is no magic bullet - airport investments and service quality will still need to be paid for".
The Competition Commission has yet to make its mind up on what regulatory reforms are needed but said it was 
concerned the present system might adversely affect competition.
Any changes to the regulatory system would not come into operation for at least six years, Ms Kelly said yesterday, 
in order not to change the price caps just agreedfor Heathrow and Gatwick (and next year's settlement for 
Stansted) and to give investors at least some medium-term certainty on the financial outlook.
The airport regime, put in place in 1986, is one of the oldest economic regulatory systems in the UK and Ms Kelly 
accepted there was an "urgent need" to consider how the framework could be updated.
She said the government review would focus on how to provide incentives to improve the passenger experience, 
"encourage appropriate and timely investment in additional airport capacity to help deliver economic growth", and 
address the environmental impact of aviation on airport development.
A panel of experts led by Professor Martin Cave, a regulatory economist and director of the centre for management 
under regulation at Warwick Business School, will be appointed to advise her. The CAA has already made clear 
that it wants the scope of its powers to be brought into line with those of the other independent utility regulators 
including Ofcom, Ofwat and Ofgem in the telecoms, water and electricity sectors.
Currently, as the commission report pointed out, the CAA has only limited powers to intervene in an airport's 
business, once the price caps have been set for five years.
In addition BAA, unlike other utilities, is not subject to a licence.
Importantly there are no provisions to ring-fence the assets of any airport or for a special administration regime in 
the event that BAA was to get into financial difficulties.

EasyJet and Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airlines, are threatening to refuse to pay higher charges to BAA, 
the UK airport operator, and are planning to pursue judicial reviews of the price rises.
EasyJet is protesting against the new price regime at Gatwick airport, its biggest UK base, while Ryanair is 
opposing the latest price rises at Stansted.
BAA warned the airlines they were legally obliged to pay charges in full, pending the resolution of any dispute. 
Separately, BMI British Midland is examining whether to seek a judicial review of the price increases at Heathrow. 
The airlines are fighting the decision by the Civil Aviation Authority, the regulator, in March to sanction a jump in 
charges per passenger at Heathrow by 86 per cent, from £10.36 to £19.31, over the next five years. At Gatwick, 
charges per passenger will rise by 49 per cent, from £5.61 to £8.36, including a 21 per cent increase this year.
After the CAA's ruling, the airlines launched a fierce attack on the economic regulation of the three London airports. 
Four of the largest airlines operating from the UK - BMI, EasyJet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic - demanded a 
complete overhaul of the regulatory system and a break-up of BAA's London airports monopoly.
The four carriers said the "dramatic" price rises at Heathrow and Gatwick demonstrated that the system was 
"broken and needs to be changed".
EasyJet said it had told BAA that it intended to withhold part of the price increase being imposed on it at Gatwick, 
pending the outcome of a judicial review. It is expected to file the application for the judicial review within three 
weeks.
Rising BAA charges lead to rebellion
Andy Harrison, EasyJet chief executive, said the airline considered the CAA's decision on airport charges to be 
"unlawful and damaging for the airlines, our passengers and the industry as a whole". EasyJet said it had received 
no reply from BAA after writing four weeks ago to seek its agreement that any decision by the courts that charges 
were too high would see the difference returned to the airline, so that passengers could be refunded.
In a letter to Colin Matthews, BAA chief executive, Mr Harrison has proposed withholding part of the new £6.79 per 
passenger charge this year at Gatwick, with the amount to be kept in a separate account pending the outcome of 
the legal challenge.
Ryanair said it would withhold payment of the latest increases at Stansted if BAA imposed the maximum allowed 
price rises. Stansted airport warned Ryanair that it would take any action deemed "appropriate" to recover any 
underpayment.
Gatwick airport said it would "continue to charge in accordance with the CAA's decision".

In a mid-air crisis, only the pilot really knows what is happening, but even first-time flyers can distinguish a dive from 
a cruise. The trajectory of shares in Silverjet has shown that investor confidence in the UK-based business-class 
airline is dropping. Until Wednesday, that is, when the stock jumped 17 per cent, obliging the company to announce 
Thursday that it was in talks that might lead to a takeover and prompting another 40 per cent rise in the stock.
Like aviation ventures since the days of Orville and Wilbur Wright, Silverjet was borne aloft only last year on a 
heady combination of aviation fuel and optimism. But you'd need a lot of the latter to buy in now. Passenger 
numbers and load factors have increased steadily since December - but so they should at a start-up that is adding 
routes. Ahead of a trading update due this month, it is hard to assess just how profitably those seats are being 
filled. The rest of the news has been gloomy. Two UK property developers declined to convert their loan to the 
group into equity in February.
A long-standing target of recording a pre-tax profit in March was missed. Silverjet is unhedged against the rising 
fuel costs that are making even established budget airlines, such as Ryanair and EasyJet, suffer. And if it's portents 
you're after, then Asian start-up Oasis Hong Kong Airlines collapsed on Wednesday.
Who, then, would want to buy this, or any airline, in the present climate? One investor in the company told 
Bloomberg on Thursday that Silverjet's aircraft and other assets could be worth GBP30m.
A trade buyer could purchase the entire group at roughly its equity value of some GBP13m in order to repay a 
GBP10m loan and hang on to the planes - but that would involve some racy assumptions about the second-hand 
value of Boeing 767s. Alternatively, Silverjet represents a theoretical hedge against a turn in the commodities cycle 
for oil-enriched potentates. But it would be easier to offset exposure to crude by buying the beaten-down shares of 
better-established companies. Plenty of passengers would like to see the Silverjet model continue, as its business-

class services to the US and the Gulf undercut rivals. But for ordinary investors who don't take this opportunity to 
bale out, the message seems clear: brace, brace.
Benettons' style revolt
The Benettons should have better things to do than blunder into the corporate governance dispute at Generali. The 
famous Italian textile family, which owns 1 per cent of Generali, has proposed a candidate to be elected to head the 
insurer's internal audit committee at the company's annual meeting later this month.
By doing so, they have pitched their candidate, Giuseppe Pirola, against rivals proposed by, among others, 
Algebris,  the UK hedge fund waging a high-profile campaign for change at Generali.
The audit body has three members. Two are likely to come from a list put up by Generali's main shareholders, of  
which the largest is Mediobanca, the investment bank. The third, the committee's chairman, is reserved to the most  
popular candidate among minority shareholders such as Algebris.
In the country of conspiracy theories, the problem is that the Benettons are considered by some of doing 
Mediobanca a favour by trying to make life difficult for Algebris. The Benettons might well be minority investors at 
Generali, but they certainly have strong ties to Mediobanca. The two are shareholders in the controlling bloc at 
Telecom Italia; the Benettons are in the controlling bloc of Mediobanca itself; and Mediobanca is one of so far three 
large investors in the Benettons' expanded infrastructure interests.
When the Benettons presented Mr Pirola as a possible "minority" candidate, Consob, the Italian market regulator, 
asked the Benettons to explain just how they considered themselves outside the power structure at Generali.
The clothing family and the insurer responded by insisting there were no ties between the Benettons and 
Mediobanca over Generali. Consob wants more clarification and Algebris says it is considering legal action.
Assuming no conflicts of interest, no favours being played and nothing irregular, the controversy is nonetheless 
turning into an embarrassing public relations mess for the Benettons by casting suspicions on their motives and 
embroiling them in tedious regulatory inquiries.
This is not the usual Benetton style. The family group has always sought to distance itself from the Byzantine world  
of Italian politics and business. But perhaps they are feeling they should be playing a more visible role in Italian 
corporate affairs now that they are investors in everything from railway stations and airports to motorways and 
roadside restaurants. If so, they seem to have got off on the wrong footing.

Tide goes out for world's airlines

The sudden collapse of Oasis Hong Kong Airlines shows how quickly the tide is going out for the world's airlines as 
they struggle to deal with surging fuel prices and softening economic growth.
Start-up carriers such as Oasis are especially vulnerable, and inevitably it is the new business models, usually 
dreamed up in the years of feast, that start to look most at risk in times of famine.
One of the first casualties of the accelerating shake-out was Maxjet, a pioneer of the new breed of all-business 
class carriers that began springing up to fly the North Atlantic three years ago.
Maxjet, US-registered but listed on Aim, London's junior market, collapsed into bankruptcy at the end of last year.
It blamed its demise on fuel price inflation, tough competitive pressures and a decline in consumer spending.
In addition, the turmoil in the financial markets had made it impossible to raise fresh funds.
In recent weeks, at least five other US carriers have thrown in the towel, including small charter airlines.
But the casualties include Skybus, a start-up low-cost carrier with new orders in place with Airbus for 65 A319 jets, 
and well-known names such as Aloha Airlines with more than 60 years of history and ATA.
Leading US airlines are reducing capacity in the domestic market, grounding old short-haul aircraft and are 
scrambling to try to increase fares as they struggle to come to terms with an oil price of more than $100 a barrel.
Tide goes out for world's airlines
In Europe, Alitalia, the perennially lossmaking Italian flag carrier, is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy while the 
Italian unions decide whether or not to accept big job cuts and a shrinking of the airline in return for a last-ditch 
rescue by Air France-KLM.
Among the industry leaders, British Airways has already warned that profit will decline significantly during the next 
12 months. Both Ryanair and EasyJet, Europe's two biggest low-cost airlines, have issued profit warnings, with 
Ryanair saying its profit could fall by as much as 50 per cent under the impact of rising oil prices and falling fare 
levels.
"When the tide goes out, you find the business models that were never really sustainable," says Chris Avery, 
aviation analyst at JPMorgan.
Oasis Hong Kong styled itself as a low-cost long-haul carrier but in reality it was more a low-fare airline with a mix of 
some of the elements of the short-haul low- cost carriers that have proved so successful, alongside some of the 
high-cost elements of the traditional full service, long-haul carriers.
Asia has become the world's fastest-growing aviation market and Derek Sadubin, chief operating officer at the 
Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, a Sydney-based consultancy, says the collapse of Oasis was unlikely to stop "a 
proliferation of new airlines in this region in the next few years".
He says Oasis had made some specific, questionable choices, however, notably devoting almost 25 per cent of its 
seating capacity to business passengers, thereby reducing the total number of seats available.
Oasis was also flying four-engine Boeing 747-400 aircraft, consuming more fuel than twin-engine aircraft.
Furthermore, as a standalone company, it did not have the brand recognition and internet booking synergies that 
airlines such as Jetstar and AirAsia X can derive.
Mark Webb, Hong Kong-based transport analyst for HSBC, says the fate of Oasis "indicates that the low-cost long-
haul model is problematic".
He adds: "Low-cost regional and short-haul models have been working in other markets but long-haul, low-cost 
hasn't really worked anywhere else either. Nobody has been able to do a profitable low-cost, long-haul carrier."
Still, Stephen Miller, Oasis chief executive, last night defended his airline's business model.
"It just needed a little more time and a little more network [destinations], and a critical mass of aircraft,'' he told the 
Financial Times. "What Oasis has shown is that the business model is accepted by  the market."
Analysts also said on Wednesday that the demise of Oasis would not halt moves by some Asian legacy carriers to 
develop low-cost offshoots.
Among them, All Nippon Airways, the second-largest Japanese airline, recently established an Asian strategy unit 
in Hong Kong to look at regional expansion opportunities and forge ties with possible joint venture partners for the 
launch of a low-cost airline.
Azran Osman-Rani, chief executive of Malaysia-based AirAsia X, said on Wednesday that "the Oasis example 
reinforces our view that a sustainable low-cost, long-haul airline model must stick to core principles of high aircraft  
utilisation and high seat density to achieve a sustainable cost position".
He added: "But more importantly, it is always a bigger challenge to start up a new airline from scratch."

Oasis Hong Kong Airlines, the start-up Asian carrier that sought to bring the low-cost airline business model into the 
long-haul sector, was forced to halt all operations on Wednesday as it collapsed into financial liquidation.
It is latest casualty in the growing shake-up of global aviation as carriers struggle to cope with record oil prices  and 
weakening economic growth.
At least five US airlines including Skybus, a start-up low-cost short-haul carrier, Aloha Airlines and ATA have 
collapsed in recent weeks, suffering the same fate as Maxjet Airways, the pioneer all-business class, transatlantic 
carrier, which went into liquidation in December.
In Europe, Alitalia, the heavily lossmaking Italian flag carrier, is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and several  
leading airlines including British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet have issued profit warnings. Recent start-ups and 
smaller operators have been most vulnerable to date but some analysts have already begun to warn of losses 
exceeding $4bn in the US industry this year.
Oasis Hong Kong Airlines began flying in October 2006 between Hong Kong and London Gatwick offering fares 
that radically undercut the existing carriers in the market such as Cathay Pacific, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. 
It added a second route between Hong Kong and Vancouver last year with a fleet of four aircraft and had announ- 
ced a five-year plan for it to grow to a fleet of 25 Boeing 747-400s with possible routes to include San Francisco, 
Chicago, Sydney, Milan in Italy and Cologne/Bonn in Germany.
The price of jet fuel has jumped from $600 a tonne when Oasis began flying to a current level of around $1,137 a 
tonne.
Low-cost pioneer Oasis collapses
Oasis was founded by several Hong Kong investors with starting capital of $100m led by Reverend Raymond Lee, 
who also has US east coast property interests. In November it attracted $30m in investment from a private equity 
fund run by Value Partners, the Hong Kong fund manager.
Unlike its more successful low-cost peers in short-haul markets, Oasis's service also included hot meals and inflight 
entertainment. Mark Webb, a Hong Kong-based transport analyst for HSBC, said Oasis's cost structure differed 
little from legacy airlines such as Cathay.
Stephen Miller, Oasis chief executive, said on Wednesday the company had applied to Hong Kong courts for a 
voluntary  liquidation and was seeking new investors.

EU closer to in-flight mobile phone use

Mobile phone use on aircraft flying in European airspace moved closer to commercial reality on Monday after 
regulatory backing for a European Union-wide approach to technical standards for the service.
The decision by the European Commission to harmonise technical and licensing rules should boost the introduction 
of the technology, which is already under commercial trial by Air France-KLM.
BMI British Midland and TAP Air Portugal will also conduct tests, while Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, is 
expected to be the first airline to make widespread use of the service with a plan to begin introducing it across its 
fleet this year.
Under Monday's decision, passengers' mobile phones will be linked to an onboard network connected to the ground 
via satellite.
Travellers will have to switch off their handsets for take-off and landing, with phones allowed to be used once 
aircraft are at altitudes above 3,000 metres.
Viviane Reding, EU telecoms commissioner, said: "One regulatory decision for all European airspace was required  
for this new service to come into being."
Ms Reding last year brought legislation that forced telecoms companies to slash the fees customers pay for cross-
border phone use, but those rules would not apply to in-flight calls. However, she would "closely monitor" prices 
levied for the new service.
EU closer to in-flight mobile phone use
National licences for in-flight mobile use granted to airlines by the member state in which they are registered will  be 
recognised throughout the 27-country union.
The Air France trial service has been operating on an Airbus A318 flying on short-haul routes in Europe.
When the trial began in December, passengers were able to send and receive text and picture messages as well as 
e-mails via phones with internet access.
The second stage of the six-month trial was launched last week, and passengers are now able to make and receive 
voice calls.
Many airlines are still wary about introducing the full use of mobile phones because of the disturbance to other 
passengers. Surveys have shown that passenger opinion is sharply divided, with similar numbers for and against 
in-flight mobile use.
Air France said passenger feedback had been positive so far. Findings from the trial would help decide whether the 
airline would offer data only or data and voice services. Calls are billed via users' existing service providers at 
international roaming rates.
The carrier is using the on-board mobile phone service developed by OnAir, a joint venture owned by Airbus and 
Sita.  A rival system has been developed by AeroMobile, a joint venture between Arinc and Telenor.

Score one for Carl Icahn. The 72-year-old billionaire investor was granted his biggest demand from Motorola on 
Wednesday when the company agreed to split into two companies.
Icahn, the corporate raider turned shareholder activist, has been putting pressure on the troubled mobile phone 
maker to split out its handset unit for a while. As Observer pointed out this week, he also wants to install four 
directors on the board - and the company seems OK with three of them.
Icahn has a lot riding on a rebound at Motorola - he has spent $2bn on the company's shares, giving him a stake  of 
roughly 6.5 per cent.
Despite the victory, though, Icahn is likely to continue pressing the company.
The stock rose on Wednesday but Icahn bought Motorola shares while they were in a steep decline - and it still has 
a  way to climb back before he is making big money.
Icahn has proved successful recently at getting the top brass at big US companies to listen to him. His sometimes 
bitter rhetoric about Time Warner and Dick Parsons, then chief executive, resulted in a change or two. But his 
campaign  didn't exactly set the media group's shares on fire, either.
Icahn will want a clearer victory from Motorola. Observer doesn't expect him to let up too much on the company,  
even though he has just won a decisive victory in round one.

Nicolas Sarkozy's visit to Westminster on Wednesday drew a large crowd of MPs and Lords, some of whom had 
come to see the president. Most, however, seemed to have come to see the latest Mrs Sarkozy, singer Carla Bruni, 
whose days as a nude model were fondly recaptured in the British press on Wednesday.
Ms Bruni listened demurely as Sarko ladelled litres of French syrup over his British audience, until they rolled over 
in submission.
But there was a moment of humour as Michael Martin, the Commons Speaker, welcomed his French guests to the 
Royal Gallery in the House of Lords, innocently announcing that its decor had a very strong French connection.
Queue laughter - the most obvious features of the Royal Gallery are the two enormous friezes depicting Britain's 
victory over France at Waterloo and Trafalgar. Martin seemed bemused. He simply meant that Westminster's 
famous interior designer, Augustus Pugin, was the son of a French emigre.
Slave to work
Michael O'Leary, the motormouth boss of Ryanair, is famous for dressing up at press conferences. His most 
notorious guise was as the Pope but on Wednesday he donned (not literally, unfortunately) a hair shirt.
O'Leary announced that he and 35 other senior executives would forgo a pay increase this year as profits are set to 
dive because of high oil prices.
Not that he will starve on 565,000 a year, excluding bonus and pension.
Still, he is working harder for it. "I am married with two young children under the age of two-and-a-half and have 
discovered for the first time in my life that many of the joys of fatherhood [lead you] to spend more time at the 
office," he said. "The office is more attractive than changing nappies or getting up in the night."
And in spite of saying he will only stick around for another two or three years, it is too early to talk of retirement 
plans.
"Remember, Ryanair is the most fun you can have with your clothes on."
Perhaps not if you are jammed in the back row on the 6.30am to Dublin.
More to come
The primary contest between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is beginning to look a bit like trench warfare. 
Clinton  is leading in Pennsylvania, while Obama is leading in North Carolina. It appears that the fighting will 
continue until early summer without a clear result.
But there is damage being done, and it is not to John McCain, who has had a good run in the polls this month. And 
a fascinating poll this week by Rasmussen Reports showed that 22 per cent of Democratic voters across the US 
said Clinton  should drop out of the race. An identical number say Obama should quit.
Not surprisingly, Clinton thinks her continued presence in the race is not harming the chance of a Democrat being 
elected in November. "Millions of people still remain to vote and to have their votes counted, so I think it's exciting 
and I find it very positive for our party," she told Time magazine's Mark Helprin this week. "We're going to have a 
unified Democratic party and we'll go into the fall in a strong position to defeat John McCain."
Clinton, while trailing Obama in the delegate count, went on to suggest that history was on her side.
"I remind a lot of people that my husband didn't formally wrap up the nomination until June and when he did he was 
behind both President Bush and Ross Perot."
Wrong address

The revelation that the US military mistakenly shipped fuses for nuclear missiles to Taiwan - it had meant to send 
helicopter batteries instead - has left many wondering how a blunder involving sensitive arms technology could 
happen. But looking at the Pentagon's attempts at explaining the mix-up, one could come to the conclusion that it 
could actually have been much worse.
Anyone reading the transcript of the press conference that the Pentagon held to explain the situation could be 
forgiven for worrying the problems go even deeper than a mistaken shipment. The text shows Ryan Henry, principal 
deputy  undersecretary, speaking about China - not Taiwan - having received the shipment.
"Yeah, I would say - and these are just initial gathering of information - it appears from the - fairly early on the 
Chinese indicated to us that they did not have in receipt what they had asked for," Henry said, according to the 
official transcript.
Surely just a slip-up on his part. After all, if you can confuse Taiwan, an island the US is committed to help defend, 
with China, the country this defence is directed against, then there is not really such a big difference between 
missile fuses and helicopter batteries either.
Fed up
Naples' trash problems are reaching all corners of the globe. South Korea has banned Italian buffalo mozzarella  
from being sold on its territory, after reports that the dioxins in the cheese were above the acceptable level.
Italian police have been looking into allegations that huge piles of rubbish blighting the Neapolitan region have 
tainted herd feed. Korean fans of mozzarella di bufala will be in despair.

Q: How do you know what you'll get to eat on a flight On a recent mid-morning flight from London City Airport to 
Zurich in BA economy I was provided with a sandwich. On the return flight (to Gatwick), scheduled to depart at 
7pm, there was nothing but a packet of nibbles - even though it was dinnertime. The stewardess told me the flight 
was too short for meal service. Why the inconsistency JC, UK-based consultant.
A: There doesn't appear to be any reliable, central source of information on the type of food you'll get. It appears 
airlines are anxious to keep their options open. For example, information on one flight provided by timetable 
specialist OAG showed there might either be no meal service or catering "appropriate to the time of day". And  an 
early-morning flight from Edinburgh to Amsterdam, presented as an option via KDS self-booking tool, showed 
passengers would be offered a "snack or brunch".
BA tells me it tries to tailor food to the time of day. "We recognise that sometimes due to operational difficulties or 
delays some customers are regrettably eating maybe a mid-afternoon snack into the evening when they should be 
having a more substantial amount of food.
"We are constantly reviewing what types of free food and drinks we do offer to ensure that we stay competitive.  
Many...airlines now charge substantial amounts ... [but] BA has no plans to charge customers for on-board meals 
and drinks."
Q: Why don't airlines just weld seats upright in economy class. Personally, I never recline. I don't see how anyone 
gets anything out of reclining a seat six degrees. However, when you do, it makes a huge difference to the 
passenger behind you. Their already minimal space is cut in half. Can't eat, can't use a laptop, even reading  can 
be a challenge.

I have the sneaking suspicion that people recline only out of habit or to assert privilege and not because they 
actually gain any comfort. The worst are those who recline the seat as they sit down when first getting on the plane, 
grudgingly raise it when told to for take off and then slam it back as soon as the plane hits 10,000 feet.PBJ software

A: It seems you could become a big fan of Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair, none of whose aircraft has reclining seats. 
This is not out of consideration for long-legged customers, however, but to keep maintenance costs down. Why 
don't  more airlines do it? The world's largest, American Airlines, says it tries to strike a balance between the user 
and the passenger in the seat behind. "It would not be practical to lock seats upright for very short flights of an hour, 
say, when the same aircraft might have to be used for longer flights. A few years back a Washington-based 
company  created a stir by coming up with a small device* that passengers could use to lock the seat in front into 
an upright position. According to the company's website this is still available. American considered whether to ban 
the device. In the UK ,the Civil Aviation Authority considered doing likewise. But the US airline says: "If we had 
seen anyone using it we would have stopped them because you can't have passengers interfering with equipment 
that needs  safety certification.

with a 10-hour stopover, the officer wrote "W" and circled it. What does a circled "W" mean on a stamp? Am I now 
on a watch list because I fly through Heathrow often? As far as I know I do not need a visa for work or leisure visits 
and surely I don't need one to change flights.WF professional photographer, San Francisco
A: The answer appears to lie in the number of times you have entered the UK. I have checked with the Home 
Office, which says that, although travellers making occasional business trips to Britain do not need visas, those 
coming frequently are required to apply for them.
The "W" in your passport is an indication this time you were allowed entry at the discretion of the immigration officer 
and to alert colleagues to this fact next time you come. However, I and the Home Office are surprised that the 
officer failed to explain this to you. You should surely not have been left in doubt and if this is a frequent omission 
by immigration staff, it surely needs to be addressed.

European equity markets charged ahead Tuesday with banking stocks leading the rally as the continent's bourses 
got their first chance to react to Monday's news that JPMorgan had increased its offer for Bear Stearns.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 was 3.2 per cent higher at 1,266.03 as investors backed the financial sector 
across the continent on hopes the move marked the beginning of the end of the subprime crisis.
"The Bear Stearns story has buoyed banking stocks, which have taken a battering over the last week. It's a  bit of a 
relief bounce, but the big question is whether these index levels can now be sustained," said Jimmy Yates, head of 
European trading at CMC Markets.
"We're not out of the woods yet. The underlying problems in the credit market haven't gone away," he said.
Stocks that had felt the most pain before Easter made the sharpest recoveries. Hypo Real Estate, the German 
property  lender, soared 12 per cent to 14.92 in the wake of better than expected home sales data in the US on 
Monday. The data raised hopes the US property market may have bottomed out and gave a shot in the arm to 
lenders in Europe.
Anglo Irish Bank was another star performer, surging 11.5 per cent to 8.75 after taking a pummelling last week on 
liquidity fears.
Other banks that had been providing grist for the rumour mill also bounced back. Switzerland's two big financial 
stocks shrugged off recent fears of further big writedowns, with UBS rising 8.2 per cent to SFr30.20 and Credit 
Suisse 6.3 per cent higher at SFr51.55.
Banks propel Europe ahead on fresh Bear offer
Germany's Commerzbank gained 8.9 per cent to 18.84 after Credit Suisse upgraded its rating from "neutral" to 
"outperform", saying credit worries had already been substantially priced into the stock, which was better placed 
than that of many banks to weather turmoil in the credit market. Domestic rival Deutsche  Bankrose 4.6 per cent to 
73.50.
German exchange operator Deutsche Borse, which also lost ground last week, added 7.8 per cent to 105.65.
The aviation sector was in focus with Irish budget airline Ryanair rising 8.7 per cent to 2.99 as the price of oil fell. 
Alitalia rocketed 32.3 per cent to 0.46 on reports that Air France-KLM would extend its talks with labour unions  over 
its offer for the Italian carrier. Air France edged up 0.2 per cent to 17.33.
Debt-laded Telecom Italia advanced 10.6 per cent to 1.34 on hopes that the company was finalising the sale of its 
French unit Alice. The stock hit a 10-year low last week at 1.148 but dealers said confidence in the stock was 
boosted  after key shareholders paid 150m to raise their stake in the company on Thursday.
Telecommunication hardware companies also staged a rebound, recovering some of last week's losses after the 
chief executive of sector leader Nokia said the company had not been badly affected by the downturn in the US 
economy. Nokia rose 8.2 per cent to 20.01 while Sweden's Ericsson climbed 4 per cent to 11.31 and France's

As cyclical stocks moved back into the foreground, defensive stocks lost steam with Belgian brewer InBev down 3.4 
per cent to 54.81.
French utility giant EDF fell 2.2 per cent to 54.62 after Spanish rival Iberdrola denied a report in the French press 
that it had offered EDF a 20 per cent stake.
Iberdrola rose 3.2 per cent to 10.50, while Inmobiliaria Colonial, the heavily geared Spanish construction company,  
jumped 14 per cent to 0.89 after saying it still had the support of its main creditors.

European equity markets charged ahead Tuesday with banking stocks leading the rally as the continent's bourses 
got their first chance to react to Monday's news that JPMorgan had increased its offer for Bear Stearns.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 was 3.2 per cent higher at 1,266.03 as investors backed the financial sector 
across the continent on hopes the move marked the beginning of the end of the subprime crisis.
"The Bear Stearns story has buoyed banking stocks, which have taken a battering over the last week. It's a  bit of a 
relief bounce, but the big question is whether these index levels can now be sustained," said Jimmy Yates, head of 
European trading at CMC Markets.
"We're not out of the woods yet. The underlying problems in the credit market haven't gone away," he said.
Stocks that had felt the most pain before Easter made the sharpest recoveries. Hypo Real Estate, the German 
property  lender, soared 12 per cent to 14.92 in the wake of better than expected home sales data in the US on 
Monday. The data raised hopes the US property market may have bottomed out and gave a shot in the arm to 
lenders in Europe.
Anglo Irish Bank was another star performer, surging 11.5 per cent to 8.75 after taking a pummelling last week on 
liquidity fears.
Other banks that had been providing grist for the rumour mill also bounced back. Switzerland's two big financial 
stocks shrugged off recent fears of further big writedowns, with UBS rising 8.2 per cent to SFr30.20 and Credit 
Suisse 6.3 per cent higher at SFr51.55.
Banks propel Europe ahead on fresh Bear offer
Germany's Commerzbank gained 8.9 per cent to 18.84 after Credit Suisse upgraded its rating from "neutral" to 
"outperform", saying credit worries had already been substantially priced into the stock, which was better placed 
than that of many banks to weather turmoil in the credit market. Domestic rival Deutsche  Bankrose 4.6 per cent to 
73.50.
German exchange operator Deutsche Borse, which also lost ground last week, added 7.8 per cent to 105.65.
The aviation sector was in focus with Irish budget airline Ryanair rising 8.7 per cent to 2.99 as the price of oil fell. 
Alitalia rocketed 32.3 per cent to 0.46 on reports that Air France-KLM would extend its talks with labour unions  over 
its offer for the Italian carrier. Air France edged up 0.2 per cent to 17.33.
Debt-laded Telecom Italia advanced 10.6 per cent to 1.34 on hopes that the company was finalising the sale of its 
French unit Alice. The stock hit a 10-year low last week at 1.148 but dealers said confidence in the stock was 
boosted  after key shareholders paid 150m to raise their stake in the company on Thursday.
Telecommunication hardware companies also staged a rebound, recovering some of last week's losses after the 
chief executive of sector leader Nokia said the company had not been badly affected by the downturn in the US 
economy. Nokia rose 8.2 per cent to 20.01 while Sweden's Ericsson climbed 4 per cent to 11.31 and France's 
Alcatel-Lucent added 7.1 per cent to 3.62.
As cyclical stocks moved back into the foreground, defensive stocks lost steam with Belgian brewer InBev down 3.4 
per cent to 54.81.

Shares in EasyJet tumbled in early London trading on Wednesday as the low-cost airline warned that escalating 
fuel costs could pare second half profits.
As recently as February 7 the company said in a trading statement that full-year pre-tax profits were on course to be 
20 per cent up on the previous year's GBP202m.
But a 20 per cent rise in the forward price of jet fuel since then to more than $1,000 a tonne could not be mitigated 
by cost cutting or raising prices in the short term, EasyJet said. That will hit second-half earnings although the first 
half will be unaffected.
EasyJet said it had hedged some 40 per cent of its total requirements at $750 a tonne but the sharp rise in recent 
costs would lead to GBP45m of additional fuel costs in the second half.
EasyJet shares fell as much as 17 per cent to 310lp in morning trade. By mid-morning they were down 61lp or 16.4 
per  cent at 313lp.
EasyJet is the latest airline to warn that rising fuel costs will affect trading. Earlier this month British Airways  
blamed the soaring price of crude oil for a profits warning and said its fuel costs would rise to GBP2.5bn next year.
Ryanair, Europe's most profitable airline, warned in February that rising fuel costs, deteriorating consumer 
confidence and the weak pound would put severe pressure on costs. The airline said profits for its next financial 
year could fall by as much as 50 per cent.
"The price of fuel will hit all airlines," said Andy Harrison, easyJet chief executive.
EasyJet plunges on fuel costs warning
Revenues are continuing to perform well, the company said in an unscheduled statement to the market. Load 
factors in  February were 1.8 percentage points up at 84.8 per cent with trading for the Easter period on track.
Analysts at Numis said they had reduced their 2008 pre-tax profit forecast to GBP184.1m but if consumer 
confidence waned they could be revised further downwards.

Stansted runway application spurs protests

BAA, the airports operator, on Tuesday applied for planning permission to build a second runway and terminal at 
London Stansted airport, triggering fierce opposition from environmental campaigners, residents and local 
authorities.
The Stop Stansted Expansion campaign said the planning application went "beyond environmental vandalism" and 
was "tantamount to a declaration of war on the local community and global environment".
BAA said the first phase of the GBP2.5bn ($5bn) project could open in 2015 and could create capacity to handle 
68m passengers a year - as many as at Heathrow currently - by around 2030. This would more than double the 
present capacity  limit on the existing runway of 25m passengers a year.
BAA is still waiting for the government's decision on a previous planning inquiry to raise the single runway capacity 
limit to 35m passengers a year.
Sir Nigel Rudd, BAA chairman, said the operator remained "fully committed" to building a second runway, which 
was "central to government policy" for delivering additional runway capacity in the south-east.
The project would bring "huge benefits to the east of England and UK economy" and would "increase choice and 
opportunity for millions of business and leisure travellers", Sir Nigel said.
If approved, the second runway would be the first full-length runway in the south-east in 50 years.
A prolonged battle is looming over aviation policy, with the government also separately supporting the building of a  
third runway and sixth terminal at Heathrow by late in the next decade.
Stansted runway application spurs protests
A December 2003 aviation white paper called for the building of two new runways in the south-east, led by a 
second runway at Stansted.
Airport charges at Stansted would have to rise steeply to support the investment, which has triggered vocal 
opposition from operators at the airport, led by Ryanair and EasyJet. The Civil Aviation Authority, the airports 
economic regulator, has ruled out any cross-subsidisation by BAA of Stansted from its Heathrow and Gatwick 
airports.
BAA said the Stansted project could lead to the creation of more than 13,000 jobs by 2030. The development would 
take place in phases with construction expected to start in 2011 and first operations planned for 2015.
The first phase of the scheme by 2015 would cost GBP1.4bn with subsequent stages raising the total cost to 
GBP2.5bn,  including BAA's contribution to improved road and rail links to the airport.
Essex county council warned on Tuesday that the development of Stansted would bring "significant environmental 
damage whilst placing a huge strain on existing public services and infrastructure".
Lord Hanningfield, leader of the council, said: "This is not what the people of Essex want and it is not what the 
people of Britain need. The economics and business case behind this ... totally contradicts the government's so-
called commitment to protecting the environment as well as reducing emissions."

BAA monopoly on airports under fire

Airlines on Tuesday launched a fierce attack on the economic regulation of the three leading London airports, as 
the  Civil Aviation Authority announced a big increase in the charges BAA, the airport operator, can set at Heathrow 
and Gatwick.
The attack came as a CAA official disclosed that BAA would be unable to meet its original aim of completing the 
planned GBP1bn Heathrow East terminal in time for the London Olympics in the summer of 2012.
Four of the largest airlines operating from the UK - BMI British Midland, EasyJet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic - joined 
forces in an unusual display of unity to demand an overhaul of the regulatory system and a break-up of the BAA 
London airports monopoly.
BAA's structure is already being investigated by the Competition Commission.
The airlines also called for Ruth Kelly, the transport secretary, to intervene to resolve the CAA's failings and 
demanded a moratorium on the price increases. The "failing finances" of BAA, which operates seven UK airports, 
should also be made public, they said.
The four airlines said the "dramatic" price rises at Heathrow and Gatwick showed the system was "broken and 
needs to be changed".
They complained the CAA was allowing charges at Heathrow to increase by 86 per cent from GBP10.36 to 
GBP19.31 per passenger during the next five years, while charges at Gatwick would rise by 49 per cent from 
GBP5.61 to GBP8.36.
BAA monopoly on airports under fire
The airlines said the increases would "inevitably hurt consumers".
Any rise in fares as a result of the higher charges is likely to be limited by competition between the airlines, 
however, and would be dwarfed by the impact of higher oil prices on airline finances and ticket prices.
The CAA said it was increasing the Heathrow price cap - the maximum fee the airport can charge the airlines - by 
GBP2.44, or 23.5 per cent in real terms, to GBP12.80 per passenger for the coming year from April 2008. Charges 
in the four subsequent years could rise 7.5 per cent a year above inflation.
Harry Bush, CAA group director for economic regulation, said improvements in airport facilities and service 
standards including GBP5bn of investment over the next five years and a halving of security queuing times "have to 
be paid for in increased charges". The outcome for passengers should be "decently modern airports and 
consistently high service standards".
Mr Bush maintained that the need for the capital investment - GBP4.79bn at Heathrow and GBP920m at Gatwick in 
the next five years - and increased spending on security had broadly been agreed between the airlines and the 
airports, but  the carriers were not happy to have to pay for the investment.
He revealed that BAA would be unable to meet its original aim of completing Heathrow East in time for the London 
Olympics in 2012. Phase one of the project, which is eventually to replace Terminals 1 and 2, would not be 
completed until the end of 2012, he said.
The CAA said it had toughened the standards of service BAA must meet at Heathrow and Gatwick and had more 
than doubled the maximum penalties it would incur for missing targets.
Mr Bush refuted claims by the airlines that the CAA had given in to BAA pressure by agreeing excessive charges to 
help finance debts loaded on to the company when it was acquired in 2006 in a highly leveraged take-over by a 
consortium led by Spain's Ferrovial.
Analysts have expressed fears about BAA's ability to finance investment commitments, but it said on Tuesday it 
remained committed to spending GBP4.8bn in the next five years on UK airports.

It's time for Cheltenham

Whatever the weather, spring will arrive at precisely 2pm next Tuesday in Gloucestershire. The helicopters of the 
rich will have clattered in over Cleeve Hill. Numb fingers will have wrestled with car-park hampers (surely only the 
British could picnic in March). The first of 170,000 pints of Guinness will have been sunk and revved-up younger 
jockeys, struggling into the tights they wear beneath their breeches, will be dreaming that this year they will ride 
their first winner at the Cheltenham Festival.
On breezy slopes, the spectators will open their lungs to roar off the start of the first race at the Festival. That  
tradition, invented by the crowd, encompasses a range of emotions: from the relief of the racing community that 
Cheltenham has come round again, after months of effort from trainers, work riders and stable staff to ensure their 
charges are at a peak of fitness; to the exhilaration of the crowd at the thought of what lies ahead: four days of 
drama, effort and excess that will test both wallets and livers.
There are no more thrilling sporting sights than a huge field tearing down the hill in the Triumph Hurdle, jostling for a 
gap at nearly 40 miles an hour, or the jockeys in the Queen Mother Champion Chase driving their mounts into the 
last fence, asking for one final effort as they seek momentum for the lung-draining climb back up to the finishing 
post. And all enveloped in a wall of partisan sound.
The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience 
caused.
But other courses have thrilling races, too. So what makes Cheltenham special? First, it is the assurance of quality, 
the knowledge that the best horses will be in competition with each other. "It is the Olympics of racing," says 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, who is both a racehorse owner and, through his company, a race sponsor 
It's time for Cheltenham
at the Festival. "You will see the best jumps horses from England, Ireland and France. You know that every  owner, 
trainer and jockey is busting a gut to win. There's that, a very challenging course and the carnival atmosphere."
There may be argument about what constitutes the greatest racing experience on the Flat. Royal Ascot, the Epsom 
Derby, its Kentucky equivalent, the Breeders' Cup series that moves around a cluster of US racetracks, and the 
richly endowed Dubai World Cup, which takes place at the end of this month: all have their supporters. Over 
obstacles, however, Cheltenham, where the Festival meeting includes the Gold Cup, the Champion Hurdle, the 
World Hurdle over three  miles, and the Queen Mother Champion Chase over the minimum distance of two miles, is 
acknowledged as the supreme event. Its only rival is Aintree's Grand National meeting and the National, though 
carrying a bigger prize, is a handicap  (where weights are adjusted according to ability, theoretically giving every 
horse an equal chance of winning) not a championship race at level weights.
If you grow up in a family with an interest in racing, says O'Leary, "there are two races you remember, the Grand 
National and the Cheltenham Gold Cup. To win either is a dream come true. Why? Because it's so bloody difficult." 
O'Leary's War of Attrition won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2006. At the time he declared: "I've died and gone to 
heaven."
Most spectators will have their own precious memory of a favourite contest, a winner heftily backed, a moment of 
glory etched on the inner eye for ever more. Perhaps the older ones were there for the epic Gold Cup contests in 
the 1960s between the incomparable Arkle and the brave Mill House; others for the popular grey Desert Orchid's 
triumph  in 1989 or for the third of Best Mate's big race victories in 2004, when he showed that he wasn't just an 
athlete blessed with a high cruising speed but a doughty battler too. And sometimes, the little man wins too. 
Regulars won't forget how Welsh farmer-trainer Sirrell Griffiths won the 1990 Gold Cup with the 100-1 shot Norton's 
Coin, having started the day by milking his herd of cows in Carmarthen. Legend too is the Irishman who won 
enough on Istabraq in the Champion Hurdle of 1998 to pay off his mortgage and then lost his house on Doran's 
Pride in the Gold Cup. "It was only a small house anyway," he is reputed to have said.
The gambling turnover is colossal at Cheltenham, and sets it apart from most other meetings. The on-course Tote, 
or bookmaker, is operated on a pool system according to the number of bets placed, and this alone takes upwards 
of GBP2.5m  a day throughout the Festival. Together with other on-course bookies, those who operate off-course 
and betting exchanges it is reckoned that about GBP400m is gambled over the four days.
In fact, says Edward Gillespie, Cheltenham's managing director, some spectators come just to watch the more 
fearless punters in action. "When people come for the first time they say they've never physically seen so much 
money change hands," he says. "In our daily lives we don't often see such handfuls of notes." These punters 
include the Geneva-based Irish financier and racehorse owner JP McManus, who has been known to wager more  
than GBP500,000 on a race.
Leading owner David Johnson recalls taking at least GBP500,000 out of the [bookies'] "ring" when Well  Chief won 
the Arkle Trophy at the Festival in 2004. "Everyone was on big time," he says. "We backed him down from 33-1 to 
12-1 and then we ran out of money."
Such bold betting is down to the strength of the market, explains Gillespie. "Put on several thousand pounds at  
Cheltenham and a bookie doesn't flinch." Certainly, if you tried that on the average racecourse on a mid-season 
Saturday, you'd be lucky if he allowed you GBP100 each way.
For the average Cheltenham spectator, however, a fiver or tenner each way brings much the same thrill. It is not 
betting for a life-changing gain but purchasing an interest in the race, a brief share in "ownership", the right to roar 
on a particular set of colours, and to celebrate the victory afterwards.
If the racing doesn't change, the same is not true of the audience. Cheltenham, where the Festival was properly  
established in 1911, when the National Hunt Chase permanently came to rest there, was never as smart as Ascot. 
It was essentially the preserve of the green-wellies set. The horse was king and fashion didn't intrude. But the 
growth of the sport's Anglo-Irish rivalry since the 1960s, and the spreading of wealth through society are among the 
It's time for Cheltenham
factors  that have attracted owners and spectators from a far wider sphere. One ex-military owner described last 
year's Cheltenham as "the best all-ranks event around".
It's still the case that if ever they need a preservation park for the trilby and the Barbour, Cheltenham will provide it. 
For these people, the festival is proof that the English countryside, which they fear is about to disappear, has 
survived another 12 months. However, the crowd is undeniably getting younger. There are more stretch limos 
rolling up alongside the four-wheel-drives; more sharper-suited young men from the City cutting deals in the 
hospitality boxes.  For Michael O'Leary this accessibility is part of the Festival's appeal. Unlike some of the grander 
Flat meetings, he says, Cheltenham "is culturally different, there's none of the pomposity of Ascot".
Of the Festival's daily audience of around 55,000 people, a quarter come from Gloucestershire and nearby, another 
quarter from London and the Home Counties. Of the rest, 10,000 come from Ireland, and proceed to take over 
much  of the Cotswolds countryside and its hostelries. Most of the top jockeys come from Ireland, too, including the 
irrepressible Paul Carberry. In hospital after a hunting accident before one recent Festival, Carberry was 
telephoned by trainer Noel Meade. "What did you break " asked the trainer anxiously. "A gate," replied the jockey.
With Irish trainers tending to see the racing almost as a team event, a friendly but intense Anglo-Irish rivalry has  
become one of the essential ingredients of Cheltenham. Two years ago the Irish were jubilant when they won 10 of 
the 24  Cheltenham Festival races. They have won seven of the past nine Champion Hurdles, and conditions have 
been swinging in their favour.
The best jumping or "National Hunt" horses (Cheltenham is not coy about maintaining the historic link with  hunting) 
are bred in Ireland. For decades the pick were sold on to English owners and breeders but, thanks to the recent 
boom in their economy, the Irish have been able to keep their best horses at home.
The Irish are among those who have taken the stretching of the festival since 2005, from three days to four to 
satisfy ticket demand, in their stride. They simply make a proper holiday of it. But some Cheltenham regulars, 
Edward Gillespie admits, have found it too much and started coming for only two days. With overall crowd figures 
up he is able  to take the positive: "It means that more people get the opportunity to attend. We are broadening our 
base." But it is no surprise the average age is dropping. It takes stamina to live with the collective passion of the 
true jumping enthusiasts and Cheltenham can be a tough way of enjoying a day out. The bars struggle to cope, 
there are long queues for the loos and the wind that comes off Cleeve Hill can cut to the bone.
More seriously, some trainers have complained that Cheltenham has become too dominant. Not only is a 
disproportionate stable effort geared to four days in March but owners all want to run at the Festival with horses that 
might finish third or fourth at Cheltenham but which could easily have won a GBP20,000 first prize at a lesser track 
another day.
Unfortunately for them, a Cheltenham Festival winner is what owning hurdlers and steeplechasers is all about. And 
nothing better sums up both this, and the Festival's widespread appeal, than the ownership of Denman, the second 
favourite for this year's Gold Cup. The two men who share him are Paul Barber and Harry Findlay. Barber, a dairy 
farmer in his 60s, lives next door to the training yard he leases to champion trainer Paul Nicholls in Somerset and is 
an old-school tweedy countryman. Canny but shy and understated, he can go years without a bet.
For Barber, with a Gold Cup and a Champion Chase already under his belt, it is all about the horse and he has an 
unerring eye for potential. Findlay, 48, is a brash professional gambler who spends his day at home near Bath in 
front of a computer and bank of televisions gambling on tennis and football as well as horseracing. Racing crowds 
love his unbridled enthusiasm and the way he conducts the applause for Denman, the burly horse he calls "The 
Tank".
What unites the odd couple is a passion for top-class steeplechasers. This promises to be a vintage year for them 
and for the crowd as Denman, unbeaten over fences and the winner of this year's Hennessy Gold Cup, for the first 
time takes on last year's Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, the athletic Kauto Star, owned by Clive Smith. It is set to be 
the duel of the decade and, remarkably, the two star chasers occupy adjoining stalls in Nicholls' yard. This really is  
going to be a championship of Olympic proportions.
It's time for Cheltenham
.........................................
Backing all the winners
Racing is one of the few sports where, if you are lucky, you can leave the premises with more money in your pocket 
than when you went in. It is also a sociable sport with time between the bursts of action for socialising and 
cementing  relationships or contacts.
The growing attendances at jump meetings have made the sport attractive to sponsors. Only football gets more 
spectators than racing over a year and only Wimbledon draws more than Cheltenham's 232,000 over four days.
Sponsorship has helped to boost prize money in jump racing from GBP26m in 2002 to GBP37m in 2006. At the 
Cheltenham Festival, the Gold Cup is now worth GBP450,000, with the races averaging prize money of 
GBP137,000. In spite of the risks of association with a sport that inevitably involves a number of equine and human 
casualties, Cheltenham attracts  a wide range of sponsors, a number of which are, unsurprisingly, Irish companies 
such as Smurfit Kappa, Anglo Irish Bank, Guinness and Ryanair, the Festival's "official airline".
Ryanair this year sees its sponsored race, the Ryanair Chase over 2 miles 5 furlongs, promoted to Grade One. The 
prize money has been raised, too, from GBP175,000 to GBP200,000. This may seem quite a price to pay but 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary sees the Festival as a natural fit. The Irish airline carries 12,000-15,000 
extra passengers thanks to Cheltenham and benefits from advance publicity for its race over a full six months. "In 
terms  of the mentions in newspapers and on TV," he says, "the sponsorship deal brings us GBP1m of publicity." 
Peter McNeile, Cheltenham's director of sponsorship, says that, unlike Epsom, Cheltenham does not seek an 
overall sponsor but finds sponsors for individual races. Perhaps aware of complaints that the Festival is coming to 
dominate the jumping season to the detriment of others, McNeile works with sponsors to leverage support across 
other meetings, too, and insists: "We go out of our way not to be a predator on other people's sponsors."

Inmarsat shrugged off concerns about an economic slowdown, but shares in the UK satellite communications 
company fell after its annual results disappointed some investors.
The company, which provides satellite telephony services to ships, aircraft and remote land locations, reported a 39  
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to $124.8m (GBP62.1m). But this fell short of heightened market expectations for 
the company, which has consistently outperformed forecasts since it listed three years ago.
Shares in the company fell 25p to 466p.
Analysts are concerned that the company faces higher capital expenditure costs this year, after bringing forward the  
launch of its next satellite to April. The launch adds an element of risk to the company.
Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive, said he had seen no slowdown in customer spending and expected the 
company to resist a downturn. A large proportion of its sales come from government and military clients.
He maintained the company's long-term forecast of 6 per cent to 8 per cent annual growth to 2010. Market 
expectations of 9 per cent revenue growth in 2008 were "challenging but achievable", he said.
Revenues for 2007 rose 15.3 per cent to $576.5m, as more ships bought its data services such as satellite internet 
connections. Shipping makes up about 55 per cent of sales and Inmarsat is selling more sophisticated services to 
the sector.
Inmarsat shrugs off blip in results
Aeronautical sales grew 44 per cent as private jets and government aircraft signed up for on-board internet. The 
company will benefit when airlines such as Ryanair start to offer inflight calls. These revenues are unlikely to be 
significant before next year.
Inmarsat also plans to launch globally a hand-held satellite phone at the end of this year. It will retail at about $500, 
half the current market price, and Inmarsat is hoping to have 10 per cent of that market by 2010.
Earnings per share fell from 28 cents to 21 cents. The final dividend is raised 8.3 per cent to 17.33 cents for a total 
of 28.88 cents (26.66 cents).

European equity markets moved higher on Wednesday, with gains across most sectors as investors sought 
bargains among  recently sold down stocks.
Meanwhile, Wall Street helped lighten the mood in Europe after it gained modestly in morning trade.
By the close, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was up 1.6 per cent to 1,300.98, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax added 2.1 per cent to 
6,683.71, the CAC 40 in Paris gained 1.7 per cent to 4,756.42 and London's FTSE 100 added 1.5 per cent to

Shares in Spanish power utility Iberdrola gained 3.5 per cent to 9.81 as rumours circulated the trading floors that  
French rival Electricite de France had bought a 6 per cent stake. EDF shares fell 0.6 per cent to 58.32.
Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, rose 4.8 per cent to 3.26 after reporting a 20 per cent rise in passenger traffic in 
February, from the same month a year ago.
Vallourec, the French steel tube maker, was the Eurofirst's biggest gainer, up 7.5 per cent to 146.22 thanks partly to 
an upgrade by broker Cheuvreux and following its results late on Tuesday. The company said it had a stable 
outlook for 2008 and planned cost cuts.
CNP Assurances, the French insurer, reported a 34.8 per cent rise in full-year net profit that met market 
expectations, and predicted further profit growth this year. CNP shares added 5.1 per cent to 74.37.
French bank Credit Agricole rose 5.8 per cent to 18.20 despite reporting its first quarterly loss since going public in 
2001. Meanwhile, its writedown of 3.3bn was larger than expected.

Jean-Pierre Lambert at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods said: "In our view, the bank took a positive step in disclosing 
the its notional exposure to monolines. Meanwhile, shareholders have the option to receive dividends in cash or 80 
per cent in shares, indicating the bank's efforts to preserve capital."
Germany's second-biggest listed lender Commerzbank was rumoured to be in talks with insurance group Signal-
Iduna about buying its 25 per cent stake in Essener National Bank, the regional lender. Commerzbank refused to 
comment, but the shares rose 3.7 per cent to 19.30.
Adidas, the German sportswear maker, reported a 63 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net profit. The shares, however, 
fell were up only 0.3 per cent to 41.58 as sales at its recently-acquired Reebok brand weakened.
Arkema, the chemicals group which was spun off from oil giant Total last year, rose 1.4 per cent to 36.25 after 
reporting a 26 per cent rise in full-year core profit and confirmed its financial targets for 2008. The company 
proposed a 0.75-a-share dividend.

Italy's highest administrative appeals court ruled on Monday that Alitalia's purchase in 2006 of Volare, a  low-cost 
airline, had been irregular and that the tender process should be repeated.
Industry analysts said the ruling by the Consiglio di Stato could complicate the takeover of Alitalia by Air France-
KLM which has until March 14 to make a binding offer for the loss-making airline, including the long-haul assets  of 
Volare.
The appeals court ruled in favour of Air One, a private Italian airline, which had bid unsuccessfully for Volare in 
2006 and for Alitalia in December 2007, Air One said. The court said parties had 30 days to submit new bids.
Volare, heavily in debt, declared insolvency in 2004 after its operations ground to a halt, stranding passengers in 
several countries. Alitalia bid 38m at a time when it was also losing money and had previously resorted to state aid 
to survive.
In November Ryanair filed a complaint against the European Commission over what it called unfair state aid to 
Alitalia and Volare.
Air One has separately appealed against a ruling by the Lazio regional administrative court that said Alitalia was in 
its rights to continue exclusive takeover talks with Air France-KLM.
Under Alitalia's slimmed-down summer 2008 plans, Volare, which has been rebranded as Volareweb, was to fly to 
23 destinations across Europe from Milan's Malpensa airport. Air Europe, which had been part of the Volare group 
in 2004, was to fly eight intercontinental routes, according to the new Alitalia plan that was announced on February 
5 to stave off bankruptcy.

EasyJet, the UK's leading low-cost airline, has maintained its forecast for a 20 per cent increase in underlying pre-
tax profits in its financial year to the end of September, in stark contrast to the profit warning issued this week  by 
rival Ryanair.
The Irish carrier, the largest no-frills airline in Europe measured by passenger numbers, had warned that higher oil  
prices, weakening consumer sentiment and the strong risk of recession could lead to a sharp decline in its profits in 
the year to March 2009 - possibly by as much as 50 per cent.
However, EasyJet said its total revenues per seat had risen "ahead of expectations" by 0.5 per cent in its  first 
quarter from October to December, helped by the strength of the euro and the introduction of charges for checked-
in baggage.
Revenues for the current second quarter were also expected "to continue to perform ahead of our original 
expectations", it said.
Forward bookings were "in line with expectations in spite of the uncertain macro- economic environment".
The carrier derives a significant proportion of its revenues in euros and the group said that most of its growth in 
passenger numbers in the first three months was achieved through its development of markets in continental 
Europe, in particular Italy, Spain and Switzerland.
As a result of the investment in these new operating bases total non-UK originating passengers increased 22 per 
cent  in the period. UK-originating passenger numbers rose just 5 per cent.
EasyJet sticks to profit forecast
The airline flew with slightly more empty seats in the first quarter from October to December, with a deterioration in 
the load factor year-on-year from 81.7 to 80.8 per cent.
The trend accelerated in January with a decline of 2.9 percentage points from 74.9 to 72 per cent.
However, EasyJet said its forward bookings for February and March showed "an improving trend" and it expected 
only a slight decline in loads for the second quarter, similar to the fall in the first three months. It has cut its lead-in 
fares to stimulate more traffic.
Rising ancillary revenues, including the baggage charges and commission earnings from areas such as hotel 
bookings, car hire and travel insurance, are driving the revenue performance.
While total revenues per seat rose 0.5 per cent in the first quarter, passenger revenues per seat fell 4 per cent due 
to weaker fare levels, but ancillary revenues per seat including bag charges jumped 42.6 per cent.
Overall in the first quarter turnover increased 14.1 per cent to GBP418m ($812m), passenger numbers rose 12.4 
per cent to 9.1m, while capacity measured by the number of seats rose 13.6 per cent.
EasyJet shares closed 4.91 per cent lower at 426p.

EasyJet, the leading UK low cost airline, maintained on Thursday its forecast for a 20 per cent increase in 
underlying pre-tax profits in its financial year to the end of September, in stark contrast to the profit warning issued

The Irish carrier, the largest no-frills airline in Europe measured by passenger numbers, had warned that higher oil  
prices, weakening consumer sentiment and the strong risk of recession could lead to a sharp decline in its profits in 
the year to March 2009 - possibly by as much as 50 per cent.
But EasyJet said in an interim management statement its total revenues per seat had risen "ahead of expectations"

Revenues for the current second quarter were also expected "to continue to perform ahead of our original

cent  to 9.1m, while capacity measured by the number of seats rose by 13.6 per cent.
EasyJet said that while its revenues would be ahead of its previous guidance, the impact was being largely offset by  
an increase in costs denominated in euros, principally airport costs, navigation and European-based crew costs.
Pre-tax profit margins in the first half of the financial year were forecast to decline by two to three percentage points, 
largely due to increased fuel costs. Unlike Ryanair, EasyJet has hedged part of its fuel requirements.
The airline completed the acquisition at the end of January of GB Airways, the Gatwick-based former franchise 
carrier of British Airways. It said the impact of the takeover was expected to be a pre-tax loss of GBP7m in the first 
half, but it would be earnings-enhancing on a full-year basis before integration costs of GBP12m incurred largely in 
the first half.
Difficulties in the credit markets had not affected the group's ability to raise finance for buying new aircraft. EasyJet 
said it had secured debt facilities for around $1bn at rates that compared favourably with existing debt financing.
The loans came from a group of banks including Alliance & Leicester, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, BNP Paribas, 
Commerzbank, Fortis, HSH Nordbank, ING, Natixis, SMBC and West LB.
They would be used to finance approximately 50 per cent of the airline's aircraft deliveries during the next three 
years.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, warned yesterday its profits could fall by as much as 50 per cent in its 
next financial year in the face of a "perfect storm" of rising oil prices, tougher economic conditions and falling fare 
levels.
Its share price fell more than 12 per cent in early trade but recovered to close eight cents, or 2.2 per cent, lower  at 
3.52.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the European airline sector was facing a cyclical downturn with the possibility 
of higher oil prices, poor consumer demand, weaker sterling and higher airport costs.
The Irish carrier, which has a record of issuing bearish forecasts, said it had virtually no hedging protection in place 
for its fuel requirements for the coming year to March 2009. Several analysts lowered their profit forecasts for next 
year.
Mr O'Leary said it was too early "in such volatile markets" to make any accurate forecasts for the next financial year 
but with oil prices at $90 a barrel and fear of recession in the UK and many other European economies, the current 
outlook for the coming year was "poor".
The group's "most optimistic" scenario was for a combination of flat yields (average fares) and crude  oil prices at 
$75, which would result in profits rising further next year by six per cent to approximately 500m (GBP375m).
However, if forward oil prices remained at $85, and consumer sentiment and sterling weakness led to a 5 per cent 
reduction in yields, profits in the coming year could fall by as much as 50 per cent to as low as 235m (excluding

profits from aircraft disposals). It would be only the second time the airline has suffered a fall in profits since flotation 
in 1997.
Ryanair's "only one competitive response to any consumer uncertainty" would be to intensify a price war, said Mr 
O'Leary, with moves "to slash fares and yields, stimulate traffic, encourage price-sensitive consumers and promote 
new routes and base developments."
It repeated its previous guidance for the full year to March 2008 for a 17.5 per cent increase in net profits to 
approximately 470m. Pre-tax profits in the first nine months from April to December rose 20.5 per cent from 423.4m 
to  510m, while net profits increase 20.6 per cent to 454.8m. In the third quarter, underlying profits fell 10 per cent 
excluding aircraft sales.

In all the talk about its massive subprime losses, the impact of UBS's abysmal 2007 on the poor Swiss taxpayer has 
gone rather unnoticed. The former financial powerhouse paid about 60 per cent of its almost SFr3bn in taxes in 
2006  in Switzerland - hardly peanuts for a country of just 7.5m people. And that excludes the tax withheld on 
dividend payments to shareholders.
UBS is declining to comment on what its estimated SFr4.4bn loss for 2007 means for its taxman. But Observer has 
already gleaned that beancounters from Glarus to Geneva are bracing themselves for the consequences.
Just how big the impact will be is hard to judge. Swiss companies pay tax at federal, cantonal and local levels. 
Moreover, the bank has its legal base in Basel as well as Zurich - harking back to the founding 1997 merger of 
Basel-based Swiss Bank Corporation and Zurich-headquartered Union Bank of Switzerland. Then there are the 
myriad foreign jurisdictions where the group makes money - all of which presumably would normally get their piece 
of the action.
But one man has been preparing the ground. Hans-Rudolf Merz, Switzerland's finance minister, has warned of 
shortfalls of "many hundreds of millions, up to a billion" Swiss francs this year. Luckily for Merz, the thriving 
economy (including buoyant earnings from all those other banks) should keep the tills ringing, with or without  UBS.
Carla's cachet
Newlyweds Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni have endured their first major test as a couple, and they have passed.
Sarkozy, the French president, and Bruni won their case against Ryanair for using their picture in an advertisement 
without permission.
US housing woes bite Swiss taxpayers
Ryanair, sensing a good publicity moment, ran the cheeky advert in a French newspaper featuring the couple, with 
a bubble appearing from the former model's mouth: "With Ryanair, now my whole family can come to my wedding."
Bruni had asked a court for 500,000, saying this is what she typically earns for appearing in an advertisement. But  
the Paris court awarded her only 60,000. Sarkozy was given the symbolic 1 that he had sought.
Does the court's judgment say something about the relative value of the image of a president's wife to that of a 
fashion model?
Or did the court simply find some sympathy with Ryanair, which apologised before the case went to court?
In any case, Ryanair was also ordered to publish its verdict in the newspaper that carried the offending advert.
The publicity-savvy low-cost airline would be wise to play it straight down the middle this time.
Unvarnished truth
Samak Sundaravej, Thailand's new prime minister, campaigned on a pledge to restore the can-do spirit of the 
energetic and upbeat Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister ousted in a 2006 military coup. But Samak, a 
72-year-old political veteran, is far from the accomplished spin-meister of his exiled predecessor.
The process of forming a cabinet has dragged on amid jockeying for posts by various members of the five-party 
coalition led by Samak's People's Power party. And in spite of the time it has taken to settle on the line-up, Samak 
has made it clear that he is less than thrilled with the result. The cabinet is due to be publicly unveiled on 
Wednesday, after the proposed appointments receive the assent of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. But Samak has 
already grumbled that he was unable to find competent outsiders willing to join the team, resulting in what he has 
described as an "ugly duckling" cabinet.
It's far from the kind of relentless brave face that the Thai public expected from slick Thaksin, a master of marketing 
and self-promotion. Clearly Samak has a lot to learn to fill those shoes.
Lesson learnt
Carefully timing foreign trips can mean the difference for researchers between really getting under the skin of a 
place and returning having barely scratched the surface.
So how would Jim Walker, the former head economist at CLSA and now an independent consultant, rate his timing 
after he got stuck in traffic for nine hours in Jakarta last Friday? Walker's trip to the Indonesian capital's airport was 
slowed by the metre-deep floods that, sadly, killed three people and forced 100,000 to evacuate their homes.
From a note to clients, it is hard to tell. The first paragraph sounds like his ordeal provided him with exactly what he 
was looking for.
"Today's traffic problems are an apt metaphor for Indonesia: stuck in first gear with long periods of sitting around 
waiting for the jam to clear. The country is stuck with lousy leadership, weak institutions and below potential 
growth."
But by the end of the very bearish missive he had clearly decided he did not need such first-hand experiences. For 
it ended: "Memo to self: do not visit Jakarta in the rainy season again. Off to bed now."
Busy day
As voters in 20 US states took to the booths and Mardi Gras parades rolled into New Orleans on Tuesday, New 
York held its first ticker-tape parade since 2000. The occasion was the New York Giants' defeat of the New England 
Patriots in Sunday's Super Bowl. It all left New Yorkers scrambling to vote in the primary, navigate through parade 
traffic  on Broadway and still get some work done. Not easy.

Ryanair has a long tradition of ominous prognostications which fail to be fulfilled. On Monday Europe's largest  low-
cost airline announced below-consensus third-quarter results, and gave a particularly pessimistic forecast of things 
to come. Is the gloom, for once, justified?
UK airlines, according to Ryanair, face a "perfect storm" of high oil prices, slowing consumer demand and sterling 
weakness. If forward oil prices remain at $85 a barrel, and average fares fall 5 per cent, the airline says next 
financial year's profits could be halved. Ryanair's lack of cheer is shared by the industry body, IATA, which recently 
lowered its industry profit forecast for 2008 from $7.8bn to $5,bn albeit with US airlines bearing the brunt.
European airlines, though, cannot just blame a deteriorating external environment. Despite ferocious competition, 
all are increasing short-haul capacity, with Ryanair itself leading the pack. Although passenger numbers have, so 
far, held  up well, signs of strain are appearing. Air Berlin, Spain's Vueling and SAS have all either delayed or 
cancelled orders, or handed back leased planes early, according to Morgan Stanley, and ailing Alitalia may scale 
down its operations. Indeed, the sufferings of weaker competitors could help Ryanair if they result in capacity being 
reined back. And it has other cushions - ancillary revenues, for example from car hire, are growing fast.
Ryanair's verbal gloom is not backed up by its actions. It is planning a new share buyback programme despite 
having net debt - if only to the tune of 18m - for the first time in its eleven-year history as a listed company. During 
the last downturn following 9/11, Ryanair was able to use its muscle to extract favourable deals from squeezed 
suppliers. Investors have good reason to hope that, this time round, its rhetoric is once again not matched by reality

European alternative energy stocks got a welcome boost on Monday after Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems raised 
its  outlook for 2007 sales and profit margins.
Vestas, the world's biggest wind turbine manufacturer, surged 7.7 per cent to DKr536 after it said strong sales  
development in the fourth quarter had prompted it to raise its revenue estimate to 4.85bn from a previous 4.5bn.
Renewable energy stocks, which have fallen sharply in recent weeks, rallied across the board on speculation that 
the  sector had reached a bottom.
Torben Sommer, an alternative energy analyst at Piper Jaffray, said: "Almost all the renewable energy sector was 
oversold quite aggressively over the past four weeks,". He said bid speculation was also helping stocks bounce 
back.
The buzz in Spain was that energy group Iberdrola could mount a takeover of Gamesa or Solaria, the renewable 
energy companies, in a bid to shore up its position against a hostile approach. Solaria, which specialises in solar 
panels, gained 8.3 per cent to 17.41, and Gamesa, which makes both turbines and solar panels, rose 3.5 per cent 
to 27.42.
EDF, the French utility group that together with Spanish construction group ACS has been considering a takeover 
of Iberdrola, fell 1.6 per cent to 67.87. Iberdrola retreated 1.4 per cent to 10.22.
Solar panel groups benefited from expectations that demand for renewable energy would rise on the back of higher 
oil  prices and amid mounting concerns about greenhouse gas emissions. Norway's Renewable Energy Corp rose 
4.1 per cent  to NKr145.75, while Germany's Q-Cells added 2.4 per cent to 65.50.
European shares lifted by alternative energy
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended the day 0.2 per cent higher at 1,356.20, having slipped from its highs after US stock 
markets opened lower. Frankfurt's Xetra Dax rose 0.5 per cent to 7,000.49, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.1 per 
cent to 4,973.64.
France's biggest faller was Societe Generale, which dropped 4.8 per cent to 83.61 amid expectations of a 
discounted rights issue later in the week.
Ryanair , the Irish budget airline, fell 2.2 per cent to 3.52 after it reported a 27 per cent fall in third-quarter  net profit 
and warned of weaker profit next year.
"The European airline sector is presently facing a cyclical downturn," the company said, warning of high fuel costs, 
poor consumer demand and weaker sterling.
Other budget airline groups suffered. Air Berlin fell 2.5 per cent to 11.27, and Spain's Vueling Airlines shed  0.1 per 
cent to 9.19.
Alitalia rose 4.8 per cent to 0.69 after smaller Italian airline Air One said it was preparing a bid with other Italian 
investors for the struggling carrier. Air France-KLM, which is currently in talks with Alitalia, closed 0.1 per  cent 
higher at 19.01.
German steelmaker Salzgitter rose 4 per cent to 115.50 after Credit Suisse lifted its price target to 189 from 150 
and kept its "outperform" rating.
The broker said:"We believe Salzgitter is a very cheap stock in a very strong global steel market and is a strong 
play on the risk of a global steel shortage."
Shares in Inmobiliaria Colonial jumped 8.4 per cent to 1.67 after the Investment Corporation of Dubai said the main  
two shareholders in the Spanish property firm had agreed to sell if the Dubai fund launched a takeover bid.
Real estate peers were also strong, with Astroc rising 0.63 per cent to 3.68, and Renta Corp ticking up 1.2 per cent 
to 13.50.

CAA plans Stansted price shake-up

Body
The Civil Aviation Authority is proposing radical reforms to the price control regime for London Stansted airport 
following the embarrassing rebuff by ministers of its original plan to remove the airport entirely from price regulation.
Ruth Kelly, transport secretary, last week rejected analysis from the CAA, official adviser to the government on 
aviation issues, that claimed that Stansted airport no longer had the monopoly power to justify a regime of price 
regulation.
Defiantly challenging the transport department's conclusions, the CAA sought on Friday to assert its role as the 
UK's "independent" aviation regulator.
It repeated that its analysis indicated that Stansted, the third largest UK airport, did "not currently enjoy a  
sufficiently strong market position that would normally be associated with the need to apply price caps."
It said, "there is some uncertainty about how this position might change. The conclusions drawn by the government 
and the CAA from the available evidence differ. The government considers that it is more likely than not that 
Stansted will acquire substantial market power in the future, while the CAA considers that the airport is not likely to  
do so."
It said its own analysis indicated that even if Stansted's market position were to strengthen, competition law would 
constrain its conduct and mitigate the risk that airport users could be subject to market abuse.
The CAA openly rejected Ms Kelly's recent assertion that continuing price controls were needed at Stansted to 
protect consumers.
CAA plans Stansted price shake-up
It said that previous price caps at Stansted had not had a significant impact on the prices actually charged by the 
airport or its investment in capacity and service. Normal commercial and competitive pressures had protected 
passengers  and airlines, it said.
The CAA said the traditional approach to setting price caps could "distort investment decisions and undermine the 
development of a competitive airports market."
The government was subject to fierce lobbying by airlines over the CAA proposal to remove price controls at 
Stansted, in particular from Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading operators at Stansted, which have attacked the CAA's 
performance as economic regulator.
The CAA said on Friday that under the current price cap regime airlines using the airport might face incentives to 
oppose efficient investment in additional capacity, in order to reduce the airport's costs and lower the level of the 
price cap.
BAA, the owner of Stansted, is expected to apply soon for planning permission to build a highly controversial 
second  runway and terminal at Stansted, doubling capacity, a move strongly supported by the government but 
fiercely opposed by  local authorities and environmental and residents' groups.
Bowing to ministers' insistence that there should be continuing price caps, the CAA put forward proposals on Friday 
for consultation on various regimes, but said they should provide "a backstop protection to users" without "intrusive" 
regulation.
Defying the recent government view, the CAA said there was "strong evidence" that Stansted faced "material 
competitive constraints" from a number of other (non-BAA) airports including Birmingham, East Midlands and 
Luton.
It put forward on Friday its preferred proposals for either market-led or precautionary price caps, which could 
increase charges to airlines to between GBP8.50 ($16.80) and GBP12.50 per passenger from the current level of 
GBP5.50 in 2007/08. Actual charges would probably fall below the price caps.
Other options could include putting the development of additional terminal capacity and related facilities out to 
competitive tender, or only setting a price cap on existing airport assets with new investment left outside the regime.
The CAA said the new regime should come into force in April 2009. There would be two months for public 
consultations  and it would refer the issue to the Competition Commission at the end of April.

The Civil Aviation Authority is proposing radical reforms to the price control regime for London Stansted airport 
following the embarrassing rebuff by ministers of its original plan to remove the airport entirely from price regulation.
Ruth Kelly, transport secretary, last week rejected analysis from the CAA, official adviser to the government on 
aviation issues, that claimed that Stansted airport no longer had the monopoly power to justify a regime of price 
regulation.
Defiantly challenging the transport department's conclusions, the CAA sought on Friday to assert its role as the 
UK's "independent" aviation regulator.
It repeated that its analysis indicated that Stansted, the third largest UK airport, did "not currently enjoy a  
sufficiently strong market position that would normally be associated with the need to apply price caps."
It said, "there is some uncertainty about how this position might change. The conclusions drawn by the government 
and the CAA from the available evidence differ. The government considers that it is more likely than not that 
Stansted will acquire substantial market power in the future, while the CAA considers that the airport is not likely to  
do so."
It said its own analysis indicated that even if Stansted's market position were to strengthen, competition law would 
constrain its conduct and mitigate the risk that airport users could be subject to market abuse.
The CAA openly rejected Ms Kelly's recent assertion that continuing price controls were needed at Stansted to 
protect consumers.
CAA proposes price control reforms for Stanstead
It said that previous price caps at Stansted had not had a significant impact on the prices actually charged by the 
airport or its investment in capacity and service. Normal commercial and competitive pressures had protected 
passengers  and airlines, it said.
The CAA said the traditional approach to setting price caps could "distort investment decisions and undermine the 
development of a competitive airports market."
The government was subject to fierce lobbying by airlines over the CAA proposal to remove price controls at 
Stansted, in particular from Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading operators at Stansted, which have attacked the CAA's 
performance as economic regulator.
The CAA said on Friday that under the current price cap regime airlines using the airport might face incentives to 
oppose efficient investment in additional capacity, in order to reduce the airport's costs and lower the level of the 
price cap.
BAA, the owner of Stansted, is expected to apply soon for planning permission to build a highly controversial 
second  runway and terminal at Stansted, doubling capacity, a move strongly supported by the government but 
fiercely opposed by  local authorities and environmental and residents' groups.

The Power of Unreasonable People: How Social Entrepreneurs Create Markets that Change the World GameBy 
John Elkington and Pamela HartiganHarvard Business School Press, $27.50, GBP15.99
The advancement of the human race depends on unreasonable people, the playwright George Bernard Shaw said 
in his Maxims for Revolutionists at the end of Man and Superman: "The reasonable man adapts himself to the 
world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the 
unreasonable man."
Entrepreneurs have often been seen by their contemporaries as unreasonable. Think of Henry Ford, paying 
workers twice the going rate to mass produce identical black cars by the million. Or the pioneers behind low-cost 
airlines such as Southwest Airlines and Ryanair who launched discount flights with none of the frills offered by 
traditional carriers. Or Sir James Dyson, inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, who had to create his own 
company to make it.
John Elkington, founder of UK-based think-tank SustainAbility, and Pamela Hartigan of the Schwab Foundation for 
Social Entrepreneurship, argue that humankind's future now depends on one particular new group of unreasonable 
people. They are the social entrepreneurs striving to solve the knotty economic, social and environmental problems 
facing the modern world.
These pioneers are "disrupting existing industries, value chains and business models" to find solutions to  poverty 
and hunger, the threat of global pandemics and climate change. More important for Financial Times readers, their 
skills must be harnessed by conventional businesses if they are to adapt to the risks and opportunities that now 
face the world.
Changing the market system
This is not often easy, precisely because such people are, well, unreasonable. They are usually impatient with 
bureaucracies and prepared to take big risks to tackle seemingly intractable problems. Their goals of sustainable 
development and social justice appear to challenge existing ways of doing business. Their solutions are often small-
scale, tailor-made and dependent on informal networks alien to the modern corporation.
Yet the most successful, identified in this book, have changed for the better the lives of hundreds of thousands or 
even millions of people.
One of the best-known is Muhammed Yunus, the Nobel prize-winning founder of Grameen Bank, which pioneered 
microfinance and inspired imitators around the world. He has now created new businesses, such as 
Grameenphone, which built the largest cellular network in Bangladesh with the Village Phone Program to provide 
access to telecommunications  in the countryside.
Victoria Hale's OneWorld Health develops new drugs for diseases that affect the world's poorest people, such as 
leishmaniasis. David Green's Aurolab has become one of the largest manufacturers of eye lenses used to deal with 
cataracts, selling for less than $4 lenses that would cost $150 in developed countries. Nicholas Negroponte of 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology is behind a $100 laptop that would be affordable for the poorest young 
people on the globe.
Many big companies have already grasped the environmental and social challenge. Large banks such as HSBC, 
Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are among those working to reduce their carbon footprints and finance new 
technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Retailers such as Wal-Mart of the US and the UK's Marks & 
Spencer are working with suppliers to ensure products are made ethically and with less environmental impact.
But few have so far addressed the greatest opportunities that lie among the 4bn people who live on less than $2 a 
day - the so-called "base of the pyramid". Their purchasing power is $5,000bn a year according to the International 
Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank. And there is money to be made in meeting their 
needs - something the most successful social entrepreneurs emphasise in seeking resources to scale up 
operations.
The aim of this book is to help conventional businesses work with those entrepreneurs and to learn from the way 
they  work.
The authors are notable in seeing no clash between the ends social entrepreneurs are seeking to achieve and the 
market system.
As a book, it is far from satisfactory. Written in the leaden style of many US business magazines, it cries out for 
more colourful accounts of the heroes it writes about and how they overcame obstacles. It also mixes true 
entrepreneurs  such as those above with campaigners such as Peter Eigen of Transparency International and Bob 
Massie, who launched the  Global Reporting Initiative. The latter have made an impact through their ingenuity and 
single-mindedness, but can hardly be described as entrepreneurs.
Yet there is no doubting the validity of the message. An increasingly crowded world is full of danger and challenges. 
The market system can solve those problems far more effectively than government action - provided the 
businesses that operate within it learn from these unreasonable people.

Shannon opens up to Paris

Shannon Airport in south-west Ireland is preparing to open a new international connection to Paris in the wake of 
the row over Aer Lingus' decision to end its service to Heathrow, the centrepiece of the airport's operations for  
close on 50 years.
CityJet - owned by Air France - will from February 4 fly to Paris Charles de Gaulle, providing some relief for those  
foreign and local businesses in the Shannon area left marooned when Aer Lingus ended its Heathrow service last 
August, using the valuable landing slots it owns at the UK airport to service a new Northern Ireland route to Belfast.
Last Monday, Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus chief executive, was in Belfast to oversee the first flight out.
However, the day before, Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, was on hand in a local Munster rugby jersey 
at Shannon as the last Aer Lingus flight departed, offering all those flying free tickets to fly to London with his airline.
The rivalry between the two Irish airlines has intensified since Ryanair made an unsuccessful bid for Aer Lingus in 
October 2006, launching a daring dawn raid on the shares shortly after the former state owned carrier was part 
privatised. The government owns 25 per cent, but Ryanair is now the largest single shareholder with just less than 
30 per cent.
Ryanair, rarely a champion of a state-owned airport, was highly critical of Aer Lingus' move to Belfast and tried to 
convene an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to question the strategy. The decision was a particular blow for 
Shannon, which is already set to lose business with the advent of the open skies agreement between the European 
Union and the US, which takes effect from April.
Shannon opens up to Paris
Shannon has been largely developed on the back of a bilateral deal between the US and Ireland, under which 
every other transatlantic flight from the US to Ireland was required to stop there. From November, that has been 
phased out with just one in three flights now landing at Shannon and from April there will be no obligation on US 
flights to do so.
Shannon also claims to be the first place to operate duty-free shopping, back in 1947. But that too has been hit by 
the European Commission scrapping duty-free sales within the EU.
In the past few years the airport has enjoyed some revenue relief from the use of Shannon by US army flights 
transiting soldiers and equipment to the Gulf - although, with the Republic of Ireland traditionally a neutral country,  
this is not something the state owned airport has been keen to highlight.

Kelly overrules CAA on Stansted airline levy

Ruth Kelly, transport secretary, on Tuesday rejected the advice of the Civil Aviation Authority by deciding to mantain 
the cap on charges levied on airlines for using London Stansted airport.
In a serious blow to the image of the independent regulator, Ms Kelly said the maximum level of Stansted's charges 
must still be set by the CAA as the "best way of protecting passengers who use the airport". However,  price 
controls at Manchester Airport are to be lifted.
Heathrow and Gatwick are also price-controlled and no change has been proposed.
There is unlikely to be any immediate impact on passengers flying to and from Stansted, as in practice the airport 
does not charge at the ceiling level.
At Manchester, where price controls are to end, Jonathan Bailey, director of external affairs at Manchester Airports  
group, said for consumers "it will not make a massive difference to pricing. We already price to the market, but it will 
be up to the airlines to pass on any saving."
But airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet have argued that Stansted, owned by BAA, would be able to abuse its 
monopoly position if it were not price-regulated, forcing up charges and ultimately ticket prices.
The CAA called on the government last summer to end the regime of regulated price controls for both London 
Stansted and Manchester, the third and fourth largest UK airports, in what would have been the biggest shake-up 
since the system  was introduced after the privatisation of BAA, the UK airports group, in 1987.
Kelly overrules CAA on Stansted airline levy
To date the CAA has regulated the charges imposed on airlines at four UK airports, the three London airports at 
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, all owned by BAA, and Manchester Airport, which is owned by 10 local authorities 
led by  Manchester City Council.
The CAA said last year that Stansted did not have and was not likely to acquire "substantial market power". 
Competition law was sufficient to address the risk of abuse, while continuing regulation ran the danger of 
distortingdecisions to be taken on the timing and scope of increasing capacity at Stansted, including the building of 
a  second runway.
The CAA also claimed that Manchester Airport faced stiff competition, with strong route overlaps in particular with 
Liverpool and Leeds-Bradford airports. It said last year that competitive pressures limited any incentive for 
Manchester to raise prices "unreasonably".
In rebuffing the CAA advice on Stansted, Ms Kelly said she had "taken into consideration . . . that the airports in the 
South East are now operating at almost full capacity. This is bad for passengers in terms of delays, congestion and 
lack of choice and it is also bad for the UK's productivity and growth."
The government supported the building of a second runway at Stansted, she said, and was in the midst of a public 
consultation on a third runway and sixth terminal at Heathrow. "Until [then] . . . the CAA plays an important role  in 
protecting passengers."
The CAA should continue to set price caps at Stansted until new capacity was delivered, or further evidence 
emerged from an investigation into the structure of BAA by the Competition Commission, which has the power to 
recommend the break-up of the BAA London airport monopoly, as urged by several leading airlines.
In a pointed response, the CAA said there were "differences between the government's analysis of competitive 
conditions in the market in which Stansted operates" and its own.

Price controls to stay at Stansted

London Stansted airport is to remain subject to price controls despite a recommendation from the Civil Aviation 
Authority, the government's official adviser on aviation, to free the airport to negotiate charges freely with the  
airlines.
Price controls at Manchester airport are to be ended, however, the department for transport said on Tuesday.
The decision on Stansted is a blow to the CAA. Ruth Kelly, transport secretary, rejected its advice to end price 
controls, saying the authority would continue to set the maximum level of charges as the "best way of protecting 
passengers".
But the move is a significant victory for Ryanair and EasyJet, the Irish and UK low cost airlines, the main carriers  
using Stansted, which together account for around 85 per cent of the airport's passenger volumes.
EasyJet welcomed the move. Andrew Barker, the airline's planning director, said in a statement: "Ruth Kelly and the 
department for transport officials should be congratulated for protecting air travellers from BAA ripping-off airlines at 
Stansted. They recognise that, without regulation, customers would be at the mercy of a highly-indebted 
infrastructure owner seeking short-term profit maximisation at the expense of air traveller."
The CAA has come under heavy attack from airlines for its economic regulation of BAA's three London airports, 
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
It called on the government last summer to end the present regime of regulated price controls for both Stansted and 
Manchester, the third and fourth largest UK airports. That would have represented the biggest shake-up of the 
Price controls to stay at Stansted
economic regulation of UK airports since the system was introduced in response to the privatisation of BAA, the UK 
airports group, in 1987.
The CAA currently regulates charges imposed on airlines at four UK airports: the three London airports, which are 
all owned by BAA, and Manchester, which is owned by 10 local authorities led by Manchester City Council.
It said last year that Stansted did not have and was not likely to acquire "substantial market power".
Competition law was sufficient to address the risk of abuse, while continuing regulation ran the danger of distorting 
the big decisions to be taken on the timing and scope of increasing capacity at Stansted, including the building of a 
second runway.
The CAA also claimed that Manchester airport faced strong competition in some of its local markets, with strong 
route overlaps in particular with Liverpool and Leeds-Bradford airports. It said last year that competitive pressures 
limited  any incentive for Manchester to raise prices "unreasonably".
In rebuffing the CAA's advice on Stansted, Ms Kelly said she had "taken into consideration the fact that the airports 
in the south-east are now operating at almost full capacity. This is bad for passengers in terms of delays, 
congestion and lack of choice and it is also bad for the UK's productivity and growth."
The government supported the building of a second runway at Stansted, she said, and was also in the midst of a 
public consultation on adding capacity with a third runway and sixth terminal at Heathrow.
"Until this new capacity can be delivered, the CAA plays an important role in protecting passengers," she said.
By contrast, Ms Kelly said Manchester should be freed from price controls because "other local airports, such as 
Liverpool, offer real choice for passengers."
There would be spare capacity at Manchester and competing airports "for the foreseeable future, even allowing for 
expected growth in demand," she said.
The decision to "de-designate" Manchester would enable the airport to grow and develop "without the costs of 
excessive regulation falling to passengers in the future."
BAA said: "While BAA maintains its position in favour of de-designating Stansted, we welcome the secretary of 
state's statement that the key issue facing our airports in the south-east of England is lack of capacity; as well  as 
her renewed support both for a second runway at Stansted, and to consulting on a third runway at Heathrow."
The airports operator is owned by Ferrovial, the Spanish construction, infrastructure and services group.

Stansted surprise puts more pressure on BAA

If BAA is the tall man crammed into economy, Ruth Kelly is the passenger in front who, without warning, ratchets 
her  seat back on to his knees.
The airports owner and Ferrovial, its owner, are already squeezed by regulatory conditions tighter than the Spanish 
infrastructure group expected when it led BAA's leveraged buy-out in 2006. They had hoped the transport secretary 
would agree with the Civil Aviation Authority that there was no longer a need to cap prices at Stansted, the smallest 
of BAA's three London airports. Instead, she disagreed.
BAA made the best of Ms Kelly's unexpected decision. At least, it said, she reiterated the government's 
commitment to more runways at Stansted and at Heathrow. But with credit markets as clogged as a departure 
lounge on a foggy Christmas Eve, that is cold comfort for the airports group and its owner. The Spanish group still 
wants to securitise some GBP10bn of new and assumed debt that was the legacy of the acquisition. It has delayed 
the refinancing while it waits for a pricing regime for Heathrow and Gatwick to be finalised.
Airlines - particularly the low-fare, short-haul specialists such as Ryanair and EasyJet - were, unsurprisingly, cock-
a-hoop. They should be. The regulator had based its recommendation, in part, on the observation that if BAA could 
not set prices at the highest level possible under a regulated system, the free market must be working. As if to rub 
in  its victory, Ryanair yesterday opened a new base at Birmingham airport - which is close enough to draw custom 
away from  Stansted, according to the CAA analysis rejected by the government. The regulator now has the tough 
task of coming up with a price cap for Stansted that is flexible enough to make it worthwhile for BAA to add extra 
capacity.
Stansted surprise puts more pressure on BAA
It is hard to shed tears for Ferrovial, an infrastructure expert that went into the BAA deal with its eyes open. Its  UK 
airports remain plagued by delays and congestion. But the sort of uncertainty sown by yesterday's decision will  
only make it harder to alleviate BAA's debt burden.
When to be less prudent
It was brave of Sir Howard Davies to put his head above the Northern Rock parapet, on Tuesday of all days. The 
former chairman of the Financial Services Authority used a speech in Oxford on the future of financial regulation to 
defend the tripartite agreement that he co-authored. It would have been easy for him to stay mum and let Gordon 
Brown continue to reap the blame for the fateful memorandum. Instead, Sir Howard says that while politico-
regulatory judgments about the Rock may have been flawed, the structural arrangement is fine and Alistair Darling 
is right to reject fundamental reform. That seems correct. The memorandum itself (which, let's face it, few of us 
knew about, let alone had read,  before it was called into question) is clear enough about the responsibilities of the 
FSA, Bank of England and Treasury. But it was drafted to counter pre-1997 fears - such as the possibility that the 
Bank would grant support for an ailing institution too easily and need reining in by the Treasury. In the case of 
Northern Rock, it was the chancellor who felt he lacked authority to push through support for the stricken lender.
Still, granting new powers to the FSA and the Treasury is risky. As this column pointed out last week, if martial law 
were imposed in a financial crisis, the rights of (among others) shareholders could be sacrificed. Faced with such a 
threat, however remote, Sir Howard says it would be logical for banks to decide simply to swathe themselves in 
capital.  That would be "good for stability, but expensive for customers". The former FSA chairman has devised a 
fine oxymoron to describe this undesirable situation - reckless prudence.
Food, inflationary food
Who has been left holding the food-inflation baby? Not Northern Foods, if Tuesday's third-quarter trading statement 
is to be believed. The Christmas-pudding-to-pizza producer's 3.5 per cent increase in revenue can be attributed to 
price increases, but it says it managed to pass those on to retailers. Not Uniq, which said it had renegotiated prices 
with UK stores, passing on the higher cost of dairy and wheat ingredients in its convenience foods.  Not J Sainsbury 
and Tesco, both of which say claims of food price inflation have been overdone. Not shoppers, for whom 
competition compresses prices.
These seemingly contradictory noises-off are best interpreted as preparations for war. The supermarkets would like 
the Bank of England to agree with their message and cut interest rates. But they also need to bang the low-price 
drum to send a clear message to suppliers that they will not cave in during annual negotiations over price 
increases.
Official figures, though, still show that producers have raised food prices by 7.4 per cent over the past year. That  
increase fed into consumer price inflation for December, even if other factors kept the headline figure steady. This 
must be hurting somebody. Only more detailed comparison of food retailers' and food producers' margins, when 
they choose to reveal them, will allow us to work out precisely whom.

Sterling fell to an 11-year low against European currencies yesterday after worse than expected Christmas trading 
data from Marks and Spencer fuelled fears for the health of the economy and raised pressure on the Bank of 
England to cut interest rates today.
M&S, the nation's biggest clothing chain, reported underlying sales 2.2 per cent down between October and 
December compared with 2006, ending nine quarters of consecutive growth.
As a bellwether for companies whose fortunes are linked to consumer spending, its trading statement had an 
immediate  and adverse impact on retail, airline and travel company shares.
The FTSE 100 index fell 1.3 per cent on the day to 6,272.7 points, with retail shares having their worst day for 20 
years, dropping 9.6 per cent. Airline shares were hard hit with EasyJet's share price tumbling 7.9 per cent after a 
fall of 13.9 per cent on Tuesday.
Tui Travel fell 14 per cent, Ryanair 8.1 per cent and Air France-KLM 5.8 per cent. The figures prompted Sir Stuart 
Rose, chief executive of M&S, to call for a swift cut in interest rates.
"We need an interest rate reduction," he said. "It is the toughest [trading conditions] I have seen in a decade . . . 
This is not a banana republic, this is Great Britain. But clearly people are very worried."
His comments came the day after Alistair Darling broke the long-standing convention not to put political pressure on  
the Bank of England over interest rates, arguing it had "room for manoeuvre" on monetary policy.
Retail currency markets
The chancellor's words brought condemnation from economists keen to preserve the independence of the Bank's 
monetary policy committee. Professor Willem Buiter, of the London School of Economics, a former MPC member, 
said Mr Darling should "learn and practise the art of silence" when it comes to rates decisions as it is "undermining 
one of the crowning achievements of the Blair-Brown years".
The bad news from M&S fed investors' expectations of a rate cut. Although most economists still expect the Bank to 
keep rates at 5.5 per cent, many said a cut would now not surprise them. Futures markets bet that it was more likely 
than not that the MPC would cut rates.
The MPC's deliberations over rate cuts have been complicated by the decline of sterling over the past month as a 
weaker currency will stimulate the economy and feed into higher import prices. Sterling dropped 0.5 per cent 
against the euro yesterday, leaving it at its lowest ever level against the euro - created in 1999 - and its weakest 
level against European currencies since the end of 1996. It fell 0.7 per cent versus the dollar to $1.9575, its lowest 
point in nine months.
Since peaking against the dollar above $2.11 in November, the pound has fallen more than 7 per cent and against 
the euro has dropped 6.5 per cent.
Currency analysts expect the pound's fall to go on, as the Bank would be forced to cut interest rates repeatedly. 
"We called the pound the 'dollar of 2008', and it hasn't disappointed," said Ashraf Laidi at CMC Markets.

The stock market is in febrile mood. The oil price has never been higher, worries abound about the state of 
consumer  spending and airline share prices are in sharp retreat, led this week by EasyJet with a fall of 20 per cent 
over two days.
Andy Harrison, EasyJet chief executive, decided on Wednesday it was time to buy and spent GBP248,000 on his 
airline's shares, which are down 42 per cent over the past nine months.
He is yet to share stock market disquiet about the outlook for low-cost carriers, in spite of issuing somewhat weak 
traffic figures on Tuesday, triggering the sharp price fall.
"EasyJet will win through in the tougher economic environment," Mr Harrison told the Financial Times. It will be 
helped, he says, by the low average age of its fleet and the fuel efficiency of its new Airbus aircraft.
All carriers will seek to pass on higher fuel costs to passengers, he says, supporting fare levels. Many rival low-cost 
and charter airlines will probably be cautious in adding capacity, he adds, assisting the growth of EasyJet and 
Ryanair, its big competitor.
Many investors appear to have interpreted EasyJet's weaker December traffic figures as a veiled profit warning,  
but Mr Harrison says stock market rules would enforce disclosure if he knew anything untoward about the outlook. 
He has  made no such disclosure, he says, and is sticking to previous guidance for a rise in pre-tax profits of about 
20 per cent in the year to the end-September.
EasyJet stays calm amid airlines retreat
"It is clearly a more difficult time, we must pass on fuel costs and the consumer environment is tougher, but EasyJet 
will do relatively well going through this environment. Our revenues are on track. We are getting the revenues we 
need."
Most important, revenues are being boosted by the introduction last October of its first charges for checked- in 
bags. The charge was raised to GBP3.99 a bag in November and with about three-quarters of an expected 42m 
passengers this year checking in bags, the airline has already created a useful revenue cushion.
Increasingly, EasyJet is also becoming less dependent on the UK, as it rolls out a pan-European strategy by 
opening a series of bases around continental Europe with the main emphasis in France, Italy and Spain. About a 
third of its network capacity is now deployed at mainland European bases, up from 23 per cent in 2006.
Two years ago it opened a base at Milan's Malpensa airport, where it is taking full advantage of the woes suffered 
by Alitalia, the struggling Italian flag carrier. It will have 15 aircraft based in Milan by the end of the year, making it 
the group's third-largest base after London Gatwick and London Luton airports and ahead of London Stansted.
Last year it opened Madrid as a base and this spring two new bases are being added in France at Paris Charles de 
Gaulle and Lyon airports.
Easyjet is also establishing a new domestic stronghold at Gatwick, supported by the takeover of GB Airways, the 
British Airways franchise carrier.
Including the acquisition, it will have 35 aircraft at Gatwick - a presence to rival the retrenching BA.

European equities fell sharply on Wednesday after retail stocks were severely hit by disappointing sales numbers 
from Britain's Marks & Spencer.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 1.2 per cent to 1,448.92, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax lost 0.7 per cent to 7,800.13, the 
CAC 40 in Paris was down 1.1 per cent to 5,432.92 and London's FTSE 100 slid 1.4 per cent to 6,268.0.
Stock markets were further undermined by hefty overnight losses on Wall Street. The S&P 500 lost 1.8 per cent, 
taking its combined losses so far in 2008 to 5.3 per cent - its worst start to a year on record.
Investors were heavy sellers of retail stocks after Britain's Marks & Spencer, the high street bellwether, lost 20 per 
cent following its worst quarterly sales figures in two years. The company sent further chills through the sector by 
warning of tough times ahead.
Spanish fashion retailer Inditex lost 2.4 per cent to 35.80, while Swedish rival H&M lost 4 per cent to SKr353.  
French group PPR lost 3.2 per cent to 94.21.
Food retailers were also hurt, with Dutch supermarket group Ahold down 5.3 per cent to 8.54 and France's 
Carrefour off 3.1 per cent to 48.83.
Fears that a global economic slowdown will hit consumer spending worldwide weighed on the airline sector. Air 
France-KLM shed 5.9 per cent to 20.47, Ryanair slid 3.1 per cent to 3.80 and Deutsche Lufthansa slipped 2.9 per 
cent to 17.09.

A dismal performance by European retailers led the continent's stock markets sharply lower on Tuesday as fears 
escalated about a global economic slowdown.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 1.2 per cent to 1,448.92, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax lost 0.7 per cent to 7,800.13, the 
CAC 40 in Paris was down 1.1 per cent to 5,432.92 and London's FTSE 100 slid 1.4 per cent to 6,268.0.
Stock markets were further undermined by hefty overnight losses on Wall Street. The S&P 500 lost 1.8 per cent, 
taking its combined losses so far in 2008 to 5.3 per cent - its worst start to a year on record.
"People are worried about a US recession, and they are very nervous so they are watching for any bad news from 
companies and are not inclined to accept any bad guidance," said Thierry Lacraz, strategist at Pictet & Cie.
Investors were heavy sellers of retail stocks after M&S, the high street bellwether, lost 20 per cent following its 
worst quarterly sales figures in two years. The company sent further chills through the sector by warning of tough 
times ahead.
"These figures missed analyst expectations and sent jitters through the market flagging further concern of a 
reduction in consumer spending," said Nick Mitchell, a trader at CMC Markets.
The bad news from the British high street hit European peers. Sweden's Hennes & Mauritz fell 3.7 per cent to 
SKr354, France's PPR down 3.3 per cent to 94.10 and Spain's Inditex, which owns the Zara chain, dropped 2.6 per 
cent to 35.71.

Food retailers were also hurt, with Dutch supermarket group Ahold down 5.3 per cent to 8.54 and France's

Fears that a global economic slowdown will hit consumer spending worldwide weighed on the airline sector. Air 
France-KLM was the sector's worst performer, down 5.9 per cent to 20.47, after Jean-Cyril Spinetta, chief 
executive, revealled he will begin talks in Rome on Thursday over a possible takeover of Alitalia. The struggling 
Italian carrier fell 3 per cent to 0.76.
Ryanair slid 3.1 per cent to 3.80 and Deutsche Lufthansa slipped 2.9 per cent to 17.09.
Investors shunned volatile high growth stocks sending the renewable energy sector tumbling with German solar 
power company Q-cells down 5.7 per cent to 84.69. German chemical company Wacker Chemie, which makes the 
silicon used in solar panels, tumbled 5 per cent to 157.02 and Spanish wind power company Gamesa fell 4.9 per 
cent to 27.35.
Defensive stocks were the day's main gainers with pharmaceuticals extending their climb, with Switzerland's Roche 
up 1.7 per cent at SFr220.80 and Denmark's Novo Nordisk up 1.7 per cent to DKr331.50.
Utilities also remained in positive territory with German Eon up 1.4 per cent at 151.25 and domestic peer RWE up 
0.9 per cent 99.94.

Sterling fell to an 11-year low against European currencies on Wednesday after unexpectedly poor Christmas sales 
figures from one of Britain's leading retailers raised fresh fears about the health of the UK economy.
The weak Marks and Spencer trading statement, which came ahead of a Bank of England meeting to set interest 
rates on  Thursday, sent shockwaves through retail, airline and travel company shares across Europe.
The FTSE 100 index fell 1.3 per cent, with retail shares having their worst day for 20 years, slumping by 9.6 per 
cent. Similar fears of slowing consumption across Europe pushed the FTSEurofirst 300 index 1.2 per cent lower.
Airline shares were also hard hit. EasyJet's share price tumbled for the second day in succession, closing 7.9 per 
cent lower after a fall of 13.9 per cent on Tuesday. Tui Travel fell by 14 per cent, Ryanair by 8.1 per cent and Air 
France-KLM by 5.8 per cent.
Sir Stuart Rose, chief executive of M&S, joined the chorus of retailers calling on the Bank of England to cut rates.
He said: "We need an interest rate reduction. It is the toughest [trading conditions] I have seen in a decade ... This 
is not a banana republic, this is Great Britain. But clearly people are very worried."
Sir Stuart's comments came the day after Alistair Darling, the UK chancellor, broke the long-standing convention 
not to put political pressure on the Bank of England over interest rates, arguing it had "room for manoeuvre"  on 
monetary policy.
The chancellor's words brought swift condemnation from economists keen to preserve the independence of the 
central bank's monetary policy committee.
Fears rise for UK economy
Professor Willem Buiter of the London School of Economics, a former MPC member, said Mr Darling should "learn 
and practise the art of silence" when it comes to rates decisions as it is "undermining one of the crowning 
achievements of the Blair-Brown years".
The MPC's deliberations over rate cuts were severely complicated by the rapid decline of sterling over the past  
month, as a weaker currency will stimulate the economy and feed into higher import prices.
Sterling dropped another 0.5 per cent against the euro on Wednesday, leaving it at its lowest against that currency 
since the euro's creation in 1999, and its weakest against European currencies since the end of 1996. It also fell  
0.7 per cent against the dollar to $1.9575, its lowest level in nine months.
Since peaking against the dollar above $2.11 in early November, the pound has fallen more than 7 per cent against 
the greenback and has dropped 6.5 per cent against the euro.
Currency analysts said they expected the pound's decline to continue as the Bank of England would be forced to 
cut rates. Ashraf Laidi at CMC Markets said: "We had described the pound as the 'dollar of 2008', and so  far it 
hasn't disappointed".

Ryanairon Friday revealed it carried 18 per cent more passengers in December than a year ago.
But shares in the low-cost airline remained under pressure as soaring crude prices, an uncertain outlook in the 
global economy and a weak pound prompted jittery investors to take flight.
Passenger volume rose from 3.36m last December to 3.95m - in line with analyst expectations. Nonetheless, 
shares in the Irish carrier fell 13 cent to 4.14 on Friday. The fall comes in the wake of Thursday's 5.8 per cent slide.
Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy, the Irish stockbroker, said the market was waiting for guidance on revenue per 
seat when the group gives its third quarter trading update next month. "You can't read too much into traffic 
numbers, especially not a one-month figure," he said. "While passenger volume is clearly up, what the market really 
wants to see is underlying passenger number. We won't get a sense of what profit will be like until we get numbers 
on passenger yield and ancillary revenues."
In November, Ryanair said yields, or average fares, will decrease by at least 5 per cent in the second half, as a 
result of higher travel taxes and a consumer spending slowdown in the UK, its biggest market.
The company has responded to the decline by charging passengers for priority boarding and checked bags to 
increase ancillary revenues.
Ancillary revenues - which include commission earnings from hotel, car rental and travel insurance bookings and 
checked in baggage charges - accounted for 16 per cent of turnover during the first half of the financial year and the 
airline has set a target of increasing it to 20 per cent.
Ryanair fails to take off on traffic rise
 British Airways reported a 1 per cent increase in passenger traffic as premium traffic was up 6.5 per cent in 
December, compared with a 0.1 per cent gain in economy traffic.

In Europe at least, international train travel is enjoying a renaissance. The ever more popular Eurostar between 
London and Paris, Spain's expanding network of AVE high-speed trains, the ICE network in Germany - just as we 
are beginning to understand that criss-crossing the world by air may leave very little of the world for our children to 
criss-cross at all, it looks as though an older, slower, greener and altogether more satisfying way of travel has 
smartened up its offerings.
Unfortunately for the planet, the rail revolution is not going to happen until the rail companies take a hard look at the 
appeal of flying - speed aside. We, as travellers, also need to rethink what we want out of a journey. Meanwhile, 
train travel can involve a series of minor but very palpable frustrations.
It starts with buying a ticket. As air travellers, we tend to work out that we want to go from A to B, spend an hour  or 
so entering dates on various websites and consider the difference between prices at different times of the day.
Going by train is more complicated. For a start, you're not really going from A to B - you're going from A  to H, with a 
connection in J, catching a ferry to K and arriving in B 24 hours later. That's half the fun, of course, but it means 
interacting with a number of different ticketing systems, not all of which work as smoothly as they should.
Luckily, to help them through this maze, rail travellers can draw on a resource greater than anything air travellers  
could even dream of.
The website The Man in Seat 61, run as a labour of love by a man called Mark Smith (he gets some income from 
the ads, but that's about it), will tell you everything you want to know about train travel almost anywhere in the world 
- though it works best if you are setting off in the UK. It tells you about times, prices, ticketing arrangements, routes  
to avoid and even on-board catering. And, in astonishing detail, it tells you the best way to buy a ticket. It was 
Why trains beat planes (almost always)
through The Man in Seat 61 that I found I should buy the second leg of my journey first because it would give me a 
discount that wasn't available the other way round. That's when you really appreciate a railway geek.
But whatever discounts you stumble across, chances are that your train trip will cost you a lot more than the same 
journey by air. One New Year trip that I made from London to Rome cost me almost 10 times the Ryanair fare - a 
fact that drew howls of incredulity from my friends as they hopped on to the airport express. But the mistake, of 
course, is not to compare like with like.
Blame it on the internet, blame it on the Wright brothers, but modern life has lulled us into assuming that the faster 
something is, the better - and that if it is better, it should cost more.
Train travel challenges that. Unlike the white-knuckle ride of flying, trains start almost imperceptibly; sometimes you 
notice you are on your way only as the platform slips behind you. And they give you time - time to walk around, the  
think, to doze. You can join fellow passengers for a game of cards or take a stroll through the carriages, standing by 
an open window and feeling the rush of cold air. Or, as I did a couple of years ago on that trip to Italy, you can sit in 
the dining car with a bottle of wine and a good book and watch the carriage lights catch the ice on the tracks as you 
ascend into the Alps.
Travelling by train means the first and last days of your holiday are usually spent getting there and back. Think of  
this as time to decompress, adjust and anticipate. In my book that is well worth the extra cost.
But some aspects of train travel do make the cost hard to swallow: travelling second-class on a train is not always 
more comfortable than flying economy. Spain's Trenhotel services from France, for example, are clean and simple 
but some of the seats in second appear to have been designed by someone who has never sat down. And there is 
something odd about sleeping perpendicular to the direction of travel. (Still, not as odd as sleeping upright with a 
crying baby behind you and the cabin crew pushing past a trolley full of booze).
And there is the bureaucracy. On a trip to Spain last year, I had my bag stolen from the villa I stayed in, and, with it, 
my return train ticket. Had I been with flying with almost any European airline, I would barely have noticed the 
inconvenience, and could have just popped to an internet cafe to print off my e-ticket from the website. Not so with 
long-distance rail travel: I had a numbered seat with an assigned couchette, my name was on the ticket and on the 
passenger list - but the rail company would not issue a duplicate. Instead, they said I had to buy a new ticket and, 
although we knew there would be an empty seat with my name on it, they couldn't guarantee a place.
In the end, the rail company and I reached a compromise but, like all poor customer service, it left an annoying 
taste in my mouth.

European equity markets moved lower on Thursday as investors remained cautious in the face of record oil prices 
and slowing economic growth.
By midday, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was down 0.0.9 per cent to 1,473.95, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax fell 1.1 per cent to 
7,864.13, the CAC 40 in Paris shed 0.5 per cent 5,520.56 and London's FTSE 100 slipped 0.3 per cent to 6,400.6.
Retailers drove the losses as the weak economic outlook and disappointing sales at UK fashion group Next 
weighed on the sector.
Inditex, the Spanish fashion retailer which owns the Zara chain, fell 4.2 per cent to 40.42, Swedish rival H&M lost 3 
per cent to SKr374.50, while France's PPR lost 3 per cent to 105.88.
Oil prices hit $100 a barrel for the first time on Wednesday and remained well above $99 on Thursday. Airlines and 
other stocks with high exposure to fuel costs added to the weakness.
Ryanair, the Irish budget carrier, fell 5.2 per cent to 4.35, while Lufthansa lost 3 per cent to 17.65 and Air France-
KLM shed 2 per cent to 23.17.
German budget operator Air Berlin, however, climbed 5.6 per cent to 13.11 after stakebuilding by holding company 
Vatas, which holds 15.4 per cent of voting rights through its Haarlem One subsidiary.
Carmakers were also victims of high oil prices and the weakening economy. Daimler fell 4 per cent to 62.16, while 
Porsche fell 3.9 per cent to 1,323.93 and Volkswagen lost 2.8 per cent to 96.35.
Growth fears spook European stocks
Deutsche Postbank bucked the weaker financial sector, rising 1.4 per cent to 62.18, as speculation intensified that  
Germany's biggest retail bank will be up for sale later this year.
CRH, the Irish aggregates and building materials supplier, rose 2.5 per cent to 24.55 after reporting an 18 per cent 
rise in full-year pre-tax profit and forecast further growth in 2008.
Deutsche Borse, the German stock exchange operator, fell 5.3 per cent to 121.80 after reporting volume growth on 
its trading platforms slowed in December.

A South African aviation entrepreneur has taken a 15.4 per cent stake in Germany's Air Berlin, putting the majority 
of the low-cost carrier's stock into the hands of two groupings of airline-industry insiders.
Investors saw the move as a sign that an airline leading the consolidation of German aviation could itself soon be 
up for sale. Its stock rose 10 per cent to 13.66, valuing the group at about 900m.
Europe's third-largest budget carrier has bought three national rivals since going public 18 months ago, but its 
share price fell by a quarter last year as it reported problems integrating LTU, a big charter airline.
Air Berlin's founders and top management own 35 per cent of the company - in parcels ranging from 0.22 per cent  
to 7.6 per cent - but have recently signalled a willingness at least to dilute their stakes.
Their share in the company could shrink by up to a third at the start of next year, when Air Berlin plans to pay 
Thomas Cook, the UK travel group, in new shares and cash for Condor, another charter carrier.
Air Berlin on Thursday said Berlin-based Vatas Holdings - controlled by South African Rob Hersov - had become its 
single biggest shareholder, apparently after no more than cursory contact at investor meetings.
Air Berlin said the company had no information about its new investor's intentions. Mr Hersov, who lives and works 
in London, declined to comment.
Mr Hersov's track record shows he has previously profited from airline consolidation. He sold Marquis Jets, an 
executive-jet service, to Netjets, a US rival, in 2004 and remains vice-chairman of Netjets Europe.
South African buys stake in Air Berlin
He also owned stakes in Freenet, a German telecoms group, which last year unsuccessfully sought to merge with 
rival Talkline, and Balda, a high-tech company once mooted to be looking at a deal in the US.
Since going public in 2006, Air Berlin has bought German carriers dba and LTU, and committed to buying Condor in 
early 2009 - a cash-and-shares deal that still needs approval from national cartel authorities.
Depending on the carrier's valuation at that time, Thomas Cook, its current owner, could end up holding almost 30 
per cent in the merged group via a capital increase that would dilute existing Air Berlin stakes.
Air Berlin's strategy of making acquisitions has set it apart from rivals Ryanair and Easyjet, which have so far 
favoured organic growth. The strategy has turned Air Berlin into an unusual hybrid of low-cost and charter airline.
Air Berlin said last week Deutsche Bank held 15.02 per cent of its stock. The German lender, which helped the 
company go public, has long held a stake of more than 8 per cent.

Deutsche Borse extended its losses into a second day as investors took profits in the face of record oil prices and 
fears of slowing economic growth.
The German exchange operator fell 3.3 per cent to 124.64 after volume growth on its trading platforms slowed in 
December.
Rumours circulated that TCI and Atticus, the hedge funds, were selling stakes, and with headwinds building in 
Europe's economy, traders said it was time to take profits in one of last year's best performers.
The stock price almost doubled in 2007.
The benchmark pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged 0.2 per cent lower to 1,484.83, with stakebuilding talk and 
strength in the oil sector offsetting losses by retailers after poor results and a weak economic outlook from peers in 
the UK.
Spanish fashion retailer Inditex, which owns the Zara chain, fell 2.3 per cent to 41.19, Swedish rival H&M lost  3 per 
cent to SKr374.50, and France's PPR lost 4 per cent to 104.83. German retail chain Metro fell 2.7 per cent to 53.99.
Slowing growth was also seen in the technology sector, with TomTom of the Netherlands tumbling 7.2 per cent to 
47.96.
The world's largest maker of car navigation equipment fell the most since December 12 after telling analysts that its 
sales were slowing.
Rising oil prices buffeted airlines and other stocks with high exposure to fuel costs.
Retailers' poor results a drag on Europe
Ryanair, the Irish budget carrier, fell 7 per cent to 4.27, while Lufthansa lost 2.5 per cent to 17.75 and Air France-
KLM shed 1.5 per cent to 23.28.
The oil price boosted energy companies, which were among the day's biggest gainers, with Gaz de France up 4.6 
per cent to 41.49 and Total up 2.4 per cent to 57.65.
"If the oil price continues to climb, it is bad news for Europe. The short-run impact is inflationary, but ultimately it will 
squeeze real personal incomes and that in turn will squeeze people's ability to spend money, [and will] inhibit 
growth rates and corporate profits," said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin.
"Recent data US are pointing to a considerable loss of momentum in the US economy and that is going to impact 
on global trade."
A US slowdown would reverberate in Europe with exporters such as car companies among the big losers, he said.
Germany's Daimler slipped 2.7 per cent to 62.91, domestic rival BMW dropped 1.5 per cent to 42.09, Volkswagen  
lost 1.6 per cent to 151.81, and France's Peugeot and Renault dropped 2.7 per cent and 2.3 per cent to 49.90 and  
93.54 respectively.
In Germany, stakebuilding talk boosted the day's gainers.
Budget operator Air Berlin surged 10.2 per cent to 13.69 after stakebuilding by holding group Vatas, which holds 
15.4 per cent of the voting rights through its Haarlem One subsidiary.
Deutsche Postbank bucked the weaker financial sector, rising 2.9 per cent to 63.01, as speculation intensified that  
Germany's biggest retail bank would be up for sale later this year.
Commerzbank is in the frame as a possible buyer.
Adidas, the world's second-largest sporting goods maker, edged up 0.1 per cent to 50.00 with talk of a Russian  
investor buying a stake of between 5 and 25 per cent, which could lay the foundations for an eventual takeover, 
dealers  said.
Meanwhile, CRH, the Irish aggregates and building materials supplier, rose 4.4 per cent to 25 after reporting an 18  
per cent rise in full-year pre-tax profit and forecasting further growth in 2008.

Air France-KLM has started the first trial in Europe of the inflight use of mobile phones.
The service has been introduced this week onboard an Air France A318 operating on short-haul routes in Europe.
Initially passengers will be able to send and receive text and picture messages as well as emails via phones with 
internet access. In the second stage of the six-month trial passengers will be able to make and receive phone calls.
Many airlines are still wary of introducing full mobile phone use onboard because of the disturbance to other 
passengers.
Airline passenger surveys have shown that opinion is evenly divided, and Air France said it would examine 
feedback and comments from passengers to determine whether to launch the service on all flights.
Further single aircraft trials are planned in Europe by both BMI British Midland and TAP Air Portugal.
Ryanair, the Irish low cost carrier, is already planning to introduce the service across its entire fleet, which is due to 
total more than 160 aircraft flying 50m passengers next year. It will introduce the service on 25 aircraft by the end of 
March, probably on flights to and from London Stansted.
Air France and most of the other airlines in Europe planning early trials are using the system developed by OnAir, a  
joint venture between Sita and Airbus. It may only be used at cruising altitude above 10,000ft (3,000m) once the 
new illuminated sign "Switch off your phone" is turned off.
Costs for using the service are invoiced by the customers' home telephone operator and are comparable to those 
used for normal international mobile phone calls.
Air France first to trial inflight mobile phone use in Europe
The Air France trial is the first use of a mobile telephony system on international flights, although Qantas has been 
trialling for several months in the Australian domestic market a rival system developed by AeroMobile, a joint 
venture between Arinc and Telenor.
Passengers' mobile phones connect to a miniature cellular network installed inside the aircraft.
Data and calls are transmitted to a satellite, which routes them to a ground station and then to the passenger's 
usual telephone network. This way the phones only emit at minimum power on the aircraft, avoiding interference 
with aircraft avionics or the ground telecoms network.

Two pioneering start-up operators of budget private jet services have completed equity funding rounds aimed at 
launching services in the next 18 months.
JetBird, an Irish company seeking to become one of the early pan-European operators of "very light private jets", 
raised 21m (GBP15m) in equity in preparation for financing its first 25 aircraft.
A second group, Blink, founded by two former investment bankers from UBS and Goldman Sachs, raised $30m 
(GBP14.8m) in equity from three private family funds and non-recourse bank debt to fund its first 30 Cessna 
Mustang four-passenger jets.
JetBird, founded by Domnhal Slattery, an Irish financier, will be the launch customer in Europe for the Embraer 
Phenom 100, part of a family of very light and light jets under development by the Brazilian aircraft maker.
Several US and European start-ups want to exploit the cheaper VLJs from aircraft makers including Embraer, 
Cessna and Eclipse of the US through new business models offering so-called air taxi services.
JetBird is planning two bases at London Stansted and Cologne/Bonn airports.
It plans later bases in France, Switzerland and Italy, as it seeks to bring lessons from the operating models of low-
cost commercial airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet to private jets. JetBird plans to fly to 75 airports around 
Europe.
Mr Slattery, a former executive at Royal Bank of Scotland, said the group would offer a service comparable to 
current business class standards, costing less than half some private jet services.
Air taxi pioneers in GBP30m funding
The 21m share placing was led by Claret Capital, a Dublin-based private equity fund founded by Mr Slattery in 
2005.
Blink plans to start operating out of Farnborough, a leading business airport close to London, next May.

European shares ended the week higher as continued optimism about the prospects for further US rate cuts 
underpinned  sentiment.
US non-farm payrolls data, released on Friday, encouraged hopes of a 25 basis point cut in the Fed funds target 
rate  next week.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 gained 0.8 per cent over the week to 1,538.51.
Germany's Xetra Dax index shrugged off a downgrade from Goldman Sachs to break through the key 8,000 level 
on Friday. The index has outperformed its European peers this year, rising more than 20 per cent, while the FTSE 
100 is up  5.4 per cent.
Goldman Sachs downgraded the Dax to "underweight," saying it once was one of the cheapest indices in Europe, 
but was now around average. "It is the most sensitive market to any downward revisions in GDP, and would be hit 
badly under a hard-landing scenario," Goldman said.
It was a busy week for Europe's insurers. German financial adviser AWD rocketed 28.1 per cent to 29.38 after news 
of a 30-a-share offer from Swiss Life. But shares in Switzerland's largest life insurer dropped on concerns it may be 
overpaying for the deal, falling 2.7 per cent to SFr309.50 on the week.
Germany's Munich Re jumped on Friday after news that Cevian Capital, a Swedish activist investor, had bought a 
stake of about 3 per cent in the world's second-biggest reinsurer. Christer Gardell, Cevian managing partner, told  
the Financial Times that Cevian was a "long-term" shareholder that wanted to "adopt an industrial approach and 
work with the management." Munich Re ended the week up 5.7 per cent at 131.6.
US jobs figures support Europe
The week's biggest winner was European broadcaster RTL, whose shares surged after German media group 
Bertelsmann said it might buy the 10.2 per cent of the company it did not already own. Shares in RTL, which has 
stakes in 39 TV channels across Europe, jumped more than 15 per cent on Wednesday and held on to the gains to 
end the week up 17.5 per cent at 81.4.
Swatch also had a good week, gaining 7.5 per cent to SFr340.75. Shares in the world's largest watchmaker rose on 
Thursday after the company said November sales were the "best ever" and announced it would buy back SFr 420m 
worth of stock to boost value.
At the bottom of Europe's pile, Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, revealed a 90m writedown against its 29 per  cent 
stake in domestic rival Aer Lingus.
The Aer Lingus shares cost Ryanair about 2.50 each, but hit a year low of 1.90 just over two weeks ago before 
closing on Friday at 2.09. Over the week Ryanair shares fell 8.6 per cent to 4.55.
StatoilHydro fell 10.9 per cent to NKr164.80 on Friday after revising down its 2007 oil and gas production target. 
The Norwegian energy group said the impact of field repairs would also dent growth in 2008. Over the week, the 
stock was down 8.4 per cent.
Roche, the world's biggest maker of cancer medicines, dropped 5.5 per cent to SFr203.70 after failing to win US  
approval for its key breast cancer drug Avastin. Analysts quickly cut their forecasts and price targets for the 
company.
The threat of new competition receded for TNT, the Dutch mail company, after the Dutch government said it was 
postponing plans to open up its mail market. Shares in TNT, which has a monopoly on delivering small letters, 
ended the  week up 4.5 per cent at 29.25.

Air Berlin, Europe's third-largest low-cost carrier, said unexpected problems integrating German charter carrier LTU 
would lead to a "low double-digit" million euro charge nine months after the deal.
Chief financial officer Ulf Huettmeyer said "considerable technical problems" had barred Air Berlin from cutting 
capacity as planned this month and last, thus lowering earnings achieved per seat.
The statement underlined the balancing act of airline consolidation in Europe, which has seen Air Berlin scoop up 
several German rivals to become a mixed low-cost and international network carrier.
Air Berlin stock fell 5 per cent to about 10 ($14.63 when the news was published, but it rallied to close 7 per cent 
higher at 11.25, a sign of the continued belief that Air Berlin could be sold at a premium before too long.
The airline also said that charges would be offset by one-off takings and that earnings targets for this year would be 
achieved.
In August it said operating profit would exceed the 64m (m$79) seen last year. The Berlin-based airline said it 
carried 2.05m passengers last month, 19 per cent more than in November 2006.
But this rise was still smaller than budgeted, the airline said, as problems with the integration of LTU blocked 
capacity cuts after the end of the summer season, usually the main season for air travel.
To counter pressure from rivals EasyJet of the UK and Ryanair from Ireland, Air Berlin this year added new routes 
to  profit from summer travel.
Air Berlin hurt by problems over LTU
In spite of the problem in achieving its ambitions at the latter end of this year, Air Berlin said in a statement it  was 
"right on track" with capacity reduction budgeted for the coming 12 months.

European shares softened as the banking sector rally petered out when rumours that Royal Bank of Scotland could 
face  further credit market writedowns dented investor confidence.
RBS denied the talk of writedowns but the speculation was enough to dent confidence in the sector, prompting 
some of  the banks that had led the rally to fall back sharply.
Austria's Raiffeisen International dropped 4 per cent to 106.99, while France's Natixis fell 2.7 per cent  to 13.50 
while Credit Agricole dropped 0.4 per cent to 22.94.
Swiss wealth manager UBS clung on to Wednesday gains rising 0.6 per cent to SFr54.9 and domestic peer Credit

European stocks fell in afternoon trade on Monday as airlines slumped following reports of the withdrawal of a bid 
for Iberia, while banks fell on further credit market woes.
By 4pm in London the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was down 0.3 per cent at 1,472.43, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax slipped 0.3 per 
cent to 7,583.21, the CAC 40 lost 0.9 per cent to 5,471.28 and London's FTSE 100 fell 0.8 per cent to 6,210.8.
Reports that the consortium led by private equity group TPG and British Airways had dropped its bid 3.4bn bid for 
Spain's Iberia drove the shares 1.9 per cent lower to 3.14 before trade in the stock was suspended.
Shares in Irish budget airline Ryanair fell 5.6 per cent to 4.56, while BA fell 4.6 per cent to 330p.
French bank Natixis fell 4.6 per cent to 12.99 after revealing a 407m credit-related hit to its third-quarter results.
Engineering and metals stocks had earlier lifted European markets thanks to a broad recovery of the industrial 
sectors, hit in recent weeks by fears of economic slowdown denting demand.
Scania and Volvo, the Swedish truckmakers, were among the top gainers, lifted by indications the European truck 
market would continue to show robust growth, offsetting weakness in the North American market.
Volvo published data that showed unit sales in the nine months to the end of October rose by 2 per cent. Its shares 
B shares climbed 2.7 per cent to SKr105.25, while the B shares of Scania, which makes the bulk of its earnings in 
Europe,  gained 3.4 per cent to SKr144.75.
Carmakers were boosted by hopes that European consumer confidence would survive the worst of the financial 
crunch of  recent months. Brokers were a little more cautious, however.

"We still believe the sector can deliver on its promise of above-market earnings growth in 2008, on the back of  
emerging markets growth and lower costs. However, until the market's mood lightens we think investors will prefer 
more defensive sectors," said Michael Tyndall at Nomura, recommending an "underweight" stance on the sector.
Nevertheless, Porsche shares were up 2.6 per cent to 1,408, Renault climbed 0.6 per cent to 94.70 and Fiat rose 
0.9 per cent to 18.09.

European airline customers are being deceived by false prices and misleading advertising on hundreds of websites, 
the European commission will warn on Wednesday.
More than 200 websites that sell air tickets are breaking EU consumer rules and face possible legal action and 
closure if they do not clean up their act.
More than half of all websites analysed in the Commission's consumer 'sweep', undertaken by national authorities 
in fifteen member states and Norway, were found to have irregularities in price advertising and the availability of 
advertised fares. Others failed to provide the terms and conditions in the language of the consumer.
A spokeswoman for the Commissioner for consumer affairs, Meglena Kuneva, said on Tuesday: "The legal basis is 
very clear: advertising that misleads consumer to make a choice they would not otherwise have made is quite 
clearly banned."
The sweep found on a number of websites that the price of the ticket is first indicated without airport taxes and 
additional fees.
The worst situation was in Belgium, which found that 46 out of 48 of the websites investigated contained 
irregularities.
A Commission official said: "From the picture we have already, it is clear it is not just low-fare, cheap ticket airlines. 
There are well known travel agencies, the problem is across the board."
EC warns airlines against misleading websites
EU law decrees a number of minimum standards, such as access to clear pricing, availability of information and of 
fair advertising under the EU Misleading Advertising Directive.
Clear pricing, including taxes or credit card fees should be indicated from the start, the Commission says.
Following the sweep in September, the Spanish consumer affairs watchdog found that seven out of the eleven most 
visited air company websites in Spain featured deceptive publicity.
The regulator, the Spanish National Consumer group, found that the websites of Ryanair and Vueling, a Spanish 
low-cost carrier, announced "free" tickets when customers were later charged airport taxes.
Other websites were criticised for breaking legal requirements - while the sale information was written in Spanish, 
the obligatory terms and conditions were only available in English.
Ryanair said on Tuesday they were confident that any investigation would prove its ticket-sales and advertising 
were  fair: "Ryanair always has the information and terms and conditions available in the languages of the countries 
we fly to and from.
"We feel our website comes up to scratch - but if there are any problems found we would of course make the 
changes recommended by the Commission."
The average Ryanair fare of 44, they added, was the lowest in Europe.
"No other airline matches Ryanair's low fares availability with over 50% of all seats (25 million this year) sold at the 
lowest two fares."
However, John Shine, director of commercial practices at the Irish National Consumer Agency said they would be in 
contact with a number of Irish airlines, among them Ryanair, over the next few weeks. "We currently have concerns 
across a number of fronts," he said.
The owners of problem websites now have until January to respond to the Commission's complaints and make any 
necessary improvements before they are named or any further action taken.

Q: It has been suggested the UK government's recent decision to tax flights rather than individual passengers could 
mean more last-minute discounts as airlines desperately try to fill every seat. What impact do you think it will have 
on business travellers GP, Account Manager, London
A: The decision certainly creates headaches for airline yield managers, whose job it is to ensure the maximum 
return  from each seat. But I do not really buy the idea that it will lead to a surge of last-minute price cuts. After all, 
filling every available seat is important to airline revenues with or without a per flight tax. It is more likely carriers will 
divide the tax between passengers based on average load factors (the number of passengers per flight), which is 
bound to result in some perceived unfairness. One possibility is that they may try to reduce "no shows" - 
passengers with fully-flexible tickets who do not turn up for their flights - by offering a greater range  of fares with 
penalties for cancellation. The tax, scheduled to take effect on November 1, 2009, will probably deter airlines from 
operating routes on which traffic is relatively light. So travellers needing to get to places away from the mainstream 
may incur greater inconvenience. Its harshest impact will be on business class-only airlines, whose aircraft are fitted 
with fewer seats than conventional carriers.
Q: Why do more low-cost airlines not allow us to pay a bit more to have a seat assigned at check-in? Flying on 
business is stressful enough as it is without the scramble when you board. EasyJet does, but I was once assigned a 
seat  on one of their flights and we were then put on a bus to the aircraft - so I still had to put up with the same old 
bunfight.PD, consultant, Somerset United Kingdom
A: One no-frills airline, Ryanair, says the free-for-all saves time and money. Another, bmibaby, claims the opposite. 
Ryanair has tested pre-assignment and is convinced open seating enables it to restrict turn-round time between 
flights to 25 minutes. That results in optimum use of aircraft and holds down costs. Bmibaby says: "We think it 
saves time  if there is no rugby scrum on board. We also have a lot of business passengers who like to select a 
Ask Global Traveller
particular seat." Ryanair does operate a priority boarding system that allows passengers to be among the first 60 on 
board its 189-seat jets. This costs GBP2 (2.80, $4.15) per customer with bags to check in but is free to those 
carrying only hand luggage. EasyJet charges between GBP2.50 and GBP7.50 - it varies between airports - for a 
service called "Speedy Boarding". This buys priority for the first 20 to 30 passengers. The airline says sometimes it 
is necessary to bus  passengers to the aircraft, as happened in your case. But it adds if it means you no longer get 
priority you can ask for a refund.
Q: My company seems to want to track my every movement when I am on the road. They say it is for my own 
security. I just find it intrusive. The risk of anything going seriously wrong on a trip is remote. Do they really need to 
to spend  money keeping tabs on me NC, London
A: Under the UK's new corporate manslaughter legislation, which takes effect next April, your company is even 
more likely to want to know where you are - or at least that you are sticking to its travel policy. The law will make it 
easier to prosecute your employer for gross negligence in failing to exercise a duty of care towards you. This could 
make it more important for travel managers to staff are using approved accommodation and transport. Your 
company may need you to use a pre-booked taxi from the airport in some places, for example. You are not alone in 
finding close tracking intrusive. Perhaps it can be abused but isn't the feeling you are being watched a touch 
paranoid? Are you  one of those rare travellers who avoid the temptation to check the Blackberry? Travel managers 
who have had staff involved in disasters say the ability to discover whether staff are safe and inform relatives in a 
very short time is a  major plus. One says that whenever he gives a talk on the benefits of tracking he shows a 
television news clip of a family greeting a traveller evacuated from a crisis in Lebanon. The image of their relief, he 
says, is a powerful persuader.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, increased its profits sharply in its first six months and raised its forecast 
for full-year profits.
The Irish carrier said that it would launch a trial of its inflight mobile phone service on 25 aircraft by the end of March 
allowing passengers to receive and make phone calls and text messages by their mobiles or blackberries. The 
airline is aiming to be the first carrier in Europe to launch a mobile phone service across its entire fleet.
Ryanair said on Monday its net profits in the first six months to the end of September had risen by 24 per cent from  
329m to 408m, while turnover increased by 24 per cent from 1.3bn to 1.6bn.
Passenger numbers rose by 20 per cent to 26.6m, while the average fare level declined by 1 per cent.
The group remained the world's most profitable airline with a net profit margin of 26 per cent in the first six  months.
Ryanair said its performance was supported by a strong increase in ancillary revenues, including commission 
earnings  from hotel, car rental and travel insurance bookings and checked in baggage charges, which rose in total 
by 54 per cent  to 252m. Ancillary revenues accounted for 16 per cent of turnover, and the airline has set a target of 
increasing this  to 20 per cent.
The airline has also introduced a GBP2/3 charge for passengers choosing to use airport check-in desk facilities in 
order to encourage the use of online check-in, as a new step to cut costs and increase ancillary revenues.
Ryanair 's first-half profits soar
Ryanair said it had implemented its 20 per cent reduction in the number of aircraft it was operating at Stansted 
during the winter months. The cut in capacity would bring "more stability" to fare levels, reduce operating costs and 
eliminate losses on unprofitable winter routes at the airport.
It revised upwards its forecast for full-year profits to an increase of 17.5 per cent to 470m up from the previous 
guidance of 440m. Ryanair said that the fall in average fares during the winter was expected to be at the lower end 
of  its previous forecast for a decline of 5-10 per cent.
The group said it had spent 267m during the last two months buying back 53.5m shares representing about 3.5 per 
cent of its issued share capital.
The big increase in profits in the first half has been achieved despite higher oil prices and a doubling of airport 
charges at London Stansted, the airline's biggest operating base in Europe.
Ryanair repeated its call for BAA's monopoly ownership of London's three biggest airports to be broken up.  The 
BAA monopoly is under investigation by the UK Competition Commission.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the Civil Aviation Authority, the economic regulator for BAA's London 
airports, had "repeatedly failed to effectively regulate this monopoly which is why it continues  to provide third world 
service levels at extortionate prices."
The airline is opening four new operating bases during the winter months at Valencia, Alicante, Bristol and Belfast 
City, and expects to announce one or two more in coming weeks for launch next summer.

Troubled financial stocks continued their downhill slalom on Monday, dragging European indices lower for a third 
consecutive session, while Franco-German aerospace group EADS fell sharply after it announced that production 
delays on  a military aircraft would eat into profits.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 0.7 per cent to 1,549.22, mainly because confidence in the financial sector continued to  
be hurt by the fall-out from the credit market turmoil.
Chuck Prince quit as chairman and chief executive of Citigroup on Sunday night as the company revealed it was 
facing  between $8bn and $11bn of further losses on its holdings of subprime-related securities.
The news weighed on European financials. Societe Generale dropped 2.1 per cent to 106.34. Bear Stearns cut its 
recommendation on France's second biggest bank to "peer perform" from "outperform" as it lowered 2008 earnings 
estimates for French banks by 10 per cent.
Although banks had already written down billions of dollars in assets linked to US subprime mortgage lending, 
deteriorating US housing market fundamentals continued to put pressure on capital markets as investors became 
risk averse, the brokerage said.
"We believe the outlook for [French banks'] derivatives, structured finance and proprietary trading businesses has 
deteriorated," it added.
BNP Paribas slid 1.7 per cent to 70.32, while Natixis slumped 1.5 per cent to 13.87, while Credit Agricole edged 
down 0.8 per cent to 25.66 after both Lehman and Bear Stearns said the bank would continue to outperform its 
French peers.
European stocks extend downward slide
In Germany, Deutsche Postbank tumbled 4.8 per cent to 44.9 and Deutsche Bank fell 2.1 per cent to 85.16.
Swiss bank UBS slid 3.7 per cent to SFr54.6 while rival Credit Suisse softened 1.7 per cent to SFr71.25.
Volatile Irish banks also took a pummelling, with Bank of Ireland down 2.8 per cent to 11.49 and Anglo Irish Bank 
falling 4.5 per cent to 10.63.
European insurers followed their banking peers lower with Swiss Re sliding 2.1 per cent to SFr101.8 and France's 
Axa down 1.7 per cent to 29.52. Germany's Munich Re closed 1.8 per cent lower at 128.23 in spite of it saying it  
could exceed its earnings forecast for the full year.
EADS, Europe's leading aerospace and defence group, retreated 3.8 per cent to 22.02 after warning that delays of 
up to 12 months on the development of the A400M military transport aircraft would cut profits by 1.2bn-1.4bn in the 
third quarter.
Shares in Ireland's Ryanair fell by a sharp 4 per cent to 5.52 after it gave an update on passenger numbers, 
prompting Citigroup to keep its "buy" rating but note that the stock's valuation looked stretched.
However, the brokerage added that Ryanair would suffer less from rising fuel costs than its competitors further up 
the price range.
Talk that Siemens would post strong fourth-quarter numbers, and a flight to traditional manufacturing stocks in the 
face of the credit turmoil drove the German technical group up 1.1 per cent to 93.95, dealers said.
Chemicals group Bayer also gained 0.6 per cent to 57.01 on expectation it would post strong third-quarter numbers 
in spite of announcing that it had halted global sales of its anti-bleeding drug Trasylol.
Swedish engineering stocks Sandvik and Atlas Copco rose off their lows after reporting poor third-quarter numbers 
last month, rebounding 3 per cent to SKr119.25 and 2.4 per cent to SKr105 respectively.

BAA break-up can only improve these god-awful airports
BAA break-up can only improve these god-awful airports

From Mr Michael O'Leary.
Sir, Martin Wolf's claim (August 24) that the break up of the BAA monopoly is not the answer to the shambles at  
the London airports is simply wrong. The break-up of this overcharging, inefficient, "couldn't-care-less" monopoly 
will improve these airports and is one of the few things that most airlines now agree on.
While Mr Wolf is correct in calling the current baggage restrictions imposed by the Department for Transport 
irrational, he omits that these restrictions have been efficiently and effectively applied at many other UK airports 
without the long queues and frequent delays endured by passengers regularly at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. 
BAA has had more than 12 months to recruit additional security staff, yet still our passengers are repeatedly the 
victims of understaffing and closed security machines, particularly at peak periods. BAA, like most monopolies, talks 
a lot about customer service, but its actions demonstrate its contempt for customers.
It may not be BAA's fault that the UK planning process takes a long time. That being so, however, why aren't each 
of the BAA airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) pressing ahead for planning permission for additional 
facilities for 10 and 15 years hence? The reason is that, like most monopolies, BAA wishes to constrain capacity in 
order to maintain high prices. This has always been its policy. Even when planning new facilities, BAA knows that 
the Civil Aviation Authority's failed regulatory regime will reward it for every pound of overspend and inefficiency it 
can manage. Therefore, true to form, it wastes ridiculous sums of money building complex, inefficient facilities that 
don't work, and which its airlines and passengers don't want. Why, for example, would BAA spend less than 
GBP1bn building a second runway and terminal at Stansted, if it can waste GBP4bn doing it in the knowledge that 
the CAA will reward this higher spend with a future income stream that will be four times greater.
As one of BAA's largest customers, Ryanair is a staunch advocate of breaking up this high-cost, inefficient, under-
performing monopoly. At the very minimum, three competing London airports would each have an incentive to 
BAA break-up can only improve these god-awful airports
develop  additional capacity, at lower costs, with the support of their airline customers. Competition between the 
three airports would see better service delivery, shorter queues and lower car parking charges. Airlines and 
passengers at competing airports would have more influence over the service standards and processing times than 
we do now - which is none. BAA Stansted doesn't care if you are stuck for one hour in a security queue; it is going 
to get paid for that passenger anyway. In fact, BAA benefits from these long queues, by encouraging passengers to 
check in earlier and thereby spend more time and money in its shops and restaurants. If it can save a few bob by 
under-recruiting and keeping these security machines closed, then, of course, that's an added benefit and so that's 
what it will do.
One only has to point Mr Wolf to the example of the airline industry in recent years to demonstrate the effectiveness 
of breaking up monopolies and allowing competition to improve services and reduce prices. Not everyone may like 
low-fares airlines, but at least everyone now has a choice. The advent of Ryanair has transformed short-haul air 
travel  across Europe, with widely available air fares today that are less than one-tenth of the prices charged by 
British Airways and other high-fares airlines 20 years ago. Competition has transformed the airline industry, yet a 
regulated monopoly continues to deliver abject facilities, long queues and passenger disservice at BAA's London 
airports.
Martin Wolf is wrong. Breaking up the BAA monopoly can only improve these god-awful airports - and let's face it, 
after 20 years of BAA's protected monopoly, could the London airports really be any worse?

Tony Fernandes, the driving force behind the creation of AirAsia, the region's first low-cost, short-haul airline, is 
spreading his wings.
On Friday, the latest experiment to test the appetite of travellers for low-cost flying begins in Kuala Lumpur with the 
first flight by AirAsia X to Australia's Gold Coast airport, 40 minutes from Brisbane. Low-cost is going long-haul.
Within a couple of months, a second route from Kuala Lumpur is planned to Huang Zhou in China, and by October 
or November next year AirAsia X hopes to be flying its first route into Europe to London Stansted or Manchester.
In barely six years, Mr Fernandes has developed Asia's most successful no-frills carrier from an initial base in 
Malaysia, borrowing heavily from the established role models of Southwest Airlines in the US and Ryanair in 
Europe.
An accountant by training after studying at London School of Economics, the 43-year-old came into aviation from 
the music industry, where he had been vice-president for the Asean countries at Warner Music South-East Asia, 
before he quit in 2001.
Watching television in a pub in London on his way back from New York to Malaysia, he saw Stelios Haji-Ioannou, 
the EasyJet founder, criticising British Airways.
"I thought it was very interesting. I went to Luton and returned the next day to film [the EasyJet operation]. I thought 
it was amazing and thought I could bring that to Asia."
AirAsia chief spreads his wings
Mr Fernandes says he always loved aircraft as a child. He was sent from Malaysia to boarding school at Epsom 
College  and spent many hours at Heathrow plane-spotting on the way back and forth to London.
Short, rotund and effervescent, he cuts an unmistakable figure among his peers, with his open-necked white shirt 
worn always with a bright red baseball cap sporting the AirAsia logo. The cap is as much a part of the brand as the 
orange boiler suit affected by Stelios Haji-Ioannou in his early days at EasyJet.
Mr Fernandes has outdone his mentors, building the lowest cost base of any of the world's budget airlines with 
even lower unit costs than Ireland's Ryanair, the world's most profitable airline with operating margins of about 25 
per cent.
He is rapidly conquering the regional, short-haul space in south-east Asia. AirAsia, which began flying at the end of 
2001, will fly about 18m passengers this year. It has a fleet of about 60 aircraft and has secured the foundation for 
future growth with firm orders for 150 Airbus A320-family aircraft and options for a further 50.
The business base in Malaysia has been expanded through AirAsia-branded affiliates in Thailand and Indonesia. 
Another is under discussion in Vietnam and he is keenly eyeing an operation in the Philippines to complete the 
regional jigsaw.
Owning a minority 49 per cent in the ventures outside Malaysia has circumvented national aviation regulations on 
local ownership and control. China is the focus of the current wave of expansion from the bases around south-east 
Asia,  as he joins up the dots of the network.
"The building blocks are in place," he says, and the business has been well tested.
"We have survived tsunamis, bird flu, earthquakes, coups d'etat, nasty governments and the high oil price."
But now Mr Fernandes is taking the next step of the adventure into uncharted airspace, heading into low-cost long-
haul. It is territory where even Southwest's Herb Kelleher and Ryanair's Michael O'Leary have refused to go.
Mr O'Leary may have changed his tune somewhat from the days when he used to declare that he would "not touch 
long-haul with a barge-pole", but even the iconoclastic Irishman is yet to make the leap. Mr Fernandes is not 
waiting. "You only live once," he says.
Scheduled low-cost long-haul services have been tried before and failed in ill-fated ventures such as Freddie 
Laker's Skytrain out of the UK and Peoplexpress in the US 30 years ago.
"My philosophy is very clear," says Mr Fernandes. "Before a business can grow, it needs to have its costs under 
control. It must be cost-efficient and profitable, and it must create value. Costs that do not add value must be 
contained, reduced and even eliminated."
The process has no end. "If we do not strive to be more efficient and choose to be complacent - our days are 
numbered," he says. "This is a continuous task we have to face head-on year-on-year; it is the critical ingredient to 
operate a successful business."
Most of the experimental long-haul start-ups of the past couple of years have come up with business plans very 
much at the other end of the market, leading to the launch of an array of transatlantic all-business class carriers, 
including Eos Airlines, Maxjet Airways, Silverjet and L'Avion.
They have avoided going into the budget end of the market, not least because the legacy network carriers have 
traditionally subsidised low economy fare offerings at the back of the aircraft through the lucrative earnings made 
from premium travellers in the first- and business-class cabins.
Mr Fernandes believes he can still undercut the network airlines by cutting out the frills and avoiding the complexity 
and resulting costs that burden his competitors.
AirAsia chief spreads his wings
"We will save in simplicity and strictly point-to-point operations rather than the hub-and-spoke model, which is vastly 
inefficient." Secondary airports will be favoured, and AirAsia X will enjoy the feeder traffic from AirAsia's short-haul 
network. Connecting passengers will do the work themselves. There will be no costly baggage transfers and 
interlining.
Between Europe and Malaysia he is aiming at fares 50-60 per cent below the lowest offered by other airlines, with a 
return fare of about GBP200 ($410, 285), including taxes and charges.
Mr Fernandes may be the driving force behind the move into long-haul, but he is taking care not to undermine the 
existing business by any diversion of effort. He is staying as chief executive of Air-Asia itself, and AirAsia X is being 
set up as a separate company with a separate management and capital base.
AirAsia, which was launched on the stock market in Malaysia in 2004, has a stake of about 16 per cent in 
convertible  preference shares in AirAsia X, and will be linked through the brand and the marketing.
Mr Fernandes and his original partner Kamarudin Meranun are the dominant shareholders in both, while Sir Richard 
Branson, a long-term collaborator on the idea of AirAsia X, has also taken a minority stake.
The entry, just agreed, of two private equity funds - Orix from Japan and Manama from the Middle East - has raised 
further funding of $75m for a 20 per cent stake, valuing the business at $375m before its first flight.
Very soon, Mr Fernandes will have founded not one airline of his own but two, all in less than a decade.
Heavy brand promotion spreads the word
With his background in the music industry, it was perhaps inevitable that the holding company for Tony Fernandes' 
stake in AirAsia was called Tune Air. But it was AirAsia that became the brand name.
As a Malaysian of Indian descent - his father was from Goa, hence the Portuguese name - Mr Fernandes is 
promoting the airline's Asian base as he pushes for liberalisation of aviation across south-east Asia, while also 
seeking to create a global brand.
With Sir Richard Branson as a mentor and former employer - Mr Fernandes was financial controller at Virgin 
Communications in London in the late 1980s, before joining Warner Music International - Mr Fernandes is very 
aware of the power of the brand.
AirAsia's logo is highly visible at sporting events - from the shirt sleeves of English Premier League referees  to the 
rear spoilers of the Williams Formula One racing cars and the advertising boards at Old Trafford. AirAsia is a 
platinum sponsor of Manchester United, a powerhouse sporting brand in Asia.
"I am a big believer in brand building," he says. "I am trying to get my staff to be the Formula One [of aviation]. 
Aligning AirAsia with top brands helps . . . also with the bankers. I believe the cost of borrowing has gone down 
through the brand investment."

At the start of this year, I made a pact with my environmental conscience to travel by train wherever possible in 
Europe. I have broken it three times already. Not good. So coming back to London from the Mayr clinic in southern 
Austria, I was determined to stay on the tracks. People I spoke to at the clinic were aghast. "How long does it take? 
Twenty-four hours? You'll undo all the good work you achieved here - it'll take you a week to get over it." One 
American woman was forthright. "I'd never do that. I just want to get there, wherever I'm going, as quickly as 
possible."
I don't share these people's dismay at the idea of a long train journey: the only thing that horrified me was the price 
- at GBP193 one-way it's nearly 20,000 times more expensive than the cheapest Ryanair flight (cost 1p, excluding 
tax). In all sorts of other ways, the idea of planning a leisurely train itinerary appealed to me. I brought out my maps 
of Europe and looked at the route through the eastern Alps and then on through Germany, either the more 
southerly route through Munich and then Paris or going up to Cologne and then Brussels. I anticipated the joy and 
relief I would feel at not having to take another flight back home, with all its associated queuing, inhumane herding, 
and absurd shoe-removal routine.
So how did it work out in practice? Klagenfurt station is already more interesting than Klagenfurt airport and getting 
there allows you a glimpse of the rather handsome small Hapsburg city with its chestnut avenues. There could be  
no cafe in the airport as characterful as the station one where we took our peppermint tea, filled with some of the 
most desperate nicotine addicts in Carinthia.
The train goes quite slowly at first, along the north shore of the Worthersee, with spectacular views of the jagged 
Slovenian alps. The scenery nearly all the way to Munich (five hours) is magnificent: high mountain pasture and 
narrow valleys, towns beetled over by huge rock-cliffs, then Salzburg with its white castle and Baroque domes. I 
Back on track
remembered, with a shock at the passage of time, travelling this same journey in the other direction with my father 
half a lifetime  ago.
The only down side of the first leg was sharing a compartment with an otherwise pleasant young man who played 
twangy  music through his computer and made the usual deafening mobile phone calls. This was partly 
counteracted by Arthur Rubinstein's Chopin nocturnes conveyed through an iPod, but I think reading in silence 
apart from the clanking of the carriage would have been better.
We had four hours to spend in Munich - no problem at all. We marvelled at the Jesuit church of St Michael, perhaps 
the greatest Renaissance church built in northern Europe, so beautifully restored that you would not guess it had 
been left in ruins in 1944. Then we proceeded to the huge, gaunt Frauenkirche, or Church of our Lady, and finally 
the Augustinerkeller restaurant, where we witnessed a Briton making an idiot of himself. Hardly necessary to point 
out how very different and more rewarding all this felt than flying over Munich at 35,000ft.
My favourite part of the journey, even though it was accomplished in darkness, was the sleeper from Munich to 
Paris.  I have found sleeper trains romantic and exciting since I was a small boy and we used to take the overnight 
sleeper to Scotland, arriving to brisk skies, mountains and a breakfast of porridge and kippers. This sleeper was 
really quite comfortable and even when I wasn't sleeping I loved the feel of the rock, roll and soft jolt of the wheels 
over the long snaking tracks leading home. Here you can rewrite Robert Frost's lines "But I have promises to keep/ 
And  miles to go before I sleep:" miles to go as you sleep. If you travel this way, you feel the journey in your bones,  
as well as taking it in with your other senses.
Good as all this was, it could not compare with another train journey I took earlier in the year. In spring, I was lucky 
enough to be the guest of Orient Express travelling from Prague to London. I had always thought of the Orient 
Express as a rather pointless and even tasteless anachronism best suited as a set for those ersatz Agatha Christie 
thrillers. What I hadn't taken on board was the astonishing beauty of the carriages made in France and England in 
the 1920s, embellished with marquetry and other fittings by the finest craftsmen of the day including Rene Lalique 
and Rene Prou.
This was certainly slow travel, since the Orient Express never goes more than 80mph. We ground to a halt a few 
times  but in the most beautiful places, a field somewhere in Bavaria and then the valley of the river Moselle in 
eastern France. We were three or four hours late coming into Paris but it didn't matter in the least. There was even 
a grand piano in the bar - what more could you ask?

Lufthansa enjoys earnings surge

German airline Lufthansa said operating earnings rose 57 per cent to 1.1bn in the first nine months of the year after 
it carried more passengers and fully consolidated subsidiary Airline Swiss in July.
The airline said sales rose 9 per cent to 16.4 between January and September, as it continued to parry competition 
from low-cost rivals in Europe and profit from strong demand for foreign travel. The company said it expected the 
"good operating development to continue" and that full-year operating profit should hit "around 1.3bn." It had 
predicted a range of 1bn to 1.3bn in July.
A part of the performance surge came from the full consolidation of Swiss in the middle of the summer, two years 
after Lufthansa bought the carrier, which was then clawing its way back from bankruptcy. The combination saw 
Lufthansa group passenger traffic - the number of passengers multiplied by the distance they fly - rise 25 per cent 
last month, with growth particularly strong in Europe.
Lufthansa itself recorded a 3.9 per cent rise in passenger traffic last month after adding 3 per cent more capacity to 
counter low-cost rivals Ryanair and Easyjet, and long-haul rival Air France-KLM.
In the past two years, Lufthansa has added routes from non-hub airports like Hamburg to major European 
destinations,  such as Barcelona, and introduced new fares to better combat no-frills rivals.
It has also started to renew its fleet. In past months it ordered 170 long- and short-haul aircraft, including the Airbus 
380 Superjumbo and Boeing's stretched 747-8.
Lufthansa enjoys earnings surge
On Thursday, Lufthansa's chief executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber said that his group had declined to enter talks about 
a joint offer for Italy's Alitalia. He added that there was no interest in making a bid for Spanish airline Iberia, which 
Lufthansa considered to be too highly priced.
The Italian government is looking for a buyer for a 49 per cent stake in Alitalia but the German group considers the  
Italian venture too risky.

Aer Lingus is to take legal action to force Ryanair to sell its 29.4 per cent stake in the former Irish state-owned 
carrier after the European Commission indicated it would not use its powers to force a disposal.
The move follows the Commission's earlier ruling prohibiting a takeover bid by Ryanair on grounds of unfair 
competition.
Lawyers say the Commission has often forced bidders to dispose of a stake when a bid is deemed illegal under 
competition rules, but in this case, because the offer had lapsed, it allowed Ryanair to retain its stake.
Aer Lingus is to apply to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg once the Commission has published its formal 
ruling on the disposal, expected next week.
John Sharman, Aer Lingus chairman, said the company was "fully prepared to face competitive opposition on the 
runways", but Ryanair was using its shareholding to "interfere with the commercial business of Aer Lingus and  to 
further its own interests".
Alec Burnside, of Linklaters, Aer Lingus' legal advisers in Brussels, asked: "Is it desirable for Ryanair to have a 30 
per cent stake of its main rival "
The stakebuilding by Ryanair started in the days following the initial public offering of Aer Lingus last year.
But a coalition of the government's 25 per cent, a stake controlled by a workers trust and stakes acquired by a  
pilots' group and by Denis O'Brien, the telecommunications entrepreneur, stymied Ryanair's bid.
Ryanair said: "It is impossible to claim that Ryanair have any influence over them."
Aer Lingus seeks legal move on Ryanair stake
"We presume this initiative was designed to cover Aer Lingus' embarrassment at the current share price of 2.35, 
which is 20 per cent lower than Ryanair's offer of 2.80 almost one year ago."

Tiger Airways, the Singapore-based budget airline that will start flying within Australia next month, is negotiating  
with investors to establish operations in a third country as it continues to expand.
Tony Davis, chief executive, told the Financial Times that the new joint venture would most likely be majority-owned  
by local investors, although the agreement would give Tiger substantial leeway over commercial and operational 
arrangements. He would not detail the size of the mooted investment nor its location.
"The foreign ownership limits in most of Asia necessitate local partners but there is certainly plenty of interest from 
such strategic investors about creating this kind of joint venture," he said.
The negotiations underline the extent to which Tiger and rivals such as Malaysia-based AirAsia are trying to expand 
rapidly their geographic footprint to emulate the success of the largest low-cost airlines in the US and Europe. 
Tiger's leading shareholder is Singapore Airlines but another significant investor is the family of Tony Ryan, the  
recently deceased founder of Ryanair, the European low-cost carrier.
"We still have a long way to go until LCCs [low-cost carriers] are established in Asia the way they are in the US or 
Europe. But if you look at the road and rail networks in a region like south-east Asia, as a transport alternative, the 
growth opportunities for LCCs are tremendous," Mr Davis said.
Last month, Tiger created a new holding structure, Tiger Aviation, giving it "a lot more flexibility'' to form new Asian 
airline subsidiaries, as well as making it easier to raise additional funding to help cover the cost of new aircraft.
Following a recent deal with Airbus, Tiger is planning to grow its fleet from nine aircraft to 26 by the end of 2010  
and then 72 aircraft by 2016.
Tiger eyes venture in a third territory
Concerning the timing of a mooted initial public offering, Mr Davis said: "There's no immediate need to inject more 
cash in the business. So as to an IPO, it's obviously something the shareholders will consider at the appropriate 
time."
Some of the new budget airlines in Asia have opted for a mixed fleet of aircraft, as well as a two-class structure to 
attract business passengers away from the legacy carriers.
Mr Davis, however, said Tiger would remain "a purist," sticking to a fleet of Airbus A320s to help contain  costs in 
what promises to be a much more competitive Asian market. "What is becoming clear in Asia, as has been the case 
in North America and Europe, is that ultimately two or three LCCs will become pre-eminent," he said.

EasyJet climbs on upbeat forecast

EasyJet, the budget airline, has lifted profit guidance for the year, in spite of a squeeze on demand from increased  
passenger duty and rising fuel costs.
European expansion, cost-cutting and a one-off GBP11m gain from an investment in the consortium that runs the 
UK air  traffic control system will result in pre-tax profit growth at the upper end of a previously announced 40-50 per 
cent range, the carrier said on Friday.
Jeff Carr, chief financial officer, said the airline was better placed than Ryanair, its bigger rival, to cope with 
challenging market conditions because of its mix of business travellers and tourists.
Mr Carr said the company saw "opportunities throughout Europe" for further expansion, particularly in Spain and 
France.
The airline plans to increase revenue from non-flight products such as package holidays and car rentals. These 
represent less than 10 per cent of sales.
The airline's fleet now totals 137, a net increase of 15 from the previous year. EasyJet plans to reduce its reliance 
on relatively expensive leased aircraft and in the long-term to replace its 30 Boeing 737-700 models with cheaper 
Airbus counterparts.
Average ticket prices fell 6.8 per cent in the second half, although the company is not planning substantial price 
cuts over the winter.
EasyJet climbs on upbeat forecast
EasyJet, which reports its financial results in November, disclosed the upbeat forecast as it announced a 13 per 
cent rise in passenger numbers - now 37.2m across the continent - for the 12 months ended in September.
Shares in EasyJet rose 24p to close at 571lp.
Meanwhile, Aer Lingus, the Irish airline that was privatised last year, on Friday said its September passenger 
figures were up 9 per cent on a year earlier thanks to additional aircraft and a new route, but said its aircraft were 
not as full as a year ago.
On short-haul routes its load factor rose to 80.5 per cent from 80 per cent of capacity, in spite of a year-on-year 
capacity increase of 9.8 percent. The number of passengers rose 7.8 percent to 742,000.
On long-haul routes, its load factor fell to 67.9 percent from 72.8 per cent a year earlier, largely due to increased 
capacity provided by two additional aircraft. The number of passengers increased 18 per cent to 105,000. The 
airline launched the first of three new transatlantic routes, to Washington Dulles, in August.
Services to San Francisco and Orlando will begin at the end of the month.

Zoom aims high with low-fare flight plan
Zoom aims high with low-fare flight plan

Zoom Airlines has largely been flying under the radar screen of the big transatlantic carriers for the past couple of 
months, since it began its attempt to bring its own brand of low fares to the crowded London-New York market.
The latest upstart to seek to carve out a living in this lucrative but highly competitive route launched its initial  once-
a-day service between London Gatwick and New York JFK in June with relatively little fanfare, but it has big 
ambitions.
Other recent transatlantic start-up carriers have all targeted the premium business class market, with Eos Airlines 
and Maxjet Airways of the US and Silverjet of the UK launching upmarket, all-business class services.
Zoom is operating at the other end of the range in the bargain basement largely for leisure travellers. It is seeking to 
undercut the lowest economy fares offered by the big incumbent airlines led by British Airways and Virgin Atlantic 
from the UK, and American Airlines, United Airlines and Continental of the US.
The challenge to the established long-haul carriers from Zoom as a budget carrier is the first since Freddie Laker 
launched his ill-fated Skytrain from Gatwick in the late 1970s.
Many potential start-ups have looked at taking the low-cost airline business model into long-haul markets, but have 
usually shied away because of the fierce competition from the big network carriers.
Airlines such as BA, Virgin and American make the lion's share of their long-haul profits from business class 
passengers, which allows them to subsidise their lowest economy fares and fill the back of their aircraft.
Zoom aims high with low-fare flight plan
Zoom is intent on going another route, however, towards being what John Boyle, one of its founders, describes as 
"the EasyJet of the North Atlantic".
Mr Boyle believes that he can survive in the long-haul market by stripping away all the special terms and conditions  
that the network airlines impose on passengers for being able to avail themselves of the cheapest economy fares, 
just as the no-frills operators led by Ryanair and EasyJet have done in short-haul European markets.
Most importantly, Zoom has removed the need for a Saturday night stay in order to qualify for the cheap fares and it  
is also selling one-way journeys rather than insisting on a return fare with the aim of allowing travellers to fly from  
London into one city in North America and to return from another without being heavily penalised in the price.
Monitoring the pricing practices of his rivals, Mr Boyle believes that the big airlines are in lock-step in the prices they 
charge, with little variation despite the protestations about fierce competition.
He claims that Zoom fares offer savings of between 23 per cent and 76 per cent against the average of the legacy 
carriers, depending on whether travellers are staying through a Saturday night.
The airline has been developed by Mr Boyle and his brother Hugh.
The brothers, Scottish entrepreneurs and veterans of the UK travel sector, launched Zoom as a Canadian carrier 
based  in Ottawa in 2002, and have focused to date largely on developing leisure routes between the UK and 
Canada.
Zoom is majority owned by Hugh Boyle with 60 per cent while his brother holds a significant minority stake. Bank of 
Scotland's private equity division last year bought a 7.5 per cent share in the group for GBP5.7m and a small stake 
is also held by some staff.
While Zoom Airlines Inc is registered in Ottawa as a Canadian carrier and is regulated by the Canadian aviation 
authorities, a subsidiary company, Zoom Airlines Ltd, was established at Gatwick as a UK-regulated company to 
launch the UK-US routes.
International air traffic rights are closely tied to the nationality of airlines under the terms of bilateral air services 
treaties. As majority shareholder, Hugh Boyle is able to own both a UK and a Canadian airline by dint of holding 
dual UK and Canadian passports.
The brothers made their original fortune in the UK travel sector, most notably selling their Direct Holidays business 
to Airtours in 1997 for GBP80m.
Like Silverjet and Maxjet, the Zoom founders are aiming to raise outside equity to finance their future expansion and 
are working with Panmure Gordon as financial adviser for a possible listing on the Aim market as one strategic 
option.

French Catalonia: Mountains of potential
French Catalonia: Mountains of potential

The most potent symbol of Catalan identity is Mont Canigou, the mountain that sits between the French city of 
Prades  and the Spanish border. For Catalans it is their sacred mountain and has been celebrated in poetry and 
literature.
Most of the region's 10m Catalan speakers live in Spain, in an area stretching from the Pyrenees to Valencia. A  
mere 120,000 Catalan speakers live on the French side of the border in the department of Pyrenees-Orientales in 
the Languedoc-Roussillon region.
On both sides of the border the Catalans delight in their separate identity - but on the French side it is more diluted. 
Identity apart, what both the French and Spanish Catalans have in common is a strong business ethic and acumen.
Today, most of the business set-ups in French Catalonia are small-scale. Wine, agriculture and tourism are the 
mainstays of the region and its business community is keen to encourage tourism ventures of all kinds. Campsites, 
chambres d'hotes and organic wine businesses are popular with incomers to the region who are looking for a 
lifestyle change. (Collioure is typical of the seaside towns of the region. Its most famous product - if you do not 
count anchovies - is art. And that can be directly attributed to the tourist industry.)
"We have a nice combination here of weather, transport and location," says Igor Knibiehly, director of the  
departmental tourist committee for Pyrenees-Orientales. "We have good links to the rest of the south of France and  
Spain - particularly Barcelona - and London. The combination of sea and mountains make this area a great location 
for congress business and we are hoping to build on that," he says.
"This is a perfect place for seminar and meetings and incentive businesses and we are widening that."
French Catalonia: Mountains of potential
There are growing numbers of British and Irish incomers to the region as well as more Spanish Catalans. This is 
quite a turn-up for the books because when the euro was first introduced most French Catalans sought the cheaper 
prices available over the border. Now the traffic is in both directions.
Les Pyrenees-Orientales - the eastern Pyrenees - forms the southernmost tip of France and is bordered by the 
Aude to  the north, the Mediterranean to the east, Spanish Catalonia to the south and the principality of Andorra to 
the west.
No-frills airline Ryanair operates a daily service to Perpignan Rivesaltes airport from London Stansted in Essex 
(flight time just over an hour). The airport is 5km north of Perpignan, by to the route nationale and just 20 minutes 
from the Mediterranean.
Other options include Carcassonne Airport in the Aude and also Gerona/Barcelona Airports over the border (two-
and-a-half hours from Perpignan). Air France operates up to four flights a day to Perpignan.
French Catalans are quick to point out the improvements to road infrastructure in the past few years. Routes into 
the mountains are not as isolated as they used to be and it has opened more possibilities for tourist businesses. 
The service sector is another area expected to grow.
Social and economic integration between north and south Catalonia has moved on since the introduction of the 
euro but there is still an enormous imbalance in industry between the Spanish and French sides of the border.
On the Spanish side, the Catalan Investment Agency has been very successful.
The business climate that has been created is a big factor for companies choosing to locate but French Catalans 
are becoming more pro-active in offering business incentives.
The technology sector, particularly in the field of solar power, wind energy and renewable resources, has taken off.  
The Espace Enterprise Mediteranee Rivesaltes, a 250-acre enterprise park 2km from the Perpignan north highway 
exit, has  strong potential for attracting businesses that contribute to the environment.
Thanks to its 2,700 hours of sunshine and 130 days of wind per year, Pyrenees- Orientales has the potential to 
develop solar, hydraulic, geothermal and wind energies. Apart from creating hundreds of jobs, the region hopes to 
be a source of eco-industrial elements for the region.
It is worth noting that a solar furnace was built in in Odeillo 36 years ago and is thought to be the world's largest. It 
consists of an enormous satellite that captures the sun's rays at its centre using 10,000 mirrors and reaching 
temperatures of 3,000C.
The region is encouraging development of this kind of technology. It is exploring the potential and actual uses of 
solar energy for domestic purposes, as well as energy crisis solutions.
