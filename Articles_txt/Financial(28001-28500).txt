(Update) Shares were marked higher in London with most of the early upward pressure generated by the mining 
sector where Anglo American was top of the leader board.
After its memorandum of understanding with the China Development Bank to identify and develop a pipeline of 
resources mostly in China and Africa, Anglo (AAL) shares rose 146p or 5.02% rise to £30.56.
It later fell back to £29.82, up 72p, to be replaced at the top by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), up 24p to 412.75p, 
after weekend reports said if it needed to raise capital it was prepared to sell some of its assets in Bank of China.
Taylor Woodrow (TWOD) was the second biggest riser adding 10.75p to 203.75p on hopes that the Bank of 
England will cut interest rates on Thursday.
Kingfisher (KGF), up 8.3p to 159.1p, was another early winner after Deutsche Bank upgraded the shares from hold 
to buy.
ITV (ITV) added 2.99p to 79.4p on the back of bid speculation suggesting that up to three private equity groups 
might be considering a bid.
After revealing that it was in talks with Punch Taverns, Mitchells & Butlers (MAB) was at the top of the FTSE 250 
leader board, up 24.75p to 474p. Other early leaders included Kier Group, JP Morgan Indian Investment Trust and 
JKX Oil & Gas.
Profit taking hit Carphone Warehouse (CPW), down 19.5p to 320p in early trading. Others losers included Experian, 
Man Group and Sainsbury with falls ranging between 7.5p and 13p.
EasyJet (EZJ), down 35.75p to 431p, was at the top of the FTSE 250 loser board largely because of the 
disappointing trading statement from its rival Ryanair.
With the rescue bids due in today, Northern Rock (NRK) was the biggest riser on the FTSE 250, up 9.5p to 105.5p. 
Other winners included Gem Diamonds, Aquarius Platinum ands Rotork.
The FTSE 100 hit an early high of 6,067.2, up 38 points, but a lack of early buyers made these levels unsustainable 
and prices fell away and at 8.56am the index bottomed at 6,014, down 15.2.
Monday Morning Market: FTSE up on back of miners and talk of RBS sale
At 11:19, the FTSE 100 was up 16.2 points to 6,045.4. The FTSE 250 was 73.7 better at 10,260.3, the FTWSE 350 
by 10.1 to 3,153.5 and the FTSE AIM All-Share by 1.8 to 984.9.
Early trading was influenced by the overnight advances in Japan, where the Nikkei 225 was 362.54 up to 13,859.7 
and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 908.5 points to 25,032.09.
Increased trading levels in Germany last month compared to December are expected to give an early boost to 
shares in Frankfurt.
Shares are also expected to be firmer in Paris after Wall Street's strong performance on Friday and they will be 
boosted by merger and acquisition speculation.
Ahead of the Bank of England's interest rate decision on Thursday, the pound was firmer in the international money 
markets advancing from last week's closing $1.9651 to $1.9775 against the US dollar and from 1.3274 to 1.3313 
against the euro.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary today predicted the UK is heading for a recession, which "would be great for the 
aviation industry".
The airline today said its third-quarter profits fell by 27pc and warned profits for next year could decline by as much 
as 50pc.
However, Mr. O'Leary said the people would still want to fly during a recession because Ryanair's fares would come 
down.
 Mr. O'Leary said he believes that a recession would be great for the aviation industry and would get rid of 
"nonsense" environmental taxes.

Body
Davy Research today kept its full-year 2009 guidance for Ryanair intact despite what it concedes was a 'bearish' 
outlook from the airline.
This morning Ryanair delivered a lower than expected profit figure for the third quarter and warned a slump of up to 
50pc in profits for the full-year 2009.
The airline cited stubbornly high oil prices, 5pc increases in other costs, flat or falling yields, UK consumers reining 
in their spending on the back of a weakening UK economy and the strength of the euro against the UK pound.
 The company says that 'there is now a significant chance that profits may decline next year'. Ryanair's guidance 
was not specific other than on its most optimistic reading (based on flat yields and oil at USD75) profits will grow by 
6pc to E500m. On its most conservative reading (assuming current oil and 5pc yield declines) 'profits could fall by 
as much as 50pc to as low as E235m'. 'We think this is excessively bearish given a market so supply-constrained 
into next summer and with Ryanair indicating that competitors are withdrawing capacity,' Stephen Furlong, an 
analyst with Davy said.

Aer Arann extends reach in British market
Aer Arann extends reach in British market

Aer Arann has concluded the first phase of its planned expansion into the British market, with the completion of a  1 
million advertising campaign to raise awareness of its services among British customers.
Aer Arann managing director Garry Cullen said that, prior to the roll-out of the campaign last year, Aer Arann was 
not a well-known brand in Britain.
''There was probably next to zero recognition for us in Britain," he said. ''We are not a major carrier and national 
advertising spend is not within our budget, so we concentrated on particular areas with radio, metro newspapers 
and a lot of PR [public relations] stuff. It is building, but it is still an area we have to do more work in."
Last week, Aer Arann announced record passenger numbers for 2007 in excess of 1.15 million - a 10 per cent 
increase over 2006.The company's turnover also jumped by 6.5 per cent last year, to total  100 million.
''We were very happy, as we reached our targets in what was a fairly difficult year," said Cullen. ''The Ireland-Britain 
market was not as buoyant as 2005 and 2006, which was the experience of all operators, including Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus."
Aer Arann's Galway-London and Waterford-London routes both carry over 9,000 passengers each month. ''Last 
year, we concentrated a lot of effort on the Waterford and Galway routes," said Cullen.
''We also added new routes to Birmingham and Manchester out of Waterford. We are very happy with the 
developments and our services are doing very well."
Established in 1970, and bought by current owner Padraig O'Ceidigh in 1994, Aer Arann operates over 600 weekly 
flights across 40 routes in Ireland, Britain and Europe.
The company opened new corporate headquarters in Santry in Dublin last year and a new hangar at Galway. It 
employs 400 staff in both facilities an do additional operations in Dublin, Galway and Waterford.
Aer Arann extends reach in British market
Last year, Aer Arann signed  180 million contract with French manufacturer ATR, to add ten new ATR 72-500 
turboprop aircraft to its fleet in the next two years. ''They are new aircraft and offer better economics and a better 
customer experience," said Cullen.

France's union of autonomous airlines (Scara) has sent a letter to the French government accusing various 
European air carriers of sidestepping French employment laws to unfair competitive advantage, a spokesperson for 
the transport ministry confirmed following a report in Le Journal du Dimanche.
The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the letter in which Scara accuses Ireland's Ryanair, Air France 
subsidiary CityJet, US company NetJets and Switzerland's Global Jet of employing staff in France but applying the 
employment legislation of their own country.
This allows them to avoid social charges and thereby generate substantial cost-savings, the paper said.
Citing the letter, the paper said Scara, which groups together all French autonomous airlines except Air France, has 
asked French transport minister, Dominique Bussereau to investigate employment practices at the companies in 
question and apply the necessary sanctions.
A spokesperson for the transport ministry confirmed receipt of the letter.
'Scara has already alerted the State to the issue of the application of regulations by companies based in France 
and work inspectors regularly carry out checks,' the spokesperson said.

While maintaining that Alitalia's decision to cancel slots at Milan's Malpensa is not yet final, Milan Mayor Letizia 
Moratti said Friday that she is in talks with other airlines about stepping up their presence at Malpensa should 
Alitalia reduce its commitment.
Alitalia announced late Thursday it would release the Malpensa slots not in use during the summer season, from 
April through the end of October. The operator of Milan's airports SEA on Friday said was seeking €1.25 billion 
($1US.86 billion) in damages, saying the number of Alitalia flights would be reduced to 105 from 360, the ANSA and 
Apcom news agencies reported.
The move seemed to have the de facto impact of demoting Malpensa from its status as one of Alitalia's two hubs, 
as potential buyer Air France-KLM has said it intends to do if it is reaches an agreement for the government's 49.9 
percent share of the troubled airline.
"The decision taken by Alitalia must be confirmed by the transport minister; it is not necessarily final," Moratti said in 
an interview. But she said Malpensa would not be devastated if the move were confirmed.
"We would have a period of suffering, but that would be compensated by other airlines who have already said they 
are available and have expressed their interest," Moratti said. "Certainly there would be a period of crisis, but it 
would be very limited."
She declined to discuss which carriers had expressed interest, saying the discussions were confidential. RyanAir, 
which currently flies from Bergamo's Orio al Serio airport in the Milan area, has been bullish about seeking to step 
into any vacuum at Malpensa.
Moratti defended Malpensa's status as a hub, noting that one measure is the number of passengers making 
connections. At Malpensa, it is 34 percent, compared to Rome's Leonardo da Vinci international airports 26 
percent, she said.
Milan mayor says she's in talks with other airlines about raising commitment to Malpensa
She also said that Malpensa handles 500,000 tons of cargo a year, do 126,000 at Rome's international airport 
making it an attractive airport for many airlines.
"Malpensa is the true hub of Italy," Moratti said.
While Malpensa's passenger numbers grew 10 percent last year, twice the European average, Moratti noted that 
Alitalia was fourth in terms of growth at Malpensa last year, behind EasyJet, the private Italian low-cost airline 
Livingston Air and KLM.
Air France-KLM entered exclusive talks with Alitalia Jan. 15; they are expected to wrap up by mid-March. However, 
the fall of Romano Prodi's center-left government has raised concerns that the deal may fall through, weighing on 
the stock price. Alitalia shares were trading up 1.75 percent at €0.66 (US$.98) late Friday but down from over €0.80 
at the beginning of the year.
Air France CEO Jean-Cyril Spinetta has said that Alitalia's losses are due mainly to Malpensa. But Moratti said the 
logic was flawed because the heavy costs weighing on Alitalia were due to the company's decision to fly crews in 
daily from Rome to Milan and not base crews in the north.
"This is not about Malpensa, it is about Alitalia, which is badly organized," Moratti said. "If the personnel were 
people who lived here, the costs would be completely different. When Alitalia decided to make Malpensa a hub, 
they didn't reorganize the company the way they should have."

Malpensa from its status as one of Alitalia's two hubs, as potential buyer Air France-KLM has said it intends to do if 
it is reaches an agreement for the government's 49.9 percent share of the troubled airline.
Corriere della Sera put the number at 150 flights a day while the financial daily il Sole 24-Ore said that just 47 
international routes a week would remain from 181 in 2007.
"The decision taken by Alitalia must be confirmed by the transport minister; it is not necessarily final," Moratti said in 
an interview. But she said Malpensa would not be devastated if the move were confirmed.
"We would have a period of suffering, but that would be compensated by other airlines who have already said they

She declined to discuss which carriers had expressed interest, saying the discussions were confidential. RyanAir, 
which currently flies from Bergamo's Orio al Serio airport in the Milan area, has been bullish about seeking to step 
into any vacuum at Malpensa.
Speaking in Rome, Bianchi said the issue of the slots would be taken up by a round-table with officials in the 
northern Lombardy region who have been pressing the government to secure a delay in any reassignment of slots, 
the news agency ANSA reported. Moratti also said the round-table would be one place to seek a solution.
Milan mayor says she's in talks with airlines about raising commitment to Malpensa
ANSA reported that SEA, the company manages the airports in the northern Italian city, was seeking €1.25 billion 
($1US.86 billion) in damages. SEA has set aside €1 billion ($1US.49 billion) for infrastructure improvements 2007-
12, most of which would benefit Alitalia.
Moratti defended Malpensa's status as a hub, noting that one measure is the number of passengers making 
connections. At Malpensa, it is 34 percent, compared to Rome's Leonardo da Vinci international airports 26

Air France-KLM entered exclusive talks with Alitalia Jan. 15; they are expected to wrap up by mid-March. However, 
the fall of Romano Prodi's center-left government has raised concerns that the deal may fall through, weighing on 
the stock price. Alitalia shares were trading up 1.75 percent at €0.66 (US$.98) late Friday but down from over €0.80 
at the beginning of the year.
Air France CEO Jean-Cyril Spinetta has said that Alitalia's losses are due mainly to Malpensa. But Moratti said the 
logic was flawed because the heavy costs weighing on Alitalia were due to the company's decision to fly crews in 
daily from Rome to Milan and not base crews in the north.
"This is not about Malpensa, it is about Alitalia, which is badly organized," Moratti said. "If the personnel were 
people who lived here, the costs would be completely different. When Alitalia decided to make Malpensa a hub, 
they didn't reorganize the company the way they should have."

Highlight: Banks lifted the Dublin market higher this morning
Body
Banks lifted the Dublin market higher this morning as trading remained subdued ahead of today's all important US 
employment report.
At 11.00am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 123.97 points at 6788.45
Bank of Ireland was up 23c to 10.04 and AIB rose 14c to 15.02 Anglo Irish Bank climbed 32c to 9.72 and Irish Life 
and Permanent was up 19c to 10.89 
 In the construction sector, McInerney was down 1c at 1.60 and Kingspan slipped 2c to 9.30. CRH was up 83c to 
26.10 and Grafton climbed 13c to 5.38. Elsewhere, shares at no-frills airline Ryanair rose 3c to 3.83 and bookmaker 
Paddy Power climbed 48c to 19.48. Other notable movers include, DCC up 37c to 18.90 and Kerry Group up 43c to 
18.50 Elan was up 32c to 17.27 after Wyeth, Elan's partner in the development of a range of drugs for the treatment 
of Alzheimer's disease, yesterday reported a solid set of Q407 results. The company reported an 18pc increase in 
fully diluted EPS to USD0.78 (1c behind consensus) excluding "certain significant items", from a 19pc increase in 
revenue over the same period last year to USD1.0 billion Of direct interest to Elan, Wyeth reconfirmed in its results 
release that patient dosing has started in the global Phase III clinical trial programme for AAB-001 for the treatment 
of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. No further details were given or requested in the conference 
call. Also, following IFG's trading update yesterday, Goodbody has raised their earnings estimates for 2008 and 
2009 by 3pc. "Positive comments on the integration of recently acquired businesses into the International Trustee 
division and on the strong growth in the UK fee based advisory businesses lead us to increase the growth rates 
marginally for these businesses this year (which feeds through to 2009). "In addition, we have comfort on the 
outlook for stable earnings growth, given the recurring income streams that are generated by the business, 
particularly the International business, " Anna Lalor, analyst at Goodbody Research said.

Highlight: The Dublin market shook off more bad news on the U.S. economy.
Body
The Dublin market shook off more bad news on the U.S. economy in the shape of a weak jobs report. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 175.44 points at 6839.92
The US economy lost jobs in January for the first time in more than four years, a decline likely to further stoke 
recessionary fears, although the unemployment rate dipped a bit from the prior month.
 The economy lost 17,000 jobs in January, a surprise drop compared to the 58,000 jobs economists had expected 
from the survey of employer payrolls. This marks the first monthly loss in non-farm payrolls since August 2003. 
However, leading economist Jim Power has warned of further tough times ahead for the Irish equity market. 
"Shares in most Irish companies are not on the wanted lists of either domestic or international investors at the 
moment", he said. "And when you take the recent UBS warning into account it is clear that international investors 
have fallen out of love with Ireland and I can't see this turning around any time soon. In fact, I believe Irish equities 
will remain under pressure for quite some time to come." Banks lifted the index higher. Bank of Ireland was up 33c 
to 10.14 and AIB rose 25c to 15.13 Anglo Irish Bank climbed 50c to 9.90 and Irish Life and Permanent was up 75c 
to 14.45 In the construction sector, McInerney was down 1c at 1.60 and Kingspan rose 8c to 9.40. CRH was up 
E1.08c to 26.35 and Grafton climbed 23c to 5.48. Elsewhere, shares at no-frills airline Ryanair dropped 20c to 3.60 
and bookmaker Paddy Power climbed 85c to 19.85. Other notable movers include, DCC up 27c to 18.80 and Kerry 
Group up 18c to 18.35 Meanwhile, Elan was up 40c to 17.35 after Wyeth, Elan's partner in the development of a 
range of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, yesterday reported a solid set of Q407 results. The 
company reported an 18pc increase in fully diluted EPS to USD0.78 (1c behind consensus) excluding "certain 
significant items", from a 19pc increase in revenue over the same period last year to USD1.0 billion Of direct 
interest to Elan, Wyeth reconfirmed in its results release that patient dosing has started in the global Phase III 
clinical trial programme for AAB-001 for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. No 
further details were given or requested in the conference call. Also, following IFG's trading update yesterday, 
Dublin market closes week on a high
Goodbody has raised their earnings estimates for 2008 and 2009 by 3pc. "Positive comments on the integration of 
recently acquired businesses into the International Trustee division and on the strong growth in the UK fee based 
advisory businesses lead us to increase the growth rates marginally for these businesses this year (which feeds 
through to 2009). "In addition, we have comfort on the outlook for stable earnings growth, given the recurring 
income streams that are generated by the business, particularly the International business, " Anna Lalor, analyst at 
Goodbody Research said. Shares at IFG remained unchanged at 1.60. Finally, shares at drinks group C and C 
climbed 27c to 4.75 despite Greene King, the third-largest pub chain in the UK, said the recent trading environment 
has become more challenging for the pub and beer industry and expects it to remain challenging for the remainder 
of its financial year to May. Despite this, it is confident that it will meet earnings expectations. Like-for-like sales in 
its managed pubs were flat for the 38 weeks to January 20th, and group margin was ahead of last year even with 
the cost pressures being faced by the industry.

Body
The High Court of Justice of England and Wales has ruled in favour of Ryanair Holdings PLC, allowing the carrier 
the use of hanger space at Dublin Airport. The court granted Ryanair an injunction against a maintenance company 
defendant, SR Technics Ireland Ltd (SRT), preventing the defendant from evicting the carrier. 
The carrier and SRT had made an agreement providing for a 15-year use of hanger space at the airport. The court 
also ordered SRT to pay a reported £400,000 ($797,000) in legal costs incurred by the carrier, and was critical of 
both SRT and the Dublin Airport Authority, which proposed to pay SRT (EURO)5 million ($7.4 million) for 
relinquishing possession of the hanger. 
The Dublin Airport Authority responded by declaring that it will not recognize the judgment of the English court and 
will "take its own commercial decisions as to how it optimizes the value of its property assets in the best interests of 
its shareholders, the Irish government and the Irish people". 
The English court adjudicated the case because the parties chose English law to govern the underlying agreement.

held on February 1, 2008.
The air carrier offers tickets at a price 19.99 euro ($29.74) for flights from Treviso to Bremen and Dusseldorf, both in 
Germany, and from Treviso to Ireland's Shannon airport, in the period between February 15 and March 31, 2008.

passengers in 2008 and to reach 80 million passengers per year by 2012.

Carla Bruni, the singer betrothed to President Nicolas Sarkozy, was recently feted by the head of France's main 
business organisation, who said it would be "terrific" to have a first lady who was a working woman.
More evidence of Bruni's entrepreneurialism has come to light. She and Sarkozy are suing Ryanair, Europe's 
largest budget airline, for exploiting their image in an advert for cheap flights. The president wants a symbolic Euros 
1 in damages. Bruni is after Euros 500,000, because that is what she can charge as a model, according to the 
couple's lawyer. Ryanair said yesterday that it had "no intention of giving in to threats from Bruni or her ludicrous 
claims".
The company revealed it had earlier offered to settle the case by making a donation of Euros 5,000 to two charities 
of their choice.
Bruni, it appears, is holding out for a better deal.

Lawsuits by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and girlfriend Carla Bruni over budget airline Ryanair's use of their 
photo in an advertisement went to court Thursday.
Sarkozy and Bruni filed separate lawsuits that were heard together in a court session in Paris. A verdict is expected 
Tuesday.
Sarkozy is seeking one symbolic euro in damages for Ryanair's use of the image for commercial purposes without 
permission. Bruni is demanding $740,000, which the airline dismissed as "totally unjustified."
The couple's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, said that was the average fee for publishing a photo of Bruni, a model and 
singer.
For Sarkozy, "it is a question of principle," presidential spokesman David Martinon said. "As for Carla Bruni, it is her 
job. It is her image, therefore, it is normal."
Sarkozy, 53, and Bruni, 40, reportedly met in November, soon after the president's divorce from his second wife.
The ad, published Monday in the French daily Le Parisien, shows the smiling couple with a comic book-style bubble 
that has Bruni saying: "With Ryanair, all my family can come to my wedding."
Ryanair said in a statement that it sent a written apology to the president with a promise not to publish the ad again 
and an offer to donate $7,400 to his favorite charity.
The company said it made a similar offer to Bruni, but refused to agree "to any totally unjustified payment ... to Ms. 
Bruni, who has engaged in an open, widely publicized and internationally reported relationship with President 
Sarkozy."
The company justified its ad as "an honest attempt ... to reflect humorously and positively on this very public and 
publicized relationship." It said it would not give in to "threats" and called her claims of damage "ludicrous."

Bank dragged the Dublin market lower today after the Fed delivered to the markets as expected overnight, with a 
50bps reduction in interest rates to 3pc.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 91.40 points 6664.48
The news was largely welcomed by equity markets given that the accompanying statement points to further policy 
easing in store in the months ahead.
 Despite a 1.25pc decline in interest rates over the past eight days, the statement mentions that "downside risks to 
growth remain", with the Fed ready to act in "timely manner as needed". Although these downside risks are no 
longer seen as "appreciable" as in the previous statement, clearly strong concerns over growth remain, despite the 
degree of loosening to date. Even though the US Fed jumped in to avoid risks of a recession in the United States, it 
could be a case of too little too late. Bank of Ireland was down 25c to 9.76 and AIB fell 38c to 14.76, Anglo Irish 
Bank slipped 18c to 9.35 and Irish Life and Permanent dropped 55c to 10.57. In the construction sector, McInerney 
was up 4c at 1.61 and Kingspan slipped 47c to 9.32. CRH fell 57c to 25.27 and Grafton was down 1c to 5.25. 
Elsewhere, shares at no-frills airline Ryanair slipped 8c to 3.76 and bookmaker Paddy Power climbed 1c to 19.33. 
Other notable movers include Elan down 19c to 16.93, DCC down 45c to 18.53 and Kerry Group up 57c to 17.98 
Also, shares at Tullow Oil dropped 12c to 7.62 after it has sold its 11pc stake in the onshore M'Boundi field in 
Congo to the Korea National Oil Co for USD435 million in cash. The deal will involve the sale of Tullow Congo Ltd 
unit. Tullow said the sale provides it with the financial flexibility to advance its appraisal and development 
programmes in Ghana and Uganda and to continue the development of its business. Meanwhile, Brian Cowen's 
Finance Bill has brought in new measures to change the laws regarding Employee Share Ownership Plans 
(ESOPs) and Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes For ESOPs, the minister said there will be some flexibility 
provided in relation to the ten-year loan period demanded of the scheme's managers wishing to buy shares for 
employees. Where the ESOP is in a position to pay off the loan earlier, the Revenue can reduce the period on a

case-by-case basis, Mr Cowen said. Also, the maximum monthly amount that can be saved under the SAYE 
scheme is being raised from E320 to E500. Also, shares at drinks group C and C were up 11c to 4.2, it announced 
on Wednesday that John Holberry, as part of its reorganisation plan, is to take over the reigns at Magners as 
managing director in March. Mr Holberry, who takes over from Brendan McGuinness, joins the company from Coors 
Brewers, where he had been Sales Director of their off-trade (2001-2003) and on-trade operations (2003-2006) 
before being appointed director of both the off and on-trade operations in May 2006. Goodbody Research estimate 
that Magners operations in the UK represent 40pc of C and C's FY09 operating profit.

No-frills airline Ryanair said it has apologised to French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his girlfriend Carla Bruni 
after it used a photo of the couple in an ad without their permission. 
Ryanair has also offered - "as a token of its regret" - to make a donation of E5,000 to any charity of President 
Sarkozy's choice. 
Last evening however, Ryanair received legal papers from President Sarkozy and Ms Bruni under which President 
Sarkozy was seeking damages of E1, but Ms Bruni was seeking damages of E500,000. 
 Ryanair's lawyers will today tell the French Courts that they are happy to settle President Sarkozy's claim for E1 
and said it will renew its offer to make a charitable contribution of E5,000 to any charity of President Sarkozy's 
choice. In a statement, Ryanair said it "has the utmost respect for President Sarkozy and the high office which he 
holds". Ryanair's lawyers will also make a similar offer to Ms Bruni, offering damages of E1 and a contribution of 
E5,000 to any charity of Mr Bruni's choice. Ryanair said it will not however, agree to "any totally unjustified payment 
of E500,000" to Ms Bruni, who has "engaged in an open, widely publicised and internationally reported relationship 
with President Sarkozy". The advert used by Ryanair was taken from one of the French newspapers and Ryanair 
said that Ms Bruni did not make any objection to any of the remaining thousands of photographs of her which have 
appeared in over 55,000 newspapers and magazines in recent weeks. Speaking today Ryanair's Peter Sherrard 
said: "We apologised immediately and sincerely to both President Sarkozy and Ms Bruni for this advert which ran in 
Le Parisien newspaper this week. "Ryanair said it was an honest attempt by Ryanair to reflect humorously and 
positively on this very public and publicised relationship. "However Ryanair has no intention of giving in to threats 
from Ms Bruni or to her ludicrous claims and we will vigorously oppose any claim for E500,000 from this lady who 
had engaged in one of the most open, publicised and internationally reported relationships, in the world, in recent 
weeks. "We do however renew our sincere apologies to both President Sarkozy and to Ms Bruni and believe that 
an appropriate payment to a charity of their choice would be the best and most elegant way to resolve this matter".

Budget airline Ryanair has offered France's President Sarkozy and Carla Bruni damages of 1 eur and charitable 
contributions of 5,000 eur each as settlement for legal action over the use of a photo of the couple in a recent ad 
campaign.
The photograph showed the couple smiling dreamily while a caption next to Bruni reads 'With Ryanair, my whole 
family can come to my wedding'.
Lawyer Thierry Herzog said the photo was used without the couple's consent. Sarkozy is seeking a symbolic sum of 
1 eur in damages while Bruni is demanding 500,000 eur for violation of their right to privacy.
Ryanair said today it had previously written to Sarkozy's office apologising for any offence caused, and it offered to 
make a donation of 5,000 eur to charity.
The airline said its lawyers will today tell the French courts that it is happy to settle the claim for 1 eur and it will 
renew its offer of a payment to charity, and it will make a similar offer to Bruni.
Ryanair's spokesman Peter Sherrard said the company had apologised to both Sarkozy and Bruni over the ad, 
which it said intended to reflect 'humorously and positively' on their very public and publicised relationship.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his girlfriend Carla Bruni are suing Irish low-cost airline Ryanair after it used 
a photo of the couple in an ad without their permission.
The ad published in the French daily Le Parisien shows the smiling couple with a bubble coming from Bruni saying,

Sarkozy, 53, has hinted that a wedding with Bruni, 40, is in the future, though the couple has not announced a date. 
They reportedly began dating in November, about a month after Sarkozy's divorce.
Sarkozy and Bruni filed separate lawsuits against Ryanair, according to court documents obtained by The 
Associated Press. A hearing was scheduled for today. Sarkozy is asking for one symbolic euro in damages. Bruni, 
a former model, is demanding USD740,000 because that is the average sum she receives for the use of her image 
in France, said the couple's lawyer, Thierry Herzog.

An advertisement portraying a scantily clad schoolgirl seductively twirling her hair is offensive, a British watchdog 
agency said Wednesday in demanding that low-cost airline Ryanair not run it again.
Ryanair Holdings PLC said the ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority was absurd and the airline had no 
intention of honoring it.
The agency said the ad's headline "HOTTEST back to school fares" combined with the model's pose in an empty 
classroom "appeared to link teenage girls with sexually provocative behavior."
The ad ran last summer in three newspapers.
The agency said the advertisement was likely to cause "serious or widespread offense" and demanded Ryanair not 
run it again.
Ryanair spokesman Peter Sherrard said in a statement that many British newspapers regularly run pictures of 
topless or partially dressed women.
"It is remarkable that a picture of a fully clothed model is now claimed to cause 'serious or widespread offense,'" 
Sherrard said. "This isn't advertising regulation, it is simply censorship."
The authority said the newspapers which originally ran the ad have agreed not to carry it again. The agency has no 
enforcement powers, but it can refer advertisers to Britain's Office of Fair Trading for legal action.
The complaint comes two days after French President Nicolas Sarkozy's spokesman said the president plans to 
take legal action against Ryanair for using a photo of him and girlfriend Carla Bruni in another advertisement.
That ad, published Monday in the French daily Le Parisien, shows the smiling couple with a comic book speech 
bubble coming from Bruni's head saying: "With Ryanair, all my family can come to my wedding."

Last month, the airline ran afoul of Spain's government-run Women's Institute, which complained about Ryanair's 
2008 calendar and called it sexist. The calendar featured bikini-clad flight attendants blowing suggestively into a 
lifejacket and washing a plane.
Ryanair said proceeds from sales of the calendar went to charity, and that the women had posed voluntarily.

An advertisement portraying a scantily clad schoolgirl seductively twirling her hair is offensive, a British watchdog 
agency said Wednesday in demanding that low-cost airline Ryanair not run it again.
Ryanair Holdings PLC said the ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority was absurd and the airline had no 
intention of honoring it.
The agency said the ad's headline "HOTTEST back to school fares" combined with the model's pose in an empty 
classroom "appeared to link teenage girls with sexually provocative behavior."
The ad ran last summer in three newspapers.
The agency said the advertisement was likely to cause "serious or widespread offense" and demanded Ryanair not 
run it again.
Ryanair spokesman Peter Sherrard said in a statement that many British newspapers regularly run pictures of 
topless or partially dressed women.
"It is remarkable that a picture of a fully clothed model is now claimed to cause 'serious or widespread offense,'" 
Sherrard said. "This isn't advertising regulation, it is simply censorship."
The authority said the newspapers which originally ran the ad have agreed not to carry it again. The agency has no 
enforcement powers, but it can refer advertisers to Britain's Office of Fair Trading for legal action.
The complaint comes two days after French President Nicolas Sarkozy's spokesman said the president plans to 
take legal action against Ryanair for using a photo of him and girlfriend Carla Bruni in another advertisement.
That ad, published Monday in the French daily Le Parisien, shows the smiling couple with a comic book speech 
bubble coming from Bruni's head saying: "With Ryanair, all my family can come to my wedding."

Highlight: Shares on the Dublin market ended higher today
Body
Shares on the Dublin market ended higher today despite renewed fears of a recession in the United States.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 35.81 points at 6755.88. 
The US Commerce Department said the US economy was a fraction off technical recession in final quarter of last 
year.
 The world's biggest economy slowed more dramatically than expected in the final three months of last year as 
housing posted its worst contraction in a quarter century, exports pulled back and inflation picked up steam. The 
economy grew at a 0.6pc annualised pace in the fourth quarter, half the expected 1.2 pct pace of economists That's 
down from 4.9pc in the third quarter. The 0.6pc rate matched the first quarter of 2007, both of which were the lowest 
rates since the fourth quarter of 2002 Stephen Stanley at RBS Greenwich Capital found the figure even more 
unsettling. 'A 0.6pc annualised advance is too close for comfort given the normal scope of revisions to the initial 
estimate. The Commerce Department is making guesses about a lot of the December data, most notably 
inventories and foreign trade. Unfortunately, my first impression is that their assumptions for December trade and 
inventories data are far too optimistic,' he said. Banks were the worst performers of the day after Europe's biggest 
bank posted an additional USD4 billion in write-downs. UBS reported fourth-quarter net loss of 12.5 billion Swiss 
francs (USD11.4 billion) was almost double what analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were estimating, and brings the 
total decline for the year to about 4.4 billion francs, the Zurich-based bank said. Bank of Ireland was down 7c to 
9.90 and AIB fell 27c to 14.83, Anglo Irish Bank slipped 17c to 9.18 and Irish Life and Permanent climbed 37c to 
11.18. In the construction sector, McInerney was down 3c to 1.57 and Kingspan slipped 14c to 9.98. CRH fell 22c to 
25.93 and Grafton was down 13c to 5.25. Elsewhere, shares at no-frills airline Ryanair slipped 4c to 3.82 and 
bookmaker Paddy Power dropped 46c to 18.51. Other notable movers include Elan up 23c to 16.70, FBD up 5c to 
28.25 and ICG up 15c to 20.15 Shares at Independent News and Media fell 8c to 2.27 despite Jagran Prakashan, 
the Indian newspaper publisher in which Independent News and Media has a 21pc stake, reporting profits of E4.5 
ISEQ higher ahead of Fed rate decision
million for the third quarter, a rise of almost 47pc. Revenues were up 29pc to E34.8 million, with advertising revenue 
growing by 29pc to E22.9 million. The Indian company publishes Dainik Jagran, India's largest read daily 
newspaper with 53.6 million readers. "These strong results support INM's continued investment in this emerging 
market and also highlight the diversity of its global media investments," according to Conor Duffy, analyst at Davy 
Research. Smurfit Kappa saw its shares rising 6c to 8.76 as price increases have been announced (and in most 
cases implemented) for a number of different paper grades in the US. "These have been driven by a combination of 
higher input costs and strong demand. This is positive for the European sector, including companies such as 
Smurfit Kappa Group (SKG)," said Barry Dixon, analyst at Davy Research said.

President Nicolas Sarkozy and his girlfriend Carla Bruni are taking budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC to court 
over a photo of the couple featured in a recent ad campaign, their lawyer said.
The photograph showed the couple smiling dreamily while a caption next to Bruni reads 'With Ryanair, my whole 
family can come to my wedding'.
Lawyer Thierry Herzog said the photo was used without the couple's consent and a Paris court is to hear the 
complaint on Thursday.
Sarkozy is seeking a symbolic sum of 1 eur in damages while Bruni is demanding 500,000 eur from Ryanair for 
violation of their right to privacy.
Earlier today, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld 13 complaints over a Ryanair newspaper 
advert depicting women dressed as schoolgirls. The watchdog ruled the ad 'appeared to link teenage girls with 
sexually provocative behaviour' and that it was likely to cause offence.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his girlfriend Carla Bruni are suing low-cost airline Ryanair after it used a 
photo of the couple in an ad without their permission, their lawyer said Wednesday.
The ad published Monday in the French daily Le Parisien shows the smiling couple with a bubble coming from Bruni 
saying, "With Ryanair, all my family can come to my wedding."
Sarkozy, 53, has hinted that a wedding with Bruni, 40, is in the future, though the couple has not announced a date. 
They reportedly began dating in November, about a month after Sarkozy's divorce.
Sarkozy and Bruni filed separate lawsuits against Ryanair, according to court documents obtained by The 
Associated Press. A hearing was scheduled for Thursday.
Sarkozy is asking for one symbolic euro in damages. Bruni, a former model, is demanding $740,000 because that is 
the average sum she receives for the use of her image in France, said the couple's lawyer, Thierry Herzog.
A call to Ryanair's corporate headquarters Wednesday night was not immediately returned. Ryanair Holdings PLC 
has said the ad was a "humorous comment on a matter of great public interest in France. We apologize sincerely 
for any offense caused."

The value of Irish shares climbed by more than 1.1pc today amid hopes that another interest-rate cut can avert a 
recession in the US.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 78.43 points at 6720.07.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy body, has begun a two-day meeting on interest 
rates. Expectations are for the FOMC to announce a half-percentage point cut in its key interest rate tomorrow.
 Also, Jose Manuel Barroso said the EU's economy 'is not completely immune' to any downturn in the US, but it is 
not facing a recession. Speaking at a conference ahead of this afternoon's meeting of Europe's G8 members in 
London, Barroso reiterated that the European Commission is set to lower its euro zone growth projections next 
month in its next set of economic forecasts. He conceded that 'yes there is turbulence in the financial markets' and 
that investor confidence has been hit but insisted that in Europe 'there is no need to rush for the life boats' He called 
on companies to disclose any losses as a result of the market turmoil as promptly and fully as possible. Barroso 
said the EU is better placed to weather the current crisis than it has been in the past. 'Nobody is speaking about a 
recession in Europe,' he said. Banks drove the index higher. Bank of Ireland was up 13c to 9.98 and AIB fell 28c to

President Nicolas Sarkozy has put a lot of faith in the low-cost airline revolution to shake up the French economy 
and open up the country further to tourism. But perhaps not for long.
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, yesterday ran a cheeky advertisement in a French newspaper featuring 
Sarkozy and Carla Bruni, his Italian-born paramour/fiance/wife (take your pick.) A bubble appears from Bruni's 
mouth: "With Ryanair, now my whole family can come to my wedding."
The Elysee is considering suing Ryanair for abuse of the president's image. Sarkozy is happy to promote the cause 
of cheap flights. But not like this.

French president Sarkozy seeks legal action against Ryanair over ad photo

French President Nicolas Sarkozy has asked his lawyer to take legal action against low-cost airline Ryanair for 
using a photo of him and girlfriend Carla Bruni in an advertisement, a spokesman said Monday.
The Ryanair ad, published Monday in the French daily Le Parisien, shows the smiling couple with a comic book 
speech bubble coming from Bruni's saying: "With Ryanair, all my family can come to my wedding."
Sarkozy adviser Franck Louvrier said the French leader is requesting the immediate removal of the ad, although it 
was not immediately clear if he would also seek damages. He said Sarkozy's office considers the ad "an improper 
use of the president's image."
Ryanair Holdings PLC, in a statement, said: "It was a humorous comment on a matter of great public interest in 
France. We apologize sincerely for any offense caused."
The romance between the recently divorced president and the supermodel-turned-singer has captured headlines 
since they went public with their relationship in December.
Sarkozy, who turned 53 on Monday, has hinted that marriage is on the cards with Bruni, 40, though he has not 
revealed a date.
It is not the first time Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, has used politicians' likenesses without permission. 
The company has used photos of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis 
Rodriguez Zapatero in past ads.
The Irish budget airline last year reportedly settled a lawsuit filed by Sweden's ex-Prime Minister Goran Persson out 
of court after using Persson's photo picture without his consent.

Shares on the Dublin market began the week in negative territory as recession fears once again hit equity markets 
worldwide.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 119.07 points at 6641.64
After one of the most eventful weeks in the markets in living memory last week, three important events are likely to 
ensure another exciting few days, according to Goodbody Research. With no decisions on interest rates in Europe 
until next week, the US takes centre stage once again. Markets have already priced in a further aggressive cut by 
the Fed. It makes its decision this Wednesday, with the median expectation for a 50bps reduction in rates. The 
decision to cut aggressively last week was, more than likely, triggered by sharp declines in equity markets globally, 
so much may depend on the performance of the equity market in the early part of the week. Banks drove the index 
lower, Bank of Ireland was down 32c to 9.75 and AIB fell 70c to 15.28, Anglo Irish Bank dropped 60c to 9.28 and 
Irish Life and Permanent slipped 60c to 10.37. Global brokers, UBS, has cut its rating on Ireland's top banks, saying 
the slowdown in the Irish economy will hurt the country's financial sector. AIB and Anglo Irish were cut to "sell" from 
"neutral" by Ross Curran and other analysts at UBS in London. Bank of Ireland, the country's second-biggest lender 
by market value, was cut to "neutral" from "buy". "We believe there is a circa 30pc downside risk to commercial 
property values in Ireland to get yields back to historic levels, and that pre-supposes that rents are able to be 
maintained at current levels,'' Mr Curran said in report published today. "This presents a significant risk to earnings 
over the next two years for the Irish banks," he warned. Construction shares fared little better. McInerney was down 
7c to 1.53 and Kingspan fell 22c to 9.80. CRH was down 41c to 25.19 and Grafton slipped 15c to 5.05. Elsewhere, 
shares at no-frills airline Ryanair slipped 19c to 3.72 and bookmaker Paddy Power was down 35c to 18.29. Other

Higher charges for Ryanair passengers with infants
Higher charges for Ryanair passengers with infants
Sunday Business Post

Length: 281 words
Body
People travelling with infants on Ryanair flights face higher charges than other passengers, as they are excluded 
from using the airline's free online check-in option.
Last week, Ryanair announced that it was increasing checked-in baggage and airport check-in fees with immediate 
effect for all new bookings. The charge for a checked-in bag booked online increased from  6to  9,while airport 
check-in fees increased from  3 to  4. Passengers who check in online and who travel with hand luggage only are 
not charged.
However, Ryanair excludes certain passengers, including passengers travelling with infants, from checking in 
online, thus forcing them to pay the higher charge.
This policy may represent a breach of the Equal Status Act 2000 on family status grounds.
''There are grounds under section five of the Equal Status Act 2000 in relation to non-discrimination in the provision 
of goods and services," said James Doorley, chairman of the Consumers' Association.
''I am not aware of any such case having been taken concerning family status and, until such time as that has 
happened, we cannot say for certain if the Ryanair policy and charges could be challenged."
However, a spokesman for Ryanair said the policy was ''positively discriminating in favour of infants as they do not 
pay any fare''. He said that infants travelling on Ryanair flights paid a  15 administration fee to travel on any flight. 
This is an increase from  10.
To date, neither the Equality Authority nor the National Consumer Agency has received any complaints on this 
matter. A spokesman for the Equality Authority said it was unable to comment on this specific case as there was no 
precedent for the circumstances.

CAA plans Stansted price shake-up
CAA plans Stansted price shake-up
Financial Times (London, England)
January 26, 2008 Saturday
London Edition 1

Section: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. 5

Byline: By KEVIN DONE
Body
The Civil Aviation Authority is proposing radical reforms to the price control regime for London Stansted airport 
following ministers' embarrassing rebuff of its original plan to remove the airport entirely from price regulation.
Last week Ruth Kelly, transport secretary, rejected analysis from the CAA, official adviser to the government on 
aviation issues, that claimed Stansted no longer had the monopoly power to justify capping charges levied on 
airlines using the airport.
Defiantly challenging the Department for Transport's conclusions, the CAA sought yesterday to assert its official 
role as the "UK's independent aviation regulator."
It repeated that its analysis that Stansted, the third largest UK airport, did "not currently enjoy a sufficiently strong 
market position that would normally be associated with the need to apply price caps."
It said: "There is some uncertainty about how this position might change. The conclusions drawn by the government 
and the CAA from the available evidence differ. The government considers that it is more likely than not that 
Stansted will acquire substantial market power in the future, while the CAA considers that the airport is not likely to 
do so."
It said its own data indicated that even if Stansted's market position were to strengthen, competition law would 
constrain its conduct and mitigate the risk that airport users could be subject to market abuse.
Deepening the rift with the transport department, the CAA openly rejected Ms Kelly's recent assertion that 
continuing price controls were needed at Stansted to protect consumers.
It said that previous price caps at Stansted had not had a significant impact on the prices actually charged by the 
airport or its investment in capacity and service. Normal commercial and competitive pressures had protected 
passengers and airlines, it said.
The CAA said the traditional approach to setting price caps could "distort investment decisions and undermine the 
development of a competitive airports market."
CAA plans Stansted price shake-up
The government was subject to fierce lobbying by airlines over the CAA proposal to remove price controls at 
Stansted, in particular from Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading operators at Stansted, which have attacked the CAA's 
performance as economic regulator.
The CAA said yesterday that under the current price cap regime airlines using the airport might face incentives to 
oppose efficient investment in additional capacity, in order to reduce the airport's costs and lower the level of the 
price cap.
BAA, the owner of Stansted, is expected to apply soon for planning permission to build a controversial second 
runway and terminal at Stansted, doubling capacity, a move that has been strongly supported by the government 
but fiercely opposed by local authorities and environmental and residents groups.

Shares of Irish airline Ryanair Holdings PLC declined on Friday and helped pull the Nasdaq 100 down, as investors

On the gaining side, Amgen Inc. rose $2.02, or 4.4 percent, to $48.14, as investors concentrated on market 
potential for the biotechnology company's osteoporosis drug candidate.
Shares of mining equipment maker Joy Global Inc. gained $2.20, or 4 percent, to $56.99, as the price of gold hit an

Highlight: Shares on the Dublin market closed the week lower.
Body
Shares on the Dublin market closed the week lower despite a successful year for the Irish exchange even with the 
difficult market conditions of recent months.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 52.99 points at 6760.71
The value of equities traded on the Irish Stock Exchange [ISE] during 2007 totalled E199 billion - a rise of 54pc on 
the 2006 figure (E129 billion). The ISE business review of 2007 said that average daily turnover for 2007 was E784 
million, strongly ahead of the 2006 average of E511 million. The latter half of 2007 was a period of particular 
turbulence in world financial markets. Following three years in which the ISEQ outperformed many world 
benchmark indices, 2007 saw it decline by 26pc, it said. This followed a strong start in early 2007 where the ISEQ 
overall reached its lifetime high of 10,041 [21st February 2007]. A number of factors drove the increase in trading 
volumes. These included the attractiveness of the Exchange's electronic trading platform both technically and on 
price and its ability to continue to gather order flow from new sources, both of these are part of the strategic focus of 
the Exchange for some time, it said. The increased market volatility during the year also had an impact. The actual 
number of transactions in equities being undertaken on the market during 2007 increased to over 1.7 million 
transactions, it said. This represented a 92pc increase compared to the previous year [901,000]. Companies 
admitted to trading during 2007 raised more than E6.6 billion on the market during the year, a 79pc increase on 
2006. Ten new companies were admitted to trading on the Exchange in 2007. There was one addition to the Main 
Market, Smurfit Kappa Group, which raised E4.1 billion and nine companies joined the Irish Enterprise Exchange 
(IEX). These IEX entrants covered a variety of industry sectors -pharmaceuticals, technology, food, software and 
investment and included two Northern Ireland companies. The new IEX companies raised E689 million in aggregate 
on IEX. There were 30 companies on the IEX market at the year end. Meanwhile, banks drove the index higher, 
Bank of Ireland was up 17c to 10.15 and AIB rose 27c to 16.02, Anglo Irish Bank climbed 25c to 10.25 and Irish Life 
and Permanent was up 5c to 11.25. In the construction sector, McInerney was unchanged at 1.57 and Kingspan fell 
36c to 10.12. CRH was down 29c to 25.28 and Grafton climbed 8c to 5.41. Elsewhere, shares at no-frills airline 
ISEQ lower after rollercoaster week
Ryanair slipped 24c to 3.81 and bookmaker Paddy Power climbed 5c to 19.50. Other notable movers include Elan 
down 21c to 16.00, FBD up 30c to 28.00 and Smurfit Kappa down 24c to 8.36. Shares at Qualceram Shires were 
unchanged at 0.90 after reports that the company is expected to complete the sale of its 13-acre site in Arklow, for 
a net consideration E30 million. Whilst originally announced in September 2007, completion has been delayed due 
to clarification of access to the site, which has now been resolved. The company has indicated that the net 
proceeds (c. E24 million after tax and relocation costs) will be used to pay down debt, which, in our estimates, will 
leave the company in a net cash position in the region of E10 million.

The advancement of the human race depends on unreasonable people, the playwright George Bernard Shaw said 
in his Maxims for Revolutionists at the end of Man and Superman : "The reasonable man adapts himself to the 
world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the 
unreasonable man."
Entrepreneurs have often been seen by their contemporaries as unreasonable. Think of Henry Ford, paying 
workers twice the going rate to mass produce identical black cars by the million. Or the pioneers behind low-cost 
airlines such as Southwest Airlines and Ryanair who launched discount flights with none of the frills offered by 
traditional carriers. Or Sir James Dyson, inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, who had to create his own 
company to make it.
John Elkington, founder of UK-based think-tank Sustain-Ability, and Pamela Hartigan of the Schwab Foundation for 
Social Entrepreneurship, argue that humankind's future now depends on one particular new group of unreasonable 
people. They are the social entrepreneurs striving to solve the knotty economic, social and environmental problems 
facing the modern world.
These pioneers are "disrupting existing industries, value chains and business models" to find solutions to poverty 
and hunger, the threat of global pandemics and climate change. More important for Financial Times readers, their 
skills must be harnessed by conventional businesses if they are to adapt to the risks and opportunities that now 
face the world.
This is not often easy, precisely because such people are, well, unreasonable. They are usually impatient with 
bureaucracies and prepared to take big risks to tackle seemingly intractable problems. Their goals of sustainable 
development and social justice appear to challenge existing ways of doing business. Their solutions are often small-
scale, tailor-made and dependent on informal networks alien to the modern corporation.
Yet the most successful, identified in this book, have changed for the better the lives of hundreds of thousands or 
even millions of people.
Single-minded about changing the market system
One of the best-known is Muhammed Yunus, the Nobel prize-winning founder of Grameen Bank, which pioneered 
microfinance and inspired imitators around the world. He has now created new businesses, such as 
Grameenphone, which built the largest cellular network in Bangladesh with the Village Phone Program to provide 
access to telecommunications in the countryside.
Victoria Hale's OneWorld Health develops new drugs for diseases that affect the world's poorest people, such as 
leishman-iasis. David Green's Aurolab has become one of the largest manufacturers of eye lenses used to deal 
with cataracts, selling for less than Dollars 4 lenses that would cost Dollars 150 in developed countries. Nicholas 
Negroponte of Massachusetts Institute of Technology is behind a Dollars 100 laptop that would be affordable for the 
poorest young people on the globe.
Many big companies have already grasped the environmental and social challenge. Large banks such as HSBC, 
Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are among those working to reduce their carbon footprints and finance new 
technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Retailers such as Wal-Mart of the US and the UK's Marks & 
Spencer are working with suppliers to ensure products are made ethically and with less environmental impact.
But few have so far addressed the greatest opportunities that lie among the 4bn people who live on less than 
Dollars 2 a day - the so-called "base of the pyramid". Their purchasing power is Dollars 5,000bn a year according to 
the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank. And there is money to be made in 
meeting their needs - something the most successful social entrepreneurs emphasise in seeking resources to scale 
up operations.
The aim of this book is to help conventional businesses work with those entrepreneurs and to learn from the way 
they work.
The authors are notable in seeing no clash between the ends social entrepreneurs are seeking to achieve and the 
market system.
As a book, it is far from satisfactory. Written in the leaden style of many US business magazines, it cries out for 
more colourful accounts of the heroes it writes about and how they overcame obstacles. It also mixes true 
entrepreneurs such as those above with campaigners such as Peter Eigen of Transparency International and Bob 
Massie, who launched the Global Reporting Initiative. The latter have made an impact through their ingenuity and 
single-mindedness, but can hardly be described as entrepreneurs.
Yet there is no doubting the validity of the message. An increasingly crowded world is full of danger and challenges. 
The market system can solve those problems far more effectively than government action - provided the 
businesses that operate within it learn from these unreasonable people.

Highlight: Banks helped the Dublin market gain over 300 points in morning trade.
Body
 Banks helped the Dublin market make large gains in morning trade, boosted by an overnight rally on Wall Street. 
At 11.20m, the ISEQ index of Irish shares were up 332.27 points at 6822.30
Bank of Ireland was up 55c to 9.75 and AIB rose 66c to 15.01, Anglo Irish Bank climbed 66c to 15.01 and Irish Life 
and Permanent was up 86c to 11.79. 
 In the construction sector, McInerney was up 2c at 1.55 and Kingspan rose 50c at 10.50. CRH was up E1.08 to 
25.43 and Grafton climbed 24c to 5.19. Elsewhere, shares at no-frills airline Ryanair rose 25c to 4.25 and 
bookmaker Paddy Power dropped 10c to 20.00 Other notable movers include FBD up 55c to 27.75 and DCC up 
43c to 17.20 Shares at Irish pharmaceutical company Elan climbed 54c to 16.49 after Abbott Laboratories reported 
strong growth in Tricor and Humira, which is of interest to Elan investors. The former utilises Elan's nanosystems 
drug delivery technology, while the latter is competing against Tysabri as a biologic therapy for Crohn's Disease. 
Both reported strong growth in Q4. Tricor revenues advanced by 20.5pc to USD392m. Elan receives a c.5pc royalty 
on this product, equivalent to USD19.6m or 9.5pc of our Q4 revenue forecast for Elan. Double-digit growth is again 
expected by Abbott for 2008. Humira revenues rose by 53.9pc to USD954m. It is indicated for five separate 
disorders, but the company noted that its Crohn's launch in 2007 is 'proceeding well' and that it has garnered in 
excess of 30pc market share (Remicade is its competitor while Tysabri soon will be). It has benefited from the fact 
that it is the only self-administered biologic in the Crohn's market. The company expects total sales for Humira of 
USD4bn in 2008, its largest product by a distance. Also, shares at C and C group rose 5c to 4.70 after Pernod 
Ricard recorded H1 organic growth of 10.1pc, which included growth of 17pc in premium spirits. Within this, 
Jameson Irish whiskey saw organic sales growth of 23pc, of which 16pc was volume increases. The product 
appears to have done particularly well in North America. C and C's Tullamore Dew Irish whiskey brand is its leading 
growth product with its International spirits Division.

Highlight: Around E4 billion was added to the value of Irish shares today.
Body
Around E4 billion was added to the value of Irish shares today led by the the banking big guns. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 323.67 points at 6813.70
Shares at Smurfit Kappa climbed 53c to 8.55 despite Goldman Sachs slashing its forecasts and stock rating for the 
paper and packaging giant.
 The broker's said in a note that SKG's earnings will halve over the next two years as the group struggles against a 
weak economic environment, continued lack of pricing power and rising raw material and energy costs. The broker 
has slashed 18pc off its forecasts for SKG for this year and 31pc off what it had pencilled in for next year. It now 
sees the group's earnings, before interest and tax (EBIT), sliding from E633.4m in 2007 to E414.3m in 2009. SKG's 
earnings per share (EPS) should halve over the same period to 60c, it said. It has lowered its recommendation on 
SKG's stock from "buy" to "neutral", and has also taken a red pen to its earnings and ratings for a number of rivals, 
including DS Smith and Rexam. Banks drove the index higher, Bank of Ireland was up 70c to 9.90 and AIB surged 
E1.19 to 15.54, Anglo Irish Bank climbed 74c to 9.85 and Irish Life and Permanent was up 45c to 11.38. In the 
construction sector, McInerney was up 5c at 1.58 and Kingspan rose 50c at 10.50. CRH was up E1.45 to 25.81 and 
Grafton climbed 35c to 5.30. Elsewhere, shares at no-frills airline Ryanair rose 10c to 4.10 and bookmaker Paddy 
Power dropped 65c to 19.45 Other notable movers include FBD up 60c to 27.80, DCC up 45c to 18.50 and Iona up 
22c to 1.67. Shares at Irish pharmaceutical company Elan climbed 31c to 16.26 after Abbott Laboratories reported 
strong growth in Tricor and Humira, which is of interest to Elan investors. The former utilises Elan's nanosystems 
drug delivery technology, while the latter is competing against Tysabri as a biologic therapy for Crohn's Disease. 
Both reported strong growth in Q4. Tricor revenues advanced by 20.5pc to USD392 million. Elan receives a c.5pc 
royalty on this product, equivalent to USD19.6 million or 9.5pc of our Q4 revenue forecast for Elan. Double-digit 
growth is again expected by Abbott for 2008. Humira revenues rose by 53.9pc to USD954 million. It is indicated for

Shares on the Dublin market were slightly down at midday, buoyed by a share surge by Tullow Oil and CRH. 
At 11.30am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 16.64 points at 6480.23 
Tullow's trading statement this morning shows that group oil production in 2007, at 73,100 boepd, while post-hedge 
realised product prices, at USD63/bbl for oil and 38p/therm for gas, where ahead of estimates of USD60 and 35.9p 
respectively. Total revenue for 2007 was £620m versus Davy Research's forecast of £589m.

The Dublin market fell in tandem with markets in Europe today, which pulled back after ECB chief Jean-Claude 
Trichet dampened hopes of a rate cut. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 6.84 points at 6490.03
Bourses across the continent had started brightly, adding to the gains they made yesterday on the back of the

Highlight: Ryanair is increasing checked-in baggage and airport check-in fees.
Body
No-frills airline Ryanair today said that is increasing checked-in baggage and airport check-in fees with immediate 
effect for all new bookings.
For all bookings made from today onwards, Ryanair's checked in baggage fee will increase from E6 to E9 per bag 
and the airport check-in fee will increase from E3 to E4. 
The airline says it wants to encourage more passengers to check in online and travel with just carry-on luggage in 
order to cut the number of airport check-in desks it uses and the number of handling staff it employs. Speaking 
today, Ryanair's head of communications Peter Sherrard said that these will not be the last increases in fees. "They 
will continue to increase over time until we reach our objective of persuading at least 50pc of all Ryanair 
passengers to travel with hand luggage only, use our free web check-in service and avoid airport check-in queues," 
he said.

UK smaller companies rallied from a day of lows to edge slightly higher at the close, lifted by a revival among the 
blue chips, with Fiberweb gaining 30 pct on bid hopes.
At the close, the FTSE Small Cap index was 1.90 points up on 3,079.90, having fallen as low as 3,002.70 earlier 
today, while the FTSE 100 index rose 161.90 points to 5,740.10.
Fiberweb rose 14 pence to 60 pence, as it said it is in talks with Tel Aviv-listed Avgol on a possible offer for the 
company, prompting Dresdner Kleinwort to downgrade the stock to 'hold' from 'buy' while upping its price target to 
90 pence on valuation grounds.
The broker said the offer is significantly in excess of the level at which the shares have been trading in recent 
weeks.
GW Pharmaceuticals extended gains, up 7 pence to 74-1/2 pence, following its trading update, which prompted 
Investec to keep 'buy' on the stock.
Across the sector, Protherics rose 3-1/2 pence to 53 pence, as it said AstraZeneca has treated the first patient in its 
expanded phase 2 programme of CytoFab in severe sepsis, and that it expects to report the first study in about 12 
months.
Reacting, Seymour Pierce kept 'buy' on the stock, saying the long-awaited start of the trial means Protherics can 
shift its focus to its other development programmes.
Elsewhere, A&J Mucklow Group took on 50-1/4 pence to 358-1/4 pence, ahead of its interim results next month, 
while Ryanair edged up 0.35 of a penny to 4 pence as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism said low-cost 
airlines captured 41.7 pct of the Spanish market share in December, up 35.4 pct from a year earlier.
Hertford International ticked up 0-1/2 a penny to 30-1/4 pence as Allianz Insurance raised its holding in the 
company to 8.79 pct from 5.74 pct.
Hertford has also signed a contract to supply 10,000 CrewCard pre-paid debit cards to Easy Debit Card Ltd.
Financial details were not disclosed.
UK small caps nudge slightly higher at close; Fiberweb top riser on bid hopes
Jetion Holdings nudged up 3 pence to 124 pence as its non-executive director Gabriel Kow purchased 15,612 
shares at 124.28 pence each, lifting his stake in the company to 42,102 shares or about 0.06 pct, while Trust 
Property Management stayed 0-1/2 a penny up on 14-1/2 pence, as director Benjamin Mire snapped up 200,000 
shares at a price of 17 pence apiece, taking his holding to 29.33 pct of the equity.
Completing a hat-trick of share-buying, China Biodiesel rose 2 pence to 21 pence as a director of the company 
purchased 90,000 ordinary shares, lifting his stake to 0.19 per cent.
DM stayed 1 penny higher on 15-1/5 pence as it said it sees full-year pretax profits and revenues to be ahead of 
market expectations, following continued strong growth across all key areas.
But, turning to the losers, Humberts Group shed 7-1/2 pence to 7-3/4 pence -- nearly half its value -- on its news 
late yesterday that it expects a 'small' current year first quarter loss and an overall first-half loss, prompting 
Panmure Gordon to cut its forecasts on the group while keeping 'sell'.
EBTM lost 1-1/2 pence to 2-3/4 pence -- a 35 pct decline -- after warning that full-year results will fall 'materially 
short' of its previous expectations as consumer spending slows in 2008, although the online fashion retailer swung 
to a maiden first-half pretax profit from a loss the year before.
However, management is adopting a cautious outlook for the wholesale division in 2008, given current consumer 
sentiment on the high street.
Elsewhere, Tadpole Technology shed 0-1/2 a penny to 2.88 pence, as it posted a full-year pretax loss, albeit 
narrowed to 0.34 mln stg from 6.84 mln a year ago, while Management Consulting stayed 1 penny off on 32-1/4 
pence, as its in-line trading update continued to be overshadowed by today's adverse market trend.
Reacting, Panmure Gordon cut its price target on the stock to 45 pence from 57 while keeping 'buy'.
Oilex stayed 5-1/4 pence to 64 pence after an update on the Oman exploration well failed to impress, while 
Sanatana Diamonds shed 5 pence to 67-1/2 pence, as it priced its private placement, announced Jan 14, at 1.35 
cad per unit and 1.55 cad per flow-through share, saying it expects to raise 9-10 mln cad instead of its original 
target of 13 mln.
Safestore Holdings dipped 2-3/4 pence to 150 pence, as the group's positive outlook was overshadowed by wider 
market weakness.
Chief executive Steve Williams said he thinks demand for self storage in the UK and France will continue to grow, 
despite a slowdown in the housing market, as the group posted like-for-like revenues up 14.1 pct to 72.6 mln stg, 
due to increases in occupancy, rates and ancillary revenues.
Reacting, Citigroup kept 'buy', noting that the group makes no reference to the difficult October experienced by rival 
Big Yellow.
Finally, London Scottish Bank dipped 0-1/2 a penny to 27-1/2 pence, as it updated on its impairment charge, saying 
it expects its impairment provision for the year to end-October to be in line with its own expectations.
Reacting, Shore Capital adjusted its 2007 figures while keeping 'hold' on the stock.

Highlight: Ryanair has begun its lawsuit against the Financial Regulator.
Body
Ryanair has begun its lawsuit against the Financial Regulator over alleged insider information on the Aer Lingus 
Shannon-Belfast hub shift.
The airline is challenging what it claims is a decision of the regulator not to investigate why the Government was the 
only party given what it called 'inside information' on the decision to transfer the Aer Lingus Shannon-Heathrow link 
to Belfast.
Ryanair was given leave to seek a judicial review of a decision of the regulator not to carry out an investigation of 
the matter after Aer Lingus chief executive, Dermot Mannion, revealed on radio that the Minister for Transport, Noel 
Dempsey, had been informed of the Heathrow decision before it was publicly announced.
 This amounted to, Ryanair says, the disclosure of inside information to a shareholder which EU regulations 
specifically warn against, and under which the regulator is empowered to investigate. The application for a judicial 
review was made on an ex-parte (one side only) basis by Ryanair. Under the Market Abuse Regulations, firms 
listed on the stock exchange are required to take reasonable care to disclose information in a synchronised way to 
all categories of investors, according to an affidavit from Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary.

Shares on the Dublin market swung back into positive territory after plunging a massive 160 points in the first few 
minutes of trading.
At 10.50am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 74.84 points at 6335.87. 
The ISEQ fell as far as 3pc but managed to creep into positive territory and added 0.83pc to stand at 6,312.83 by 
10.45am.
 Fears about trends in the US economy and the fragility of the global financial system were very much to the 
forefront of investor concerns. In particular, the downgrading of the credit rating of Ambac, the bond insurance 
group, raised concerns of knock-on defaults elsewhere in the system, according to Davy Research. "Concerns 
about the global economic outlook have been around since the start of the year, but yesterday's record falls in 
equity markets globally indicate more than simple concern. Markets believe that the US is already in recession, and 
this threatens the outlook for other regions as well. The UK and Japan, with their own domestic concerns, do look 
vulnerable. "Yesterday, Finance Ministers from Europe sounded the warning bells on their own region too, with the 
Spanish Finance Minister stating that he is worried, and the EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner stating that growth 
forecasts for Europe would need to be revised down," said Dermot O'Leary, analyst at Goodbody Research. Banks 
led the recovery, Bank of Ireland falling 5c to 8.90 and AIB down 15c to 14.00, Anglo Irish Bank slipping 25c to 8.40 
and Irish Life and Permanent up 9c to 10.29. In the construction sector,. McInerney was down 3c at 1.51 and 
Kingspan decreased 30c at 9.55.CRH rose 21c to 23.01 and Grafton climbed 3c to 4.65. Elsewhere, shares at 
bookmaker Paddy Power were down 25c to 18.30 and Irish pharmaceutical company Elan was up 40c to 16.33 
Other notable movers include Ryanair down 3c to 3.61 and DCC up 13c to 16.90.

Irish shares plunged dramatically by more than three per cent today as global stock markets tumbled on fears of a 
US recession. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 272.73 points at 6261.03
Three quarters of the fall took place in the first half-hour of trade as investors fled on the prospects of an impending 
US recession.
 Banks the most likely to feel the effects of market and economic turbulence were the main fallers once again with 
Bank of Ireland falling 29c to 9.03 and AIB down 70c to 14.20, Anglo Irish Bank slipping 42c to 8.74 and Irish Life 
and Permanent plunging 23c to 10.17. Meanwhile, analyst Vikash Patel of global investment group, Bear Stearns, 
has given AIB an 'underperform' rating based on weakness in the Irish bank's assets in the US and Poland. In a 
research note, the analyst mentions that rising impairment and declining loan growth are likely to adversely impact 
the company's growth going forward. Allied Irish Bank's 2008 prospects appear 'lacklustre on account of the 
challenging operating environment in Poland and the US,' the analyst said. The Irish bank has raised its share in 
competitive markets and, hence, its margins are under significant pressure, he added. Construction shares fared 
little better. McInerney was down 4c at 1.53 and Kingspan decreased 34c at 9.96. CRH fell 93c to 22.85 after and 
Grafton slipped 23c to 4.67 after the world's biggest distributor of plumbing and heating products, Wolseley reported 
slower market conditions in the UK and Ireland. The company said its pretax profit for the five-month period to the 
end of December 2007 is likely to have fallen by around a third due to challenging conditions in the US, especially 
in the deteriorating housing market. In a trading statement, it said trading profit for the period would be down by 
around 25pc, with sales just 2pc higher. For the five months to end of December, it reported that sales in its 
UK/Irish businesses were up 3pc, which was down from the 5pc reported for the 3 months to October (Q1). This 
was mostly organic growth, with a positive performance in the UK being offset by tougher market conditions in 
Ireland. Elsewhere, shares at bookmaker Paddy Power were down 90c to 18.65 and Irish pharmaceutical company 
Nearly E3bn wiped off the value of ISEQ
Elan slipped 47c to 16.06. Other notable movers include Ryanair down 14c to 3.66 and DCC down 87c to 17.15. 
Also, shares at drinks group C and C were up 2c to 4.25 despite Magners share of the Great Britain on-trade cider 
market in November falling to 18.1pc year-on-year (yoy) compared to 19.7pc in September 2007 and 27.5pc a year

Shannon opens up to Paris after Aer Lingus endsHeathrow slot
Shannon opens up to Paris after Aer Lingus endsHeathrow slot

Shannon Airport in south-west Ireland is preparing to open a new international connection to Paris in the wake of 
the row over Aer Lingus' decision to end its service to Heathrow, the centrepiece of the airport's operations for close 
on 50 years.
CityJet - owned by Air France - will from February 4 fly to Paris Charles de Gaulle, providing some relief for those 
foreign and local businesses in the Shannon area left marooned when Aer Lingus ended its Heathrow service last 
August, using the valuable landing slots it owns at the UK airport to service a new Northern Ireland route to Belfast.
Last Monday, Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus chief executive, was in Belfast to oversee the first flight out.
However, the day before, Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, was on hand in a local Munster rugby jersey 
at Shannon as the last Aer Lingus flight departed, offering all those flying free tickets to fly to London with his airline.
The rivalry between the two Irish airlines has intensified since Ryanair made an unsuccessful bid for Aer Lingus in 
October 2006, launching a daring dawn raid on the shares shortly after the former state owned carrier was part 
privatised. The government owns 25 per cent, but Ryanair is now the largest single shareholder with just less than 
30 per cent.
Ryanair, rarely a champion of a state-owned airport, was highly critical of Aer Lingus' move to Belfast and tried to 
convene an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to question the strategy. The decision was a particular blow for 
Shannon, which is already set to lose business with the advent of the open skies agreement between the European 
Union and the US, which takes effect from April.
Shannon has been largely developed on the back of a bilateral deal between the US and Ireland, under which 
every other transatlantic flight from the US to Ireland was required to stop there. From November, that has been 
phased out with just one in three flights now landing at Shannon and from April there will be no obligation on US 
flights to do so.
Shannon opens up to Paris after Aer Lingus endsHeathrow slot
Shannon also claims to be the first place to operate duty-free shopping, back in 1947. But that too has been hit by 
the European Commission scrapping duty-free sales within the EU.
In the past few years the airport has enjoyed some revenue relief from the use of Shannon by US army flights 
transiting soldiers and equipment to the Gulf - although, with the Republic of Ireland traditionally a neutral country, 
this is not something the state owned airport has been keen to highlight.

Airline squeeze fear at plane maintenance firm
Airline squeeze fear at plane maintenance firm

The 1,500 staff of SR Technics now face a threat to their jobs as Aer Lingus chief Dermot Mannion cracks down on 
costs at Aer Lingus. David Clerkin and Nicola Cooke report.
In the same week that Shannon Airport woke up to life without an Aer Lingus service to Heathrow, the 1,500 staff at 
SR Technics, the former TEAM AerLingus aircraft maintenance business at Dublin Airport, began to feel the 
unwelcome implications of the former state airline's rebirth as a publicly quoted company.
The clock began ticking at SR Technics when Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion pledged to get tough on 
costs, as the airline geared up for life as a commercial business, free of government interference.
Mannion's pledge took on greater urgency a little over a year ago, when Ryanair's shock takeover attempt left him 
battling to maintain the airline's independence as a standalone company. Among the promises that Mannion made 
to convince investors to back him and keep Aer Lingus out of Ryanair's clutches was a commitment to sweeping 
reforms of the airline's cost base.
Just as Shannon's services to Heathrow needed to be sacrificed because they cost too much and delivered too 
little, SR Technics staff now fear that they too will fall victim to Mannion's determination to spend no more than is 
absolutely necessary.
If Aer Lingus can get its aircraft maintenance cheaper elsewhere - as Ryanair does - the writing may already be on 
the wall for its former subsidiary.
Last week's leaking of an internal SR Technics document looked, to some, like a final throw of the dice on behalf of 
the company and its workers.
If Aer Lingus was about to plump for a cheaper solution to its aircraft maintenance costs, SR Technics' options 
would be limited to either dramatically cutting its prices to win the business, or calling in the government to use its 
25 per cent shareholding in the airline to force Mannion to rethink.
Airline squeeze fear at plane maintenance firm
Cutting prices to win the AerLingus contract would undoubtedly create problems down the line for SR Technics, as 
it would then be forced to reduce its own cost base - presumably by slashing jobs - to remain economically viable.
But, despite a meeting between SR Technics unions and transport minister Noel Dempsey last week, hoping for 
government support appears to be an equally unattractive proposition, based on Dempsey's decision to sit out the 
Shannon row last year.
Dempsey opted to take the flak that came with the Shannon-Heathrow closure, on the basis that the airline was 
now a stand-alone business and needed to operate free from political interference to deliver profits for its 
shareholders.
It is unlikely that a strategy which failed to work at Shannon could succeed in Dublin. Just as Mannion took a hard 
decision in shutting down Shannon-Heathrow because he felt it would be in the best interests of shareholders, he is 
unlikely to award a maintenance contract to SR Technics unless it represents the best commercial deal that he can 
get.
If SR Technics loses the contract, it faces a choice between drumming up replacement business or adapting to life 
without its main customer. It won't be Mannion's problem, or that of his shareholders.
The troubled past of TEAM Aer Lingus never looked like resolving itself into a bright future after being sold on ten 
years ago by the airline to FLS Aerospace, which was later taken over by SR Technics.
There was much resistance to the creation of TEAM as a subsidiary to the then semi-state Aer Lingus in 1990,but 
after major political turmoil and wrangling with unions, a deal was finally done. The sweetener that was required to 
achieve it, however, had unforeseen ramifications.
The then transport minister, Seamus Brennan, ordered that so-called letters of comfort be given to the 1,500 TEAM 
Aer Lingus employees guaranteeing that their jobs were secure. The letters gave six guarantees, including that 
workers would remain Aer Lingus employees, that their pension entitlements and other benefits would be 
preserved, and their seniority and service continue.
When the Zurich-based FLS Aerospace bought TEAM Aer Lingus in 1997, it was forced to pay IR£70 million to buy 
out the letters of comfort. A group of 100 employees that had remained with the airline took the company to court to 
enforce the commitments they had previously been given. In 2002, a High Court judge ruled that the letters were 
''unwarranted and improper'', and that they should only apply for four years.
The employees appealed, and this decision was overturned in the Supreme Court in 2005.The court ruled that the 
letter should be honoured indefinitely.
Now that SR Technics has lost two of the four contracts it has with Aer Lingus - who supply 40 per cent of the 
company's business - the 1,200 full-time and 300 associated jobs there are under serious threat. A decision on 
whether the company has retained the third contract has been delayed, while a decision on the mainline 
maintenance contract is due in about two weeks. Siptu aviation sector organiser Dermot O'Loughlin said the 
decision on the other two contracts presented ''a complex challenge'' for Aer Lingus.
''In the financial context, west European maintenance facilities demand higher labour costs, but SR Technics is the 
premier service in its field,'' O'Loughlin said.
''There is convenience of location, too. A pensions issue regarding former TEAM employees has also not been 
resolved with the company, which could be costly in the future if they are found liable."
TEAM timeline
Mid-1989: Lengthy negotiations to establish TEAM Aer Lingus as a subsidiary of the semi-state company begin with 
unions. These plans involved the transfer of maintenance and engineering staff to TEAM. Despite resistance, they 
are finally accepted.
Airline squeeze fear at plane maintenance firm
April 1990: So-called letters of comfort are issued to more than 1,500 Aer Lingus employees moving to TEAM by 
transport minister Seamus Brennan. The letters give six guarantees, including that workers will remain Aer Lingus 
employees, that their ''pension entitlements and other benefits'' be preserved and that their ''seniority and service'' 
continue.
Late 1998: Aer Lingus sells TEAM to FLS Aerospace. The Zurich-based firm was forced to spend IR£70 million 
buying out the 1,500 employees' comfort letters. A further 100 opted to remain with Aer Lingus but found 
themselves working as general staff at rates of pay below what they earned at the maintenance division.
2002: Sixty-five of those 100 employees take Aer Lingus to court to enforce the commitment. The High Court rules 
the letters were ''unwarranted and improper'' and that they should only apply for a ''reasonable time'', judged to be 
four years.
June 2004: SR Technics acquire FLS Industries operations in Ireland and Britain.
December 2005: The Supreme Court overturns the High Court's decision about the letters of comfort being valid for 
four years and rule they should be honoured indefinitely.
August 2006: The flotation of Aer Lingus is threatened by more than 600 former TEAM Aer Lingus employees 
working at SR Technics who threaten legal action because they are not included in a new supplementary pension 
fund set up as part of the airline's flotation. Aer Lingus says the supplementary fund is entirely discretionary and 
that the main pension fund operates.
January 17, 2007: Up to 1,500 jobs are at risk at SR Technics as two of its four contracts with Aer Lingus - which 
make up 40 per cent of their business - are lost. If the mainline maintenance contract is lost by the end of January, 
SR Technics will close.

The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said it has cleared easyJet PLC's acquisition of GB Airways Ltd.
EasyJet agreed in October to acquire GB Airways and 28 London Gatwick slot pairs from Bland Group for 103.5 
mln stg in cash to expand its presence at Gatwick. The OFT said it has decided the merger raises no competition 
concerns in any market.
EasyJet and GB Airways overlap in the supply of scheduled passenger
flights on certain routes from London Gatwick airport to destinations popular with leisure travellers, such as the 
Balearic Islands and Innsbruck. GB Airways has operated these routes in accordance with a franchise agreement 
with British Airways PLC.
The OFT said this fact was significant in ruling out concerns based on the loss of potential competition on totally 
new routes in the future, because under the franchise agreement BA has a veto over GB Airways' new routes.
The OFT said it had initial concerns on overlap routes because the combined market shares were over 40 pct in 
every case. It added that there was some evidence to suggest that entry onto a route was difficult because it is hard 
to obtain additional capacity at London airports, or to move existing capacity from one route to another.
'This is a prime example of how actual entry on all overlap routes can clearly resolve initial concerns. These 
examples demonstrate that when it comes to these routes, easyJet and its rivals - such as BA, Ryanair and 
Monarch - have been able to overcome any barriers to entry at various London airports,' said Chloe MacEwen, the 
OFT's deputy director of mergers.

Air France-KLM ADRs fall after company says it plans to delist US shares;

American shares of Air France-KLM fell Friday after the Franco-Dutch airline said it has asked that its stock be 
removed from the New York Stock Exchange.
Air France-KLM said in a press release that it will apply for voluntary delisting, which it expects to take effect on 
Feb. 7. Air France-KLM is the parent of both Air France and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
The company said that more than 95 percent of trades involving its shares take place on Euronext Paris, and as a 
result, the expense of listing on the NYSE in the U.S. is not justified.
American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, of Air France-KLM slipped 90 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $27.69 in afternoon 
trading. Earlier in the session, they reached an annual low of $27.50.
ADRs are securities that allow U.S. investors to trade shares of companies based overseas. Air France-KLM ADRs 
began trading on May 5, 2004, and the delisting will leave Irish rival Irish rival Ryanair Holdings PLC as the only 
European carrier traded on a U.S. exchange.
Over the last 100 days, investors have traded an average of about 83,600 ADRs of Air France-KLM per day, 
although Friday's trading was three times heavier. In the same period, Ryanair traded more than 750,000 shares 
each day.
Major investors also seemed more fond of Ryanair stock. The largest U.S. holder of Air France-KLM ADRs is 
Donald Smith & Co., which owns about 5.2 million shares. There are six firms that own more than 10 million shares 
of Ryanair, topped by Capital Research & Management Co., with 33.1 million.
Air France-KLM has 300.2 million shares outstanding, while Ryanair has 298.2 million.
Ryanair stock gained 18 cents to $32.96 in afternoon trading.

The Bank of New York Europe ADR index, which tracks the movement of more than 100 ADRs, declined 1.20 
points to 171.24. The Dow Jones industrial average, the Nasdaq composite index and Standard and Poor's 500 
were also down.

Body
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said it has cleared easyJet's acquisition of GB Airways.
EasyJet agreed in October to acquire GB Airways and 28 London Gatwick slot pairs from Bland Group for £103.5 
million in cash to expand its presence at Gatwick.
 The OFT said it has decided the merger raises no competition concerns in any market.
 EasyJet and GB Airways overlap in the supply of scheduled passenger flights on certain routes from London 
Gatwick airport to destinations popular with leisure travellers, such as the Balearic Islands and Innsbruck. GB 
Airways has operated these routes in accordance with a franchise agreement with British Airways. The OFT said 
this fact was significant in ruling out concerns based on the loss of potential competition on totally new routes in the 
future, because under the franchise agreement BA has a veto over GB Airways' new routes. The OFT said it had 
initial concerns on overlap routes because the combined market shares were over 40 pct in every case. It added 
that there was some evidence to suggest that entry onto a route was difficult because it is hard to obtain additional 
capacity at London airports, or to move existing capacity from one route to another. 'This is a prime example of how 
actual entry on all overlap routes can clearly resolve initial concerns. These examples demonstrate that when it 
comes to these routes, easyJet and its rivals - such as BA, Ryanair and Monarch - have been able to overcome any 
barriers to entry at various London airports,' said Chloe MacEwen, the OFT's deputy director of mergers Copyright:

Highlight: A better performance by the banking sector helped push the Dublin market
Body
A better performance by the banking sector helped push the Dublin market higher today.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 19.00 points at 6487.53
However, Irish banks are trading 43pc off their highs of last year, making this the second-worst bear market in the 
past 30 years, according to Davy Research. The worst was in 1999/2000, which lasted 13 months and saw a 
decline of 46pc, it said. Banking shares were mixed. Bank of Ireland remained flat at 9.43 and AIB climbed 28c to 
14.97. Anglo Irish Bank was down 5c to 9.10 and Irish Life and Permanent rose 30c to 10.20. In the construction 
sector, Grafton was up 1c to 4.80, McInerney was up 2c at 1.50 and Kingspan rose 4c to 10.06 CRH climbed 66c to 
23.50 after the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) reported that confidence among US homebuilders 
remained close to its lowest-ever reading in January. 
The NAHB index rose to 19, up marginally on December's revised reading of 18 and in line with the street's 
expectations. Levels lower than 50 mean respondents view conditions as poor. The measure of prospective buyer 
traffic rose from its lowest-ever reading of 13 in December to 14 in January. Encouragingly, the index gauging 
builders' sales expectations for the next six months rose 2 points to 28. This is the second month in succession that 
this index has risen and reflects builders' hopes that the second half of 2008 may see a recovery in US building 
activity. "With c.7.5pc of group revenue derived from new residential construction in the US, an upswing in 
homebuilding activity would be a positive for CRH," according to Robert Gardiner, analyst at Davy Research. 
Elsewhere, shares at bookmaker Paddy Power were up 62c to 19.70 and Irish pharmaceutical company Elan 
dropped 13c to 16.72. Other notable movers include ICG up 45c to 18.45 and Kerry Group up 19c to 19.39 Shares 
at no-frills airline Ryanair climbed 7c to 3.82 and Aer Lingus rose 5c to 2.20 as the price of oil remained around the 
USD91 a barrel mark. "The spot price of jet kerosene has fallen substantially over the past week from over USD900 
a tonne to USD843.5 at close yesterday. While this is an obvious positive for the airline sector, it is worth noting that 
the forward curve is no longer in backwardation as it had been since early September," Brian Carr, analyst at Davy 
Banks help push the Dublin market higher
Research said. Meanwhile, shares at Glanbia were unchanged at 4.70 after it has confirmed that it has entered into 
negotiations, which may lead to a MBO of Glanbia Meats. "This development comes as no surprise as the meat 
division is of limited strategic importance for the company at this stage, since its focus is now on the ingredients 
division, specifically nutritional ingredients, cheese and consumer foods. We expect that, should this divestment of 
the meat division occur, the impact to EPS would be minimal," according to Goodbody Stockbrokers. Also, shares 
at DCC fell 31c to 18.72 despite HMV saying that it expects its full-year pre-tax profit to be towards the upper end of 
the current market expectations of £43-£53 million. The company said its UK and Ireland total sales increased 
16.1pc, including like-for-like growth of 14.1pc, in the five-week period. "Following on from Game's trading update 
earlier in the week, this statement can again be broadly taken as a positive for Sercom, DCC's IT business. Eighty 
percent of Sercom's business comprises sales of hardware- and software-related products, with the growth in 
business being driven by sales of games and ancillary-related products," according David Jennings, analyst at Davy 
Research.

Banks led the Dublin market lower at midday along with a share plunge by drinks group C and C.
At 11.45am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 86.48 points at 6392.34
Drinks group, C and C, this morning warned that revenue and operating profits for its full year will fall with earnings 
coming in lower than expected.
 The group said it expects its overall revenues for the year to the end of February 2008 to fall by about 10E 
compared to the previous fiscal year. Bank of Ireland slipped 8c to 9.35 and AIB fell 8c to 14.39. Anglo Irish Bank 
was down 29c to 9.16 and Irish Life and Permanent dropped 19c to 9.71. "The results announcements from 
Citigroup and Hypo Real Estate yesterday (January 15th) and the resulting share price reactions served as a stark 
reminder of the current vulnerability of financial stocks. Indeed, it may be a long and difficult reporting season," 
according to Niamh Hore, analyst at Davy Research. Construction shares fared little better. CRH slipped 29c to 
22.35 and Grafton fell 11c to 4.69. McInerney was unchanged at 1.48 and Kingspan was down 9c to 9.81. 
Elsewhere, shares at bookmaker Paddy Power fell 29c to 18.31 while Irish pharmaceutical company Elan climbed 
20c to 16.72. Other notable movers include, Greencore down 10c to 3.90 and Tullow down 30c to 7.34. Shares at 
Ryanair were up 6c to 3.74 after it announced its 25th base at Birmingham. Ryanair continues to attract airport 
business, which in previous times would perhaps not even have talked to the company, according to Stephen 
Furlong, analyst at Davy Research. "The selection of Birmingham is illustrative of the airports, which want Ryanair's 
business and the growth potential still available in the UK regions," he said.

If BAA is the tall man crammed into economy, Ruth Kelly is the passenger in front who, without warning, ratchets 
her seat back on to his knees.
The airports owner and Ferrovial, its owner, are already squeezed by regulatory conditions tighter than the Spanish 
infrastructure group expected when it led BAA's leveraged buy-out in 2006. They had hoped the transport secretary 
would agree with the Civil Aviation Authority that there was no longer a need to cap prices at Stansted, the smallest 
of BAA's three London airports. Instead, she disagreed.
BAA made the best of Ms Kelly's unexpected decision. At least, it said, she reiterated the government's 
commitment to more runways at Stansted and at Heathrow. But with credit markets as clogged as a departure 
lounge on a foggy Christmas Eve, that is cold comfort for the airports group and its owner. The Spanish group still 
wants to securitise some Pounds 10bn of new and assumed debt that was the legacy of the acquisition. It has 
delayed the refinancing while it waits for a pricing regime for Heathrow and Gatwick to be finalised.
Airlines - particularly the low-fare, short-haul specialists such as Ryanair and EasyJet - were, unsurprisingly, cock-
a-hoop. They should be. The regulator had based its recommendation, in part, on the observation that if BAA could 
not set prices at the highest level possible under a regulated system, the free market must be working. As if to rub 
in its victory, Ryanair yesterday opened a new base at Birmingham airport - which is close enough to draw custom 
away from Stansted, according to the CAA analysis rejected by the government. The regulator now has the tough 
task of coming up with a price cap for Stansted that is flexible enough to make it worthwhile for BAA to add extra 
capacity.
It is hard to shed tears for Ferrovial, an infrastructure expert that went into the BAA deal with its eyes open. Its UK 
airports remain plagued by delays and congestion. But the sort of uncertainty sown by yesterday's decision will only 
make it harder to alleviate BAA's debt burden.

The European Parliament on Tuesday voted to set clearer rules for calculating airport taxes paid by passengers to 
try and prevent airports increasing the charges at will.
Airports charge airlines for using their facilities, and the cost is transferred to passengers, sometimes making up a 
substantial part of the ticket price.
Under the new rules, which affect Europe's 67 biggest airports and still need approval from the EU's 27 nations, 
airports will now have to consult airlines on the way charges are structured. If airlines deem the taxes excessive, 
they will be able to appeal to a national regulatory body, which will help solve disagreements.
The new guidelines set the level of service quality to be provided by an airport's managing body in return for the 
charges. The rules allow airports to pay for upgrades by increasing charges before they carry out any work, but only 
if passengers are informed of what they are paying for and of the duration of the tax increase.
Europe's largest budget carrier, Ryanair Holdings PLC, has been in a disagreement with London's Stansted and 
Dublin airports over increased charges to pay for new terminals. Stansted doubled charges in April and will increase 
fees again this year as it builds a 4 billion pound ($7US.9 billion; €5.3 billion) second terminal.
The parliament wants to rules to apply to all EU airports handling more than 5 million passengers a year.

Shares on the Dublin market were lower at midday ahead of the most important US report of the week, which is out 
today.
At 12.00pm, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 29.54 points at 6698.87
Stock and credit markets fear that not only will the US enter recession but that it may be consumer-led, according to 
Rossa White, analyst at Davy Research.
 "That may lead to a sharper downturn, more like 1990/1991 than 2001. Today's December retail sales are another 
important milestone. Sales spiked in November, leading to a high base, so there must be a significant risk of 
disappointment after Friday's weak reports from consumer-related stocks. "At the moment, stock market investors 
are giving precedence to recession-risk over Fed rate cuts and the massive bond market rally. Cyclicals have joined 
financials lower, while defensives like pharma and utilities have outperformed. So equities are set for a tough time 
until the recession debate is resolved further, which will be a few months away. We still think that the US will 
muddle through and avoid recession and that the Fed's actions (and possible fiscal stimulus) will spark a rebound 
later in the year," he said. Bank of Ireland fell 17c to 9.79 and AIB slipped 11c to 15.04. Anglo Irish Bank was down 
23c to 9.65 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 27c to 10.15. In the construction sector, CRH slipped 41c to

Close to E3 billion was wiped off the value of Irish shares today as a double blow in the US sent shares tumbling. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 252.95 points at 6475.51
US government figures showed that retail sales fell 0.4pc in December, the worst performance in six months, while 
the Citigroup bank reported its first quarterly loss since its creation in 1998. 
 Citigroup reported a fourth-quarter loss of USD9.83 billion. The results include USD18.1 billion in subprime-related 
writedowns and credit costs, and a USD4.1 billion increase in consumer-related credit costs. Revenue fell to 
USD7.22 billion from USD23.83 billion in the same period a year ago, compared with analyst forecasts of 
USD10.64 billion, as increases in global consumer and global wealth management offset declines in markets and 
banking and alternative investments. Stock and credit markets fear that not only will the US enter recession but that

Body
The European Commission says it has opened an investigation into potential state aid granted to Ryanair and a 
number of other airlines by Aarhus airport operator Aarhus Lufthavn A/S.
The investigation follows a complaint that the Danish airport operator granted state aid to various air carriers 
operating at Aarhus airport through discriminatory rebates on airport charges.
On the basis of the investigation, the commission will determine whether Aarhus Lufthavn A/S sets its airport 
charges independently from the public authorities, or whether the arrangements it has concluded with various 
airlines are in line with the market economy investor principle.
If either of these questions is answered positively, the airport charges at stake do not involve state aid, the 
commission says.
However, if the investigation finds aid was granted to airlines, the commission would need to determine whether it is 
compatible with the common market.

The airline will deliver 20 new routes from Birmingham to Denmark, France, Italy and Spain among other routes 
with an initial two Boeing 737-800 aircraft costing USD140m.
A further eight aircraft at an investment cost of USD560m will follow.
 This will deliver five million passengers annually, a visitor spend of £400m a year and sustain 5,000 jobs in the 
region. "The people of Birmingham have been woefully underserved and overcharged by British Airways and 
Flybe's high fares for years. Ryanair's new base will smash this high fare stranglehold by delivering savings of 
£130m next year for Birmingham's passengers / visitors," Ryanair chief, Michael O'Leary said.

smaller airlines wanting to bring more flight training in-house, which in the past has meant buying more expensive 
Level D devices. CAE's Level D simulator, the Series 7000, starts at $11C million.
Pilots can use Level B simulators for 80% of their initial training and 100% of their recurrent training every six 
months. Previously, cost-benefit analyses did not favour buying the devices because fidelity paled when compared 
with more sophisticated Level D simulators from main rivals CAE and Thales.
Developed through an research and development programme funded by CAE and the Canadian government, the 
Series 5000 will, says CAE, offer a 25% reduction in lifecycle costs, which tend to be two to three times the original 
cost of the simulator during a 20-year lifetime. It also has 50% fewer parts, easing maintenance, and its order-to-
operational delivery time has been reduced from more than a year for the Series 7000 to eight months or less for 
the Series 5000.
Other deliveries this year include a Level D Series 5000 Boeing 737NG simulator for CAE's training centre in 
Amsterdam, a Level B A320 FFS for Lufthansa Flight Training, the first of five 737NG simulators for Ryanair and an 
FFS of the Embraer Phenom 100 very light jet.

Ireland West Airport Knock is predicting a record 2008 in passenger numbers after a strong Christmas period.
December and the Christmas season was the busiest ever at Ireland West Airport Knock, with 38,000 passengers 
passing through.
Although overall traveller numbers fell last year, airport chiefs have set an ambitious target to have annual growth 
up to almost 700,000.
 "Following five consecutive years of double digit growth, our overall passenger numbers for 2007 were 567,000, a 
decline of 9 per cent on the previous year," said Robert Grealis, CEO, Ireland West Airport Knock. "However, our 
new routes together with the good news that air carrier bmibaby will start a new scheduled route to Glasgow 
International Airport in February, we are projecting that passenger volumes in 2008 will increase by a quarter to 
almost 700,000, which will be the busiest year ever in the history of the Airport." Mr Grealis said the airport faced 
significant challenges at the outset of 2007, having lost almost a quarter of its annual passengers due to the 
withdrawal of a twice daily services to London Gatwick by easyJet and Ryanair in late 2006. "The loss of these 
routes has had a significant impact in 2007 but was minimised and offset with the development of scheduled 
services to East Midlands and Bristol with Ryanair and the welcome re-introduction of a six-times-a-week service to 
London Gatwick with XL.com in December," he added.

A more energised performance by the banks and a share surge by Aer Lingus drove the Dublin market higher 
today. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 67.62 points at 6728.46
Aer Lingus saw its share price soar by 5c to 2.15 after it begun services from Belfast to Heathrow and 
controversially closed its Shannon hub.
 The airline started a new route to London this morning from Belfast International airport and is expecting tough 
competition on flights to the UK capital. "This is an important test of Aer Lingus' ability to migrate its business model 
outside the Republic. Success will encourage it to pursue other bases in the UK. Failure would close off a growth 
path for short-haul. As with all UK/Irish airlines at present, Aer Lingus must overcome stiff headwinds in 2008; 
weakening consumer demand, soft Sterling, high oil prices and US economic difficulties," according to Joe Gill, 
analyst at Goodbosy Research. Bank of Ireland rose 36c to 9.98 and AIB was up 24c to 15.21. Anglo Irish Bank 
climbed 23c to 9.97 and Irish Life and Permanent was up 8c to 10.58. In the construction sector, CRH was up 47c 
to 23.42 and Grafton remained flat at 5.00. McInerney was up 1c to 1.54 and Kingspan rose 25c to 10.30. The 
latest Irish purchasing managers' index for December 2007 shows that confidence within the construction sector 
continued to decline. The overall reading of 35.7 (any reading below 50 indicates the sector is declining) is the 
lowest outturn since the series began in June 2000 and compares to 42 in November. Unsurprisingly the residential 
component remained the weakest sector, down to 23.5 from 24.0 in November and the thirteenth successive 
negative reading. More concerning, both the non-residential (45.6) and civil engineering (45.4) components were 
also negative in December, down from 49.2 and 53.5 in November. We will wait to see if these data are just a blip, 
or the beginning of negative growth throughout the construction sector, Robert Eason, analyst at Goodbody 
Research said. "We are forecasting housing completions to fall to 50,000 this year, a 33pc fall on the estimated 
75,000 units in 2007, while we believe non-residential construction will continue to remain buoyant through 2008, 
ISEQ closes higher on banks, Aer Lingus
especially infrastructure which is underpinned by the National Development Programme." Elsewhere, shares at no-
frills airline Ryanair dropped to 10c to 3.78 while Irish pharmaceutical company Elan climbed 17c to 16.85. Other 
notable movers include DCC down 24c to 19.87, ICG up 10c to 18.00 and Icon up E1.30 to 46.30. Shares at 
Independent News and Media were up 2c to 2.39 despite the latest ABC figures highlighting a continuing circulation 
decline for the group. The figures, for the six months July to December 2007, show that The Independent in the UK 
had an average daily circulation of 239,244, a 5.71pc reduction over the same period last year. Circulation of other 
national morning quality newspapers fell by an average of 2.49pc over the same period. The Independent on 
Sunday recorded a 4.69pc decline over the same period, with the average circulation of other national Sunday 
quality newspapers falling 4.77pc. During the same period, The Irish Daily Mail registered a 2.2pc decline in daily 
circulation to 58,861. Figures for the Irish free sheets for the same period showed that INM's Herald AM performed 
well, registering a 22.72pc year-on-year increase. Its competitor, Metro, recorded a 30.66pc rise against a weaker 
comparison period. Consequently, in absolute numbers, the Herald maintained its lead with an average daily 
circulation of 76,364 while Metro had an average of 75,449 daily copies.

Aer Lingus Group's pilots union has been forced to withdraw its labour claims against Ryanair Holdings PLC after 
the IALPA/IMPACT unions failed to attend a scheduled hearing at the labour court today.
IALPA/IMPACT hoped to use the Industrial Relations Acts of 2001 and 2004 to show Ryanair was underpaying its 
Dublin pilots. Ryanair, however, always maintained that the legislation did not apply to high pay multi-national 
companies such as itself. Ryanair won a Supreme Court case against IALPA/IMPACT last February.
'It is time that the trade unions in Ireland recognised that they have no role to play in high pay multi-national 
companies like Ryanair,' Ryanair's Eddie Wilson said in a statement.
IMPACT's Michael Landers said the union saw the ruling 'as no more than a temporary set back'.

Ryanair has announced a new route from Shannon to Palma Mallorca on the day that Aer Lingus closed its 
Shannon to Heathrow service.
Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary, flew in to Shannon to launch the service and took the opportunity to seek 
to embarrass his largest Irish rival following the controversial Aer Lingus decision to re-locate its hub to Belfast.
'As the people of Shannon say "Good riddance" to Aer Lingus' high fares, we are giving free flights to Shannon to 
all of the passengers departing on Aer Lingus' last flight. We are also announcing another new route from Shannon 
to Palma Mallorca, opening March,' Mr O'Leary said.
 Ryanair now operates 31 routes from the airport and said it is looking at the possibility of expanding the service 
further this year.

Aer Lingus has sold an average of just one third of its seats on the controversial new Belfast to London Heathrow 
route for the first month of its operation. The service begins tomorrow, as the Shannon-Heathrow route ends.
A total of 32,364 seats are available on the return route for the first month, with three 174-seat aircraft flying three 
return trips daily. With an average load factor of just 35 per cent, it means only 11,327 of these flights have been 
sold to date - despite being available online since early August last.
Many Aer Lingus return flights from Heathrow to Belfast Aldergrove for the first month of service cost stg£1, and £1 
fares can also be secured from Belfast to Heathrow for this period. These fares and a 35 per cent load factor 
compare with an average load factor of almost 80 per cent - and  80 one-way flights - on the axed Shannon-
Heathrow route.
The Belfast Aldergrove to Heathrow route is competing with a Ryanair Belfast city airport to Stansted service, a 
Cityjet Belfast city to London city airport route and a BMI Belfast city to London Heathrow service.
Passenger figures on Aer Lingus flights from Belfast to Amsterdam - which started on December 10 - are also 
reported to be poor. The majority of return flights from Amsterdam currently cost just £2.
Aer Lingus's corporate affairs director, Enda Corneille, said the company was ''delighted'' with bookings on the 
Belfast-Heathrow route, and that people booked ''very late'' on this route and the Amsterdam route.
An Aer Lingus spokesman previously told The Sunday Business Post that passengers travelling to Heathrow 
usually booked ''two to three weeks in advance''.
''All these flights do not cost £1 or £2 - as they are booked, they increase in price - but we are a low fares airline and 
offer low prices on almost every flight in the system," Corneille said.
Aer Lingus sells just one third of Belfast seats
''We don't comment on load factors for individual routes. Flights [from Belfast] after Easter to Faro, Malaga, 
Barcelona and Budapest are booking very well, and in most cases, quicker than from our bases in the Republic.
''We plan to sell half a million seats in our first full year of operation from Belfast, from the 700,000 available," he 
said.
An industry source said an average load factor of 35 per cent would have to double for the Heathrow service to be 
commercially viable.

'Robopaddy' has suddenly realised that buying property abroad doesn't spread the risk.
Back in 2005 a strange creature emerged out of the Irish property boom. He could be seen at regional airports all 
around Europe, but particularly in Britain.
You might have seen him, sweating, laden down with paperwork, Celtic away strip with unsightly wet patches under 
the arm, squinting up at the monitor to see just how long the Ryanair flight from Teesside is delayed.
What does he care: he has just picked up half a dozen council houses in South Shields, just outside Newcastle, for 
half nothing. Do you remember the movie Robocop? Robocop went around the world trying to save the place, 
whereas our new character - Robopaddy - flies around the world trying to buy the place.
Like Robocop, he is an invincible good guy - an indestructible force - driven by his own mission, which is to buy as 
much foreign property as humanly possible. Robopaddy lives on his wits, by the seat of his pants. He is curious, 
adventurous and loves life.
He has never been to Newcastle until this one afternoon driving around in the company of a matey Geordie 
salesman. It's not too bad really. The conversation revolves around Newcastle United, Shay Given and Gazza. The 
city is in the middle of its own buy-to-let boom. Rick the salesman sells about 40 per cent of his stock to Irish 
investors. They deal quicker and in bigger amounts than the equivalent English buyer, ask fewer questions and 
cough up deposits on the spot.
Rick purposefully drives him though the better areas, the leafy redbrick suburbs with clean Waitrose shopping 
centres, red pillar boxes and alarmingly precise road signs - all staples of upright, balanced, suburban England. The 
place is a shrine to red Vauxhall Astras, Courage pubs, dyed blond hair, sports and leisure wear and ill-advised 
Argos male jewellery endorsed by a premier league footballer.
British property market is no longer quite as safe as houses
This is Ant and Dec land - the interface of middle England and underbelly England which the Labour government is 
intent on privatising - and Robopaddy is a beneficiary, or at least he hopes he is. He checks out the show house, 
which has been vacated and tarted up for him. Neighbours peer over walls and from the white van parked in the 
driveway.
He's seen enough, shakes on the deal, and by the time he is sitting down to his pale ale at the Formica tables in 
Teesside Airport, fruit machine flashing away as another work-shy feral Darren or Lee gambles away his giro, 
Robopaddy has added to his portfolio: ''11 per cent yield - where would you better it?"
Today, in early 2008, Robopaddy is worried. His overall portfolio is looking shaky. He tried to offload the Geordie 
council houses and got nowhere. More to the point, he is now realising that his entire portfolio is interlinked.
It is slowly dawning on Robopaddy that the global property market, which he had argued was diversified, is in fact 
one large bet on a single asset class. Most crucially, this bet is subject to contagion.
When one market suffers, others do too. This idea of intertwining bets and contagion was reinforced for me years 
ago when I met an investor on a business trip to Hong Kong in 1997.A savvy investor, facing losses in Asia, he 
started asking questions about Ukraine where he had exposure. He flogged his Ukrainian assets to cover his Asian 
losses, despite the fact that there was nothing intrinsically wrong with the Ukrainian economy. The same is 
happening now in the global property market.
The Irish, who have been the biggest foreign investors in Britain, are now trying to flog their British assets to cover 
losses in Ireland. The only problem now for Robopaddy is that the British market is weakening quickly.
It is becoming apparent that the credit crunch in Britain is leading to the following dilemma: British banks are 
demanding more credit to restructure their balance sheets but other British banks are lending less because they are 
trying to do exactly the same. So the home builders caught in the middle with huge leverage are getting hammered. 
This is the macroeconomic backdrop which explains Robopaddy's anxiety.
Because housing markets move slowly and underlying problems take months and years to play out, the best way to 
get a snapshot of the fundamental state of the British property market is to examine listed property shares. The 
picture is not pretty. For example, British Land's share price has fallen by 45 per cent in the past year, wiping out all 
the gains it made in the past four years.
Last week, Britain's second largest home builder announced that house sales had fallen by 14 per cent in the last 
quarter of 2007.TaylorWimpey, Britain's largest home builder has seen its share price fall by almost 60 per cent, 
while Barratt Development has lost more than 70 per cent. Meanwhile, weakness from the housing market has 
seeped into industry with the Confederation of British Industry revealing this week that 44 per cent of its survey 
respondents confirmed declining order growth and 70 per cent believed the credit crunch would last longer than six 
months.
All this should be prompting the Bank of England to cut interest rates but it is in a catch-22 situation because 
underlying inflation in Britain is on the rise, particularly with food prices, which have risen by 5.3 per cent, and petrol 
prices, which are up 16.5 per cent. Even if the Bank of England wanted to cut interest rates to save the housing 
market, higher inflation prevents it.
This policy confusion is weighing very heavily on sterling which is below its all time low against the euro and still 
falling. Interestingly, the last time sterling was so weak, Ireland had a currency crisis prompting a major devaluation 
in 1993. This time we can't devalue, so all the pain of the adjustment will be felt in the real economy, mainly through 
ever weaker house prices.
For Robopaddy - the swashbuckling property prince of a few years back - it's becoming clear that all markets are 
related. The English market, which many Irish investors deemed to be stronger than our own, has proved over the 
past few months to be just as vulnerable. It is now not easy to sell in one housing market to offset losses in another. 
What goes up together, goes down in unison.

EasyJet stays calm amid airlines retreat

The stock market is in febrile mood. The oil price has never been higher, worries abound about the state of 
consumer spending and airline share prices are in sharp retreat, led this week by EasyJet with a fall of 20 per cent 
over two days.
Andy Harrison, EasyJet chief executive, decided on Wednesday it was time to buy and spent Pounds 248,000 on 
his airline's shares, which are down 42 per cent over the past nine months.
He is yet to share stock market disquiet about the outlook for low-cost carriers, in spite of issuing somewhat weak 
traffic figures on Tuesday, triggering the sharp price fall.
"EasyJet will win through in the tougher economic environment," Mr Harrison told the Financial Times. It will be 
helped, he says, by the low average age of its fleet and the fuel efficiency of its new Airbus aircraft.
All carriers will seek to pass on higher fuel costs to passengers, he says, supporting fare levels. Many rival low-cost 
and charter airlines will probably be cautious in adding capacity, he adds, assisting the growth of EasyJet and 
Ryanair, its big competitor.
Many investors appear to have interpreted EasyJet's weaker December traffic figures as a veiled profit warning, but 
Mr Harrison says stock market rules would enforce disclosure if he knew anything untoward about the outlook. He 
has made no such disclosure, he says, and is sticking to previous guidance for a rise in pre-tax pro-fits of about 20 
per cent in the year to the end-September.
"It is clearly a more difficult time, we must pass on fuel costs and the consumer environment is tougher, but EasyJet 
will do relatively well going through this environment. Our revenues are on track. We are getting the revenues we 
need."
Most important, revenues are being boosted by the introduction last October of its first charges for checked- in 
bags. The charge was raised to Pounds 3.99 a bag in November and with about three-quarters of an ex-pected 
42m passengers this year checking in bags, the airline has already created a useful revenue cushion.
EasyJet stays calm amid airlines retreat
Increasingly, EasyJet is also becoming less dependent on the UK, as it rolls out a pan-European strategy by 
opening a series of bases around continental Europe with the main emphasis in France, Italy and Spain. About a 
third of its network capacity is now deployed at mainland European bases, up from 23 per cent in 2006.
Two years ago it opened a base at Milan's Malpensa airport, where it is taking full advantage of the woes suffered 
by Alitalia, the struggling Italian flag carrier. It will have 15 aircraft based in Milan by the end of the year, making it 
the group's third- largest base after London Gatwick and London Luton airports and ahead of London Stansted.
Last year it opened Madrid as a base and this spring two new bases are being added in France at Paris Charles de 
Gaulle and Lyon airports.
Easyjet is also establishing a new domestic stronghold at Gatwick, supported by the takeover of GB Airways, the 
British Airways franchise carrier.
Including the acquisition, it will have 35 aircraft at Gatwick - a presence to rival the retrenching BA.

Body
Another broker has lowered its financial forecasts for no-frills airline Ryanair next year.
Joe Gill, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers cited oil highs, the deterioration of UK retail news flow and the 
weakened pound as the reasons for the cut.
Mr. Gill now sees a 2pc drop in operating profits in the year to March 2009, compared with a previous forecast for a 
10pc rise. 
 "Accordingly, we are cutting our FY09 Earnings Per Share by 10pc to 31.6c (while leaving FY March 08 
unchanged). Ryanair will respond to these conditions in a predictable way - ruthlessly. Intense fare competition will 
be used to sustain load factors as it continues to raise annual capacity by up to 20pc," the broker said in a note this 
morning. Earlier this week, Citigroup lowered its earnings per share forecast for the airline for both 2009 and 2010 
due to higher fuel prices and a weaker pound against the euro.

Mr Justice Frank Clarke ruled in favour of the DAA today and said the airline was bound by the previous agreement.
 The DAA claims Ryanair's legal challenge to the permission cannot be permitted because of a settlement reached 
between the budget airline and the Government in March 2006. Planning permission was granted by An Bord 
Pleanala for the second terminal, T2, last August, and Ryanair launched a High Court challenge to the validity of 
that decision in September. The DAA said the ruling removed the threat of any further delay to the new terminal.

Highlight: Shares on the Dublin market ended lower today
Body
Shares on the Dublin market ended lower today after companies that are exposed to sterling fell following the 
decision by the Bank of England to keep key rates on hold at 5.5pc.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 65.28 points at 6618.25
Irish shares were affected after sterling recovered some lost ground against the euro today before the verdict.
 The euro had slipped to £0.7472, from £0.7486 before the BoE's announcement. Against the dollar, the pound had 
risen to USD1.9621 from USD1.9602 before the decision The no change verdict comes despite mounting evidence 
of a weakening economy - especially in the housing and retail sectors - highlighted by a dismal trading statement 
from Marks and Spencer yesterday. The vote on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is likely to 
have been close. Markets were pricing in a strong chance of a rate cut today, although the consensus had been for 
no change. Banks also dragged the index lower, Bank of Ireland fell 37c to 9.75 and AIB slipped 2c to 14.76. Anglo 
Irish Bank dropped 16c to 9.66 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 28c to 10.92. Construction shares fared 
little better. CRH was down 50c to 22.35 and Grafton slipped 12c to 5.05. McInerney was up 6c to 1.52 and 
Kingspan fell 15c to 10.25 Elsewhere, shares at no-frills airline Ryanair rose 25c to 3.85 after Davy Research said it 
believes the airline 'still has a fighting chance' of delivering earnings growth this year. "The market remains 
extremely nervous about consumers stocks and coupled with very high oil prices, this has seen Ryanair and 
easyJet decline 23pc and 31pc respectively since the start of the year," Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy Research 
said. "Ryanair is currently booking ahead of this time last year and traffic numbers are running ahead: year-to-date 
traffic growth is 20.1pc, leaving only 15.5pc growth to achieve its 50.5m target for the March 2008 financial year. 
"While clearly there is some uncertainty for 2008 given the sky-high oil price, weakening sterling and UK economic 
data, we believe that Ryanair still has a fighting chance of delivering earnings growth this year. "Offsetting factors to 
cover a potential 5 per passenger fuel hit include cost savings, ancillary revenues (the new reservation system with 
dynamic packaging will help) and unit revenues elsewhere (bag charges, priority boarding, desk check-in and 
ISEQ closes lower on sterling factor
excess baggage). Of course, there is also the possibility that slowing world GDP growth will finally drive down the 
oil price." Other notable movers include Smurfit Kappa down 72c to 9.88, Irish Continental Group down E1.10 to 
18.20 and Icon up E2.08 to 45.48 Shares at Greencore slipped 3c to 4.35 despite a positive trading update from 
Sainsbury, which it supplies products to. Sainsbury said it recorded like-for-like sales growth of 3.7pc in the third 
quarter (total growth 5.9pc) to December 29th and reached its goal of an additional £2.5 billion in sales, since 
March 2005. The strongest growth was recorded in its premium own-label segment "taste the difference", but it also 
had a good performance in its basic value range. While noting that consumer budgets are stretched and that the 
market will stay competitive, Sainsbury remains confident about delivering on its growth plans. Greencore supplies 
sandwiches and sauces into Sainsbury and the statement reinforces Goodbody's view that FY08 will see 
Greencore delivering further organic growth.

Shares of Europe-based airlines trading on U.S. exchanges rose Thursday, with Ryanair Holdings PLC climbing 
after a Citi Investment Research analyst said the company is poised to beat out its competitors in a recession.
Andrew Light said Ryanair would come out of a recession stronger than its rivals because passengers will "trade 
down" to Ryanair's less expensive flights. Charter airlines, national airlines and low-cost carriers would probably 
reduce their number of flights, he added.
"Ryanair is still a winner in recession," Light said. He lowered his price target to $40 per share from $51, but said 
lower fuel prices, cutbacks or financial problems for a rival or an increase in Ryanair's profit forecast.
American Depositary Receipts of Ryanair, which is based in Ireland, gained $2.14, or 6.7 percent, to $34.14. ADRs 
are securities that allow U.S. investors to trade shares of companies based overseas.
Shares of rival airline Air France-KLM, which combines the airlines of France and the Netherlands, rose 68 cents, or 
2.3 percent, to $30.78.
The Bank of New York Europe ADR index edged up 0.44 points, to 187.75 in Thursday trading as the U.S. market 
finished higher.

Sterling fell to an 11-year low against European currencies yesterday after unexpectedly poor Christmas sales 
figures from one of Britain's leading retailers raised fresh fears about the health of the UK economy.
The weak Marks and Spencer trading statement, which came ahead of a Bank of England meeting to set interest 
rates today, sent shockwaves through retail, airline and travel company shares across Europe.
The FTSE 100 index fell 1.3 per cent, with retail shares having their worst day for 20 years, slumping by 9.6 per 
cent. Similar fears of slowing consumption across Europe pushed the FTSEurofirst 300 index 1.2 per cent lower.
Airline shares were also hard hit with EasyJet's share price tumbling for the second day in succession, closing 7.9 
per cent lower after a fall of 13.9 per cent on Tuesday. Tui Travel fell by 14 per cent, Ryanair by 8.1 per cent and Air 
France-KLM by 5.8 per cent.
Sir Stuart Rose, chief executive of M&S, joined the chorus of retailers calling on the Bank of England to cut rates.
He said: "We need an interest rate reduction. It is the toughest (trading conditions) I have seen in a decade...This is 
not a banana republic, this is Great Britain. But clearly people are very worried."
Sir Stuart's comments came the day after Alistair Darling, the UK chancellor, broke the long-standing convention 
not to put political pressure on the Bank of England over interest rates, arguing it had "room for manoeuvre" on 
monetary policy.
The chancellor's words brought swift condemnation from economists keen to preserve the independence of the 
central bank's monetary policy committee.
Professor Willem Buiter of the London School of Economics, a former MPC member, said Mr Darling should "learn 
and practise the art of silence" when it comes to rates decisions as it is "undermining one of the crowning 
achievements of the Blair-Brown years".
Fears rise for UK economy
The MPC's deliberations over rate cuts were severely complicated by the rapid decline of sterling over the past 
month, as a weaker currency will stimulate the economy and feed into higher import prices.
Sterling dropped another 0.5 per cent against euro yesterday, leaving it at its lowest against that currency since its 
creation in 1999, and its weakest against European currencies since the end of 1996. It also fell 0.7 per cent 
against the dollar to Dollars 1.9575, its lowest level in nine months.
Since peaking against the dollar above Dollars 2.11 in early November, the pound has fallen more than 7 per cent 
against the greenback and has dropped 6.5 per cent against the euro.
Currency analysts said they expected the pound's decline to continue as the Bank of England would be forced to 
cut rates. Ashraf Laidi at CMC Markets said: "We had described the pound as the 'dollar of 2008', and so far it 
hasn't disappointed".

Sterling fell to an 11-year low against European currencies yesterday after worse than expected Christmas trading 
data from Marks and Spencer fuelled fears for the health of the economy and raised pressure on the Bank of 
England to cut interest rates today.
M&S, the nation's biggest clothing chain, reported underlying sales 2.2 per cent down between October and 
December compared with 2006, ending nine quarters of consecutive growth.
As a bellwether for companies whose fortunes are linked to consumer spending, its trading statement had an 
immediate and adverse impact on retail, airline and travel company shares.
The FTSE 100 index fell 1.3 per cent on the day to 6,272.7 points, with retail shares having their worst day for 20 
years, dropping 9.6 per cent. Airline shares were hard hit with EasyJet's share price tumbling 7.9 per cent after a 
fall of 13.9 per cent on Tuesday.
Tui Travel fell 14 per cent, Ryanair 8.1 per cent and Air France-KLM 5.8 per cent. The figures prompted Sir Stuart 
Rose, chief executive of M&S, to call for a swift cut in interest rates.
"We need an interest rate reduction," he said. "It is the toughest (trading conditions) I have seen in a decade . . .

one of the crowning achievements of the Blair-Brown years".
M&S sales data put Bank under rate pressure
The bad news from M&S fed investors' expectations of a rate cut. Although most economists still expect the Bank to 
keep rates at 5.5 per cent, many said a cut would now not surprise them. Futures markets bet that it was more likely 
than not that the MPC would cut rates.
The MPC's deliberations over rate cuts have been complicated by the decline of sterling over the past month as a 
weaker currency will stimulate the economy and feed into higher import prices. Sterling dropped 0.5 per cent 
against the euro yesterday, leaving it at its lowest ever level against the euro - created in 1999 - and its weakest 
level against European currencies since the end of 1996. It fell 0.7 per cent versus the dollar to Dollars 1.9575, its 
lowest point in nine months.
Since peaking against the dollar above Dollars 2.11 in November, the pound has fallen more than 7 per cent and 
against the euro has dropped 6.5 per cent.
Currency analysts expect the pound's fall to go on, as the Bank would be forced to cut interest rates repeatedly. 
"We called the pound the 'dollar of 2008', and it hasn't disappointed," said Ashraf Laidi at CMC Markets.

A dismal performance by European retailers led the continent's stock markets sharply lower yesterday as fears that 
consumers would keep their hands in their pockets bit into sectors ranging from luxury goods to airlines.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 1.2 per cent to 1,449.06 as the woes of the retail sector added to growing worries 
about a global economic slowdown.
"People are worried about a US recession. They are very nervous so they are watching for any bad news from 
companies and are not inclined to accept any bad guidance," said Thierry Lacraz, strategist at Pictet & Cie.
Marks and Spencer, the UK's high street bellwether, reported its worst quarterly sales figures in two years and 
warned of tough times ahead. The news from Britain pummelled European peers.
Sweden's Hennes & Mauritz fell 7.5 per cent to SKr340, France's PPR down 5.3 per cent to Euros 92.20 and 
Spain's Inditex , which owns the Zara chain, dropped 4.3 per cent to Euros 35.08 and Germany's Metro shedding 5 
per cent to Euros 51.20.
Food retailers were also hurt, with Dutch supermarket group Ahold down 1.2 per cent to Euros 8.91, France's 
Carrefour off 1.6 per cent to Euros 49.58.
Poor German retail sales in November released this week pointed to a "less rosy outlook" in the country for 
December and the months to come despite rising job creation, Societe Generale said.
In a rare bright spot, Norwegian retail sales yesterday came in stronger than expected.
Fears that a global economic slowdown will hit consumer spending worldwide also weighed on the airline sector. Air 
France-KLM fell 5.6 per cent to Euros 20.50, after Jean-Cyril Spinetta, chief executive, revealed he will begin talks 
in Rome on Thursday over a possible takeover of Alitalia . The struggling Italian carrier fell 2.5 per cent to Euros 
0.77.
Ryanair slid 6.9 per cent to Euros 3.65 and Deutsche Lufthansa slipped 4.3 per cent to Euros 16.84.

A dismal performance by European retailers led stock markets sharply lower yesterday as fears that consumers 
would keep their hands in their pockets bit into sectors ranging from luxury goods to airlines.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 1.2 per cent to 1,449.06 as the woes of the retail sector added to growing worries 
about a global economic slowdown.
"People are worried about a US recession," said Thierry Lacraz, strategist at Pictet & Cie.
"They are very nervous, so they are watching for any bad news from companies and are not inclined to accept any 
bad guidance."
Marks and Spencer, the UK's high street bellwether, reported its worst quarterly sales figures in two years and 
warned of tough times ahead. The news from Britain pummelled European peers.
Sweden's Hennes & Mauritz fell 7.5 per cent to SKr340, France's PPR was down 5.3 per cent to Euros 92.20, 
Spain's Inditex , which owns the Zara chain, dropped 4.3 per cent to Euros 35.08, and Germany's Metro shed 5 per 
cent to Euros 51.20.
Food retailers were hurt, with Dutch supermarket group Ahold down 1.2 per cent to Euros 8.91 and France's 
Carrefour off 1.6 per cent to Euros 49.58.
Poor German retail sales in November released this week pointed to a "less rosy outlook" in the country for 
December and the months to come despite rising job creation, Societe Generale said.
"As things move forward, chances of seeing a true recovery in household spending start to shrink away," the 
brokerage said.
In a rare bright spot, Norwegian retail sales yesterday came in stronger than expected.
Fears that a global economic slowdown will hit consumer spending worldwide also weighed on the airline sector.
Consumer reticence casts a long shadow
Air France-KLM fell 5.6 per cent to Euros 20.50, after Jean-Cyril Spinetta, chief executive, revealed he would begin 
talks in Rome on Thursday over a possible takeover of Alitalia . The struggling Italian carrier fell 2.5 per cent to 
Euros 0.77.
Ryanair slid 6.9 per cent to Euros 3.65 and Deutsche Lufthansa slipped 4.3 per cent to Euros 16.84.
Investors shunned volatile high-growth stocks, sending the renewable energy sector tumbling with German solar 
power company Q-cells down 6.5 per cent to Euros 84. German chemical company Wacker Chemie , which makes 
the silicon used in solar panels, slid 5.9 per cent to Euros 155.50 and Spanish wind power company Gamesa fell 5 
per cent to Euros 27.31.
French mining company Eramet dropped 6.8 per cent to Euros 300 while ArcelorMittal fell 3.6 per cent to Euros 
46.84 and Sweden's SSAB lost 4.2 per cent to SKr144.75.
"Contagion jitters are spreading and taking a greater toll on market sentiment," Bear Stearns said."
"Things could get a lot worse before they get better. In this environment, the overriding investor strategy should 
continue to be dominated by risk aversion, safe haven and flight to quality," the brokerage added.
Defensive stocks were the main gainers with pharmaceuticals extending their climb. Switzerland's Roche was up 
2.1 per cent at SFr207.70, domestic rival Novartis gained 2.3 per cent at 65.05, Denmark's Novo Nordisk was up 
0.2 per cent to DKr325.50 and Belgium's UCB rose 0.5 per cent to Euros 35.40.
German healthcare equipment maker Fresenius was one of the biggest gainers, rising 4.9 per cent to Euros 59.25.
Utilities also remained in positive territory with Germany's Eon up 1.6 per cent at Euros 151.58, domestic peer RWE

Body
Shares on the Dublin market were trading lower this morning amid growing concerns over the economy and ahead 
of an expected cut in US rates by the Federal Reserve. 
At 10.40am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 187.46 points at 6701.68. 
Also, James Cayne has quit as chief executive of Bear Stearns, adding to a growing list of corporate chiefs pushed 
out by a meltdown in the US home-lending and sub-prime market that has cost big banks billions in losses.
 Investors will now look towards interest rate announcements from the MPC and the ECB tomorrow. Some 
commentators think that UK interest rates will be lowered again but the general expectation is that the MPC will wait 
until next month before lowering rates. ECB rates are widely expected to remain unchanged once again. In the 
financial sector, Bank of Ireland fell 33c to 10.15 and AIB slipped 27c to 15.02. Anglo Irish Bank dropped 17c to

(ANSA) - Florence, January 9 - U.S. air carrier Delta Airlines will increase its flights connecting Pisa, central Italy, 
with New York to five per week from four weekly.
The flight between Pisa and New York, operated by Delta Airlines, was launched on June 1, 2007. The load factor 
of the flight totals 80 pct. Seventy pct of the passengers were U.S. citizens.
In the first half of 2008 Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will launch flights connecting Pisa with Bari, in the southern 
Italian region of Apulia, Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, and Birmingham, central England, and Constanta in 
southern Romania.
Notes
The Galileo Galilei airport in Pisa registered a net profit of 3.22 mln euro ($4.7 mln) in the first nine months of 2007, 
compared to 3.25 mln euro ($4.7 mln) in the same period of 2006, the airport operator Societa Aeroporto Toscano

Europe's leading exchanges rose in midday trade with Wall Street expected to post gains as the flight to safety 
continues with telecoms and healthcare plays posting solid gains once again.
At 12.30 am, the Dow Jones STOXX 50 Index was up 25.79 points or 0.72 pct at 3,619.76, while the DJ STOXX 
600 Index gained 2.34 points or 0.67 pct to 353.61.
Spread bettors IG Index said the Dow looks set to move 41 points up in opening deals, although a bearish note 
from Merrill Lynch suggesting Citigroup may have to make a 16 bln usd writedown in the fourth quarter capped 
enthusiasm.
Later, investors will be looking to see if Wall Street can overcome investor jitters over the US economic outlook to 
add to yesterday's first gains of the year.
Sentiment could take a knock with fresh data expected to confirm the US housing market remains in the doldrums.
The Pending Home Sales Index is expected to have fallen 0.5 pct in November after rising 0.6 pct in the prior 
month, according to the median estimate of economists polled by Thomson's IFR Markets.
Ongoing concerns about the state of the global economy and the banking sector, in particular, continued to weigh 
on the European banking sector.
RBS fell 2.51 pct amid re-emergent rumours it will make a rights issue, while Barclays fell 2.76 pct on vague talk it 
will be forced to make a write-down of underperforming assets.
Lloyds TSB slumped 3.1 pct as Morgan Stanley repeated its 'underweight' stance on the UK banking group, saying 
it is the most exposed UK large-cap bank to the domestic UK economy and has the biggest absolute and relative 
exposure to unsecured credit in the UK.
Societe Generale fell 2.53 pct, BBVA slipped back 1.98 pct and Deutsche Bank was 1.48 pct lower as investors 
remain cautious on the sector.
Euroshares up in midday trade as Dow seen posting gains, defensives up again
In other broker action of note, shares in Deutsche Post rose 3 pct after Morgan Stanley lifted its recommendation on 
the company to 'overweight' from 'equal-weight', saying it expects management changes while a share price level 
close to the 2000 IPO price of 21 eur have 'introduced a new urgency among management' to effect change.
The airline sector took a hit after a number of unimpressive traffic updates. Shares in EasyJet fell 9.73 pct after the 
company's December load factor fell 2.2 percentage points to 78.9 pct, compared to the same period a year ago.
Collins Stewart cut its rating on the shares to 'sell'.
Ryanair Holdings slumped 5.22 pct, hurt by the load factor decline of one of its main competitors. The company is 
also holding a conference in Milan today.
Air France-KLM erased morning gains to turn 2.53 pct lower as early enthusiasm about yields gave way to concern 
about the lacklustre outlook and high oil prices.
The media sector fared better. TF1 reversed opening losses to turn 12.93 pct higher as news of a UBS downgrade 
was outweighed by news the French government is considering banning ads on state TV channels.
A trader in Paris said ad revenues for state-owned TV channels total 700 mln eur and if ads on public TV are 
banned some of this spending will have to be redistributed among the privately owned channels. M6 also moved up 
on the news, adding 7.47 pct.
Shares in Premiere gained for a second day, up 2.09 pct, buoyed by rumours of a bid from either Vivendi or 
NewsCorp following yesterday News Corp has bought a 14.5 pct stake in the company.
Dresdner Kleinwort lifted its rating to 'buy' from 'hold' on the German Pay-TV group, saying it is unlikely News Corp 
will be content to remain a minority shareholder.
The broker pointed out the last time News had a stake in the business management highlighted that a key 
frustration in the run up to Kirch's bankruptcy was their lack of control.
Lagardere shares rose 4.3 pct after UBS upgraded the company to 'buy' from 'neutral'. The broker also lifted Havas 
-- up 1.56 pct -- to 'buy' from 'neutral'.
The staffing sector also posted solid morning gains, helped by an upbeat outlook from UK group Michael Page 
International.
Investec said today's update confirms trading in the fourth quarter has remained strong across the group, with little 
impact from the world credit crunch seen to date. The broker repeated its 'buy' stance saying shares in the sector 
have been badly hit by concerns over the outlook for 2008.
Michael Page was up 7.86 pct. Among other sector gainers, Hays rose 4.26 pct, Adecco added 1.45 pct while 
Randstad added 1.23 pct.
Selected tech stocks also posted gains with Atos Origin up 3.18 pct after it was upgraded to 'buy' from 'hold'.
Autonomy climbed 5.47 pct after it announced it has entered into OEM license agreements with Oracle and EMC 
for the license of its software. Singulus Technologies extended yesterday's gains -- rising a further 21.99 pct -- after 
the company's chief executive officer Stefan Baustert said in an interview he expects the company to win orders for 
at least 15 Blu-ray machines this year, three times more than last year.
And Fast Search & Transfer surged 38.58 after US computer giant Microsoft Corp made a 19 nkr cash bid for the 
group.

Leading European shares are set to open slightly higher this morning, after a mixed session in the US yesterday 
with broker action a key focus on a relatively quiet news day.
Last night, the DJIA ended up 27.31 points, or 0.21 pct, at 12,827.49, after moving in and out of positive territory 
throughout the session as investors grew more confident that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates again 
later this month to ward off recession
The market also contended with a resurgence of tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
The tech-focused Nasdaq composite index fell 5.19, or 0.21 pct, to 2,499.46.
Over in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed up 28.12 points, or 0.2 pct, at 14,528.67. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng 
finished the morning up 283.34 points or 1.04 pct at 27,462.83.
Oil prices were higher in morning Asian trade today, rebounding from overnight falls in New York on concerns over 
the United States economy.
In morning trade, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for February delivery gained 52 cents to 95.61 usd a 
barrel from 95.09 in late US trades Monday.
Brent North Sea crude for February was up 50 cents at 94.89 dollars a barrel.
Prices had briefly risen in US trading hours after the Pentagon said three US warships had been briefly harassed on 
Sunday by Iranian speedboats in the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial gateway for global energy supplies.
Back in Europe, Airlines will be in focus with traffic statistics out from Easyjet and Air France-KLM and as Ryanair 
hosts a conference in Milan today.
Three companies may be interested in buying Airbus SAS's Laupheim, Germany, operations. Concrete offers for 
the 1,100-employee factory may follow by mid-February. The three interested buyers are Diehl Group, Bremen-
based Kaefer and Zodiac, according to Handelsblatt.
M&A news is mostly dominated by posturing from Xstrata and Scottish & Newcastle as the former says the 
production targets set by its Australian takeover target Resource Pacific Holdings Ltd. aren't achievable and the 
Euroshares outlook - set to tick higher after modest Dow gains
brewing group says it commissioned an independent report which shows that joint venture Baltic Beverages was 
grossly undervalued when Carlsberg and Heineken NV made an informal offer for S&N in October.
Elsewhere, the Daily Telegraph said Portugal's Banco Espirito has acquired almost 10 pct of UK broker and 
investment bank Evolution Group Plc and may make a full takeover offer.
And Zurich Financial Services is reportedly considering buying a Taiwanese insurer to expand in the greater China 
region, reversing a strategy of shrinking its operations on the island. The insurer will review possible takeover 
targets among Taiwanese property insurance providers.
In other news, biotech group InterMune Inc said that phase 1b studies on potential hepatitis C drug ITMN-191, 
which it is developing in cooperation with Roche Holdings AG, have shown positive results.
The multiple ascending dose (MAD) study tested the drug's efficiency safety and tolerability at a 300 mg daily 
dosage as monotherapy.
Given the relatively thin newsflow, trade will likely be dominated by yet another slew of New Year broker changes.
Deutsche Bank upped Dassault Systemes and Atos Origin to 'buy' but cut Cap Gemini to hold'.
The broker also cut UBI Banca and Intesa SanPaolo to 'hold'.
Meanwhile, in a series of media sector reviews, UBS has cut Johnston Press and Yell to 'sell' and TF1 to 'neutral' 
but upped Havas and Lagardere to 'buy'.
Endesa has been upped to 'buy' at Citigroup.
And Credit Suisse has cut the European Telecoms sector to 'market weight' from 'overweight'.

Ryanair Holdings PLC's proposal to set up operations at Milan's Malpensa airport have been rejected by SEA, the 
company that operates the airport, said Bridget Dowling, Ryanair's market and sales director for Southern Europe.
Last year, Ryanair proposed to SEA basing 15 aircraft at Malpensa and generating passenger traffic of 6 mln 
passengers per year.
'As far as Malpensa is concerned we have made an offer and it has not been accepted. Our door is always open,' 
for further talks with SEA, Dowling said, declining to go into details.
Alitalia SpA, also via its tie up with Air France-KLM, is planning to downscale its operations at Malpensa to have 
only one hub in Italy at Fiumicino in Rome.
Dowling said Italy is Ryanair's second-largest market and is aiming for 14 mln passengers in 2008, up from 12 mln 
in 2007, with the longer term goal of doubling routes and passengers over 5 years.

MF Global has upgraded Rio Tinto from neutral to buy. The broker thinks its earlier downgrade was premature and 
says higher iron ore and coal prices, and the potential of a rebound in aluminium prices, will help the stock.
Consolidation in the sector is also a factor. MF does not think the other big miners will sit on the sidelines while BHP 
gets the better of Rio with what now looks to be a 'significantly inadequate' offer.
*****
Merrill Lynch is a buyer of Morrisons and expects like-for-like sales up 5% for the six weeks trading to 6 January. It 
is neutral on Sainsbury and a buyer of Tesco.
In the property sector, among the majors the broker prefers Hammerson and SEGRO; among the mid and small 
groups it opts for Helical Bar, Big Yellow and Safestore.
Its five most preferred stocks for the month are Informa, Ipos, Pearson, Vivendi and WPP; the least preferred are 
Independent, ITV, Johnston Press, Mediaset and Telecinco.
*****
After various trading updates, Numis is a buyer of Domino's Pizza, Dunelm Group, Mecom and Topps Tiles.
*****
Dresdner Kleinwort is another buyer of Topps Tiles, despite the modest weakening of the sales trend. The market is 
tough and could get worse before it gets better, say the analysts Sanjay Vidyarthi and Geoff Lowery in a note.
They maintain their bottom of consensus estimates for 2008, but point out that this is a quality retailer on an 
attractive valuation with among the lowest earnings sensitivity to sales assumptions.
In midcaps the broker's strongest recommendations are Northgate and James Fisher.
*****
Arden Partners is a buyer of Brammer, Dunelm, Greenko, Hardy Oil & Gas, Helphire, Kewill, Meggitt and 
Pendragon. It puts sell recommendations on Misys and Tomkins.
Broker Notes: Buy Rio as miners won't let BHP win with inadequate offer
*****
Growing traffic, but a fall in the load factor is why Collins Stewart has put out a sell note on easyJet.
Meanwhile the broker is a buyer of Air France-KLM, Aer Lingus and British Airways. It has a hold recommendation 
on Ryanair.
Collins Stewart also recommends buying food producer Parmalat and expects a strong dividend this year. On small 
cap companies, the broker is a buyer of Cape.
*****
Panmure Gordon has put out buy notes on Alterian, Micro Focus and Autonomy. It recommends Morse as a hold.
*****
Citigroup has cut in rating on Keller Group to hold from buy, it says Man Group should be bought on weakness and 
remains a buyer of Marshalls, but it has reduced its price target to 300p.
The broker rates Michael Page Group as a high risk hold and has set a price target of 500p.
*****
Morgan Stanley is overweight on Vodafone and has raised its price target 5% to 215p.
*****
Deutsche Bank retains its hold recommendation on Mitchells & Butlers. While there is scope for more merger 
activity, the broker says there is a risk of a slowdown in the eating out market, a worse than expected outcome from 
the smoking ban and a fall in pub property values.
Meanwhile it says to hold Scottish & Southern and but Playtech.
*****
Altium says to hold GCap Media, but buy Domino's Pizza, Arden Partners and Michael Page.
*****
Evolution is a buyer of Lamprell and Michael Page, but recommends reducing Micro Focus.
*****
Keefe Bruyette & Woods has Man Group as outperform with a target price of 700p, up from 626p.
The broker says after the spin off of MF Global, the group has become a more streamlined, highly cash generative, 
pure-play hedge fund.
*****
Landsbanki is a buyer of ARC International, Dunelm, Michael Page, ProStrakan, Topps Tiles, Xaar and CODA. It 
recommends holding Ark Therapeutics.

JP Morgan remains overweight of BAE Systems and sees a 15% upside. It remains neutral on QinetiQ, but adds

Irish Ryanair Presents New Offer to Italy Malpensa
Irish Ryanair Presents New Offer to Italy Malpensa

(ANSA) - Milan, January 8 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair announced its willingness to work with the airport of 
Malpensa located near Milan, in the northern Italian region of Lombardy, by making it a new offer.
The offer for Malpensa to improve the traffic in northern Italy by working with Rayaniar was announced by Bridget 
Dowling, South Europe Marketing and Sales Manager of the Irish carrier. Ryaniar offers Malpensa one million free 
tickets for the passengers who will book a seat before January 10, 2007.
The airport of Milan does not want to become a low cost air transport hub and this is the reason the airport's 
management does not want to work with the Irish carrier, Dowling commented.
Notes
Ryaniar presented a plan to Malpensa in September 2007 after Alitalia reorganised its plan but the airport's 
management company did not take the Irish offer, media reported on January 8, 2008. Ryanair planes fly from Orio 
al Serio airport in Bergamo, east of Milan.

Seat of government
There is a long tradition of pompous politicians and other jumped up dignitaries turning up at airports and 
demanding last-minute first-class seats on flights operated by flag carriers, often when they are returning Prada-
laden from shopping trips to London or Paris - leaving paying passengers dumped at the gate.
It's the sort of thing you expect in countries where there is a shady line between the assets of the state and those 
currently running the state.
So it has done Sri Lanka's image no good to learn that Peter Hill, chief executive of SriLankan Airlines, faces losing 
his work permit because he refused to bump 35 passengers from a full Heathrow to Colombo flight to make way for 
the country's president and his entourage. The president had been in the UK on a personal visit. At least Hill's 
employer Emirates, which owns a 43% stake in SriLankan, and from whom Hill has been on secondment for almost 
a decade, is standing behind him.
Keeping abreast
Headline from last month's Air International:
BRA suspends operations.
Quirk Douglas
Not that we at Budgie News should be the first to cast a stone, but we were intrigued at what is on offer from 
Discovery Travel, which is offering Cairo to the Cape trips aboard a "DC 9 Havilland veteranfly" alongside a picture 
of a DC-3 (below).
Way out
No Headline In Original
Reader Johan Rebel points out the recruitment ad in the 4-10 December issue of Budgie News which promises "an 
exiting job" with Europe's biggest aerospace company. "I wonder what that entails?" ponders Johan. "Testing 
evacuation shutes perhaps? Doing the dry run on ejection seats? Now that would be exciting."
Floating in a
most peculiar
Sir Richard Branson has been experiencing the effect of weightlessness during simulator training in preparation for 
his flight on SpaceShipTwo, the suborbital vehicle being developed by Virgin Galactic and Burt Rutan of Scaled 
Composites. Given the wobbles of the bearded businessman's foray on to the stock market back in the 1980s (he 
went private again after a year) we are glad to hear this was one Virgin flotation which went well.
No departure from form
We realise giving Ryanair the oxygen of gratuitious publicity is like offering a bottle of scotch to an alcoholic or a 
platinum charge card to a Premiership footballer's girlfriend. But we were amused by the carrier's latest release 
about its superior punctuality compared with EasyJet - or as Ryanair dubs its no-frills rivalLazyJet. Great, if you can 
endure, as one Budgie correspondent did last week, the likes of Ryanair's tin shed of a "dedicated terminal" in 
Tampere, Finland, where two check-in staff processed three full 737-800 departures taking off within two hours of 
each other, amid a queuing system that made the dash for the last helicopter out of Saigon look organised. Still, the 
flight got away on time.

ISEQ slumps on CRH speculation

The Dublin market slumped by over 100 points in morning trading as investors digested media speculation that 
CRH is suspending the purchase of Tarmac because of turmoil in the money markets.
By 11:00, the ISEQ index was down 101.19 points to 6,875.94.
CRH shares plunged by 30c to E24.95 amid press speculation this morning that the purchase of Anglo American's 
Tarmac subsidiary for E4bn has been postponed due to the turmoil in the credit markets.
 Other builders also fell with Grafton down 21c to E5.29 and Kingspan declined by 14c to E10.86. The global 
economy also weighed on investor sentiment. While oil prices drew back from last week's historic USD100 a barrel 
level and the euro lost some ground to the dollar today, fears of a recession hitting the world's biggest economy this 
year have grown forcing equities investors to flee to 'safer' bets for their cash. The US Federal Reserve is widely 
tipped to drop interest rates by another quarter point at its next meeting in an effort to stave off slowing economic 
growth but some analysts are predicting that even this may not be enough to hold back a recession by the second 
half of this year. "The marked slowdown in job creation in the US in December, coupled with a significant rise in the 
unemployment rate, raises the risk that US economic growth will slow more markedly in the quarters ahead," 
according to Goodbody economist, Dermot O'Leary. However, interest rate decisions on this side of the Atlantic 
take centre stage this week, with both the Bank of England and the ECB due to announce their decisions on 
Thursday. Current market expectations imply no change for both but inflationary pressure are building in the 
eurozone and a rate hike is being pencilled in soon by some economists. As usual, banks and builders bore the 
brunt of the uncertainty. Banks also dragged the index lower with AIB down 18c to E15.31, Bank of Ireland lost 5c 
to E10.30, Anglo Irish fell by 20c to E10.18 and Irish Life and Permanent shed 25c to E11.55. Goodbody notes that 
2008 has started off badly for Europe's airlines with a weakened Sterling and surging oil prices. The UK currency 
accounts for about 45pc of Ryanair's revenues, and over 10pc of Aer Lingus' total revenues and both shares have 
ISEQ slumps on CRH speculation
felt the effects. Ryanair shares fell by 10c to E4.04 this morning and have plunged by more than 60c in the past 
three weeks. Aer Lingus shares were flat in morning trade but suffered from last Thursday's oil price spike.

Aer Lingus wants to cut costs by EUR20 million euros to help stave off the threat posed by rival budget carriers 
such as Ryanair. The National Implementation Body said in December proposals for a deal had been reached on 
finding EUR10 million in savings with the remaining EUR10 million to be negotiated. Aer Lingus said it welcomed 
SIPTU's stance. Aer Lingus, which has been battling with unions to cut overheads since its privatization in 2006, 
averted flight disruptions in October after reaching a last-minute deal with pilots over a disputed new base in 
Northern Ireland. The former state carrier's announcement in August that it was transferring London Heathrow slots 
from Shannon in Ireland to Belfast angered pilots who say staff at the new base will be employed on less favorable 
pay and conditions. Jan 3, 2008
Aer Lingus Workers Agree Mediator Plan On Pay. Aer Lingus workers agreed on Thursday to a plan proposed by a 
mediator aimed at averting industrial action by staff over working conditions. In November Irish union SIPTU called 
off planned airport stoppages to give more time for talks with Aer Lingus management and Ireland's industrial 
relations mediator, the National Implementation Body (NIB). The dispute centered on plans by the airline to change 
working conditions for temporary employees. Jan 3, 2008

Despite a relaxation of rules restricting the number of bags passengers can take aboard flights from the UK, 
Ryanair is sticking with its one-bag quota.
The airline said the changes make no difference to its policy of passengers being permitted to carry on board a 
single piece of hand luggage, weighing no more than 10kg. 
A limit of one carry-on bag per passenger was introduced in Britain in August 2006 and the measure led to 
complaints from travellers, airlines and airports as a surge in checked-in items caused longer waiting times.

Malta and Gozo are experiencing a significant increase in tourist numbers on the back of various low-cost airlines 
commencing flights to the islands.
From an Irish perspective, the launch earlier this year of direct Ryanair flights has made this a far more accessible 
destination.
The property market in Malta and Gozo is a mature and pretty expensive one, with mortgage finance readily 
available from local banks. It has tax advantages for the well-heeled and has attracted considerable attention from 
well-to-do Irish investors. As of last week Malta is using the euro as its official currency.
Malta Gozo Property is currently promoting a development in a specially created hilltop village, with views of a 
country valley and the sea beyond.
Madliena Village is a gated development of apartments within a short walk of the medieval hill village of Gharghur. It 
is located on the Madliena hillside, one of Malta's most prestigious addresses.
The properties come with traditional balconies and terraces to make the most of the views and temperate climate. It 
is a secure environment, with pedestrian pathways and a condominium service to take care of maintenance and 
general administration.
A key feature is the large open-air swimming pool that looks out over the valley, and can be used for seven months 
of the year. The development is set in a quiet area a few minutes' drive from busy shopping and entertainment 
centres. The choice of apartments is varied, but all come with terraces and garages.
The units will be sold ready to move into with flooring, light fittings, full air-conditioning, telecom connections and 
bathrooms.
Madliena Village is a special designated area, so foreigners can purchase as many units as they please.
Happy days in Malta
Prices for a 74 square metre one-bedroom apartment start from just under  233,000 and details are available from 
02320813 or online at www.maltagozoproperty.com.

Ryanair fails to take off on traffic rise

Ryanair yesterday revealed it carried 18 per cent more passengers in December than a year ago.
But shares in the low-cost airline remained under pressure as soaring crude prices, an uncertain outlook in the 
global economy and a weak pound prompted jittery investors to take flight.
Passenger volume rose from 3.36m last December to 3.95m - in line with analyst expectations. Nonetheless, 
shares in the Irish carrier fell 13 cent to Euros 4.14 yesterday. The fall comes in the wake of Thursday's 5.8 per cent 
slide.
Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy, the Irish stockbroker, said the market was waiting for guidance on revenue per 
seat when the group gives its third quarter trading update next month. "You can't read too much into traffic 
numbers, especially not a one-month figure," he said. "While passenger volume is clearly up, what the market really 
wants to see is underlying passenger number. We won't get a sense of what profit will be like until we get numbers 
on passenger yield and ancillary revenues."
In November, Ryanair said yields, or average fares, will decrease by at least 5 per cent in the second half, as a 
result of higher travel taxes and a consumer spending slowdown in the UK, its biggest market.
The company has responded to the decline by charging passengers for priority boarding and checked bags to 
increase ancillary revenues.
Ancillary revenues - which include commission earnings from hotel, car rental and travel insurance bookings and 
checked in baggage charges - accounted for 16 per cent of turnover during the first half of the financial year and the 
airline has set a target of increasing it to 20 per cent.
*British Airways reported a 1 per cent increase in passenger traffic as premium traffic was up 6.5 per cent in 
December, compared with a 0.1 per cent gain in economy traffic.

Why trains beat planes (almost always)

In Europe at least, international train travel is enjoying a renaissance. The ever more popular Eurostar between 
London and Paris, Spain's expanding network of AVE high-speed trains, the ICE network in Germany - just as we 
are beginning to understand that criss- crossing the world by air may leave very little of the world for our children to 
criss-cross at all, it looks as though an older, slower, greener and altogether more satisfying way of travel has 
smartened up its offerings.
Unfortunately for the planet, the rail revolution is not going to happen until the rail companies take a hard look at the 
appeal of flying - speed aside. We, as travellers, also need to rethink what we want out of a journey. Meanwhile, 
train travel can involve a series of minor but very palpable frustrations.
It starts with buying a ticket. As air travellers, we tend to work out that we want to go from A to B, spend an hour or 
so entering dates on various websites and consider the difference between prices at different times of the day.
Going by train is more complicated. For a start, you're not really going from A to B - you're going from A to H, with a 
connection in J, catching a ferry to K and arriving in B 24 hours later. That's half the fun, of course, but it means 
interacting with a number of different ticketing systems, not all of which work as smoothly as they should.
Luckily, to help them through this maze, rail travellers can draw on a resource greater than anything air travellers 
could even dream of.
The website The Man in Seat 61, run as a labour of love by a man called Mark Smith (he gets some income from 
the ads, but that's about it), will tell you everything you want to know about train travel almost anywhere in the world 
- though it works best if you are setting off in the UK. It tells you about times, prices, ticketing arrangements, routes 
to avoid and even on-board catering. And, in astonishing detail, it tells you the best way to buy a ticket. It was 
through The Man in Seat 61 that I found I should buy the second leg of my journey first because it would give me a 
discount that wasn't available the other way round. That's when you really appreciate a railway geek.
But whatever discounts you stumble across, chances are that your train trip will cost you a lot more than the same 
journey by air. One New Year trip that I made from London to Rome cost me almost 10 times the Ryanair fare - a 
Why trains beat planes (almost always)
fact that drew howls of incredulity from my friends as they hopped on to the airport express. But the mistake, of 
course, is not to compare like with like.
Blame it on the internet, blame it on the Wright brothers, but modern life has lulled us into assuming that the faster 
something is, the better - and that if it is better, it should cost more.
Train travel challenges that. Unlike the white-knuckle ride of flying, trains start almost imperceptibly; sometimes you 
notice you are on your way only as the platform slips behind you. And they give you time - time to walk around, the 
think, to doze. You can join fellow passengers for a game of cards or take a stroll through the carriages, standing by 
an open window and feeling the rush of cold air. Or, as I did a couple of years ago on that trip to Italy, you can sit in 
the dining car with a bottle of wine and a good book and watch the carriage lights catch the ice on the tracks as you 
ascend into the Alps.
Travelling by train means the first and last days of your holiday are usually spent getting there and back. Think of 
this as time to decompress, adjust and anticipate. In my book that is well worth the extra cost.
But some aspects of train travel do make the cost hard to swallow: travelling second-class on a train is not always 
more comfortable than flying economy. Spain's Trenhotel services from France, for example, are clean and simple 
but some of the seats in second appear to have been designed by someone who has never sat down. And there is 
something odd about sleeping perpendicular to the direction of travel. (Still, not as odd as sleeping upright with a 
crying baby behind you and the cabin crew pushing past a trolley full of booze).
And there is the bureaucracy. On a trip to Spain last year, I had my bag stolen from the villa I stayed in, and, with it, 
my return train ticket. Had I been with flying with almost any European airline, I would barely have noticed the 
inconvenience, and could have just popped to an internet cafe to print off my e-ticket from the website. Not so with 
long-distance rail travel: I had a numbered seat with an assigned couchette, my name was on the ticket and on the 
passenger list - but the rail company would not issue a duplicate. Instead, they said I had to buy a new ticket and, 
although we knew there would be an empty seat with my name on it, they couldn't guarantee a place.
In the end, the rail company and I reached a compromise but, like all poor customer service, it left an annoying 
taste in my mouth.

Shares on the Dublin market were trading higher this morning as oil prices held below USD100 and a strong 
performance by the financials. 
At 10.40am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 99.19 points at 7080.95. 
Oil prices held steady in early trade as the market paused for breath after yesterday's fresh all-time high above 
USD100, the result of a US Dept of Energy inventory report that showed US crude stocks fell by more than 
expected last week. 
 Prices initially fell to day lows following the report, which also showed an increase in heating oil stocks and a rise in 
refinery utilisation, before buyers stepped in to send crude to a new record of USD100.09. In the financial sector, 
Bank of Ireland rose 15c to 10.55 and AIB climbed 29c to 15.75. Anglo Irish Bank rose 5c to 10.70 and Irish Life 
and Permanent was up 11c to 11.80. Construction shares were mixed. Kingspan rose 7c to 11.10 and Grafton was 
up 19c to 5.45. McInerney was down 1c at 1.44. CRH increased 62c to 25.62. Elsewhere, shares at no-frills airline 
Ryanair slipped 12c to 4.21 and Irish pharmaceutical company Elan rose 29c to 15.91. Other notable movers 
include Smurfit Kappa up 15c to 11.41, FBD up 25c to 25.90 and DCC up 49c to 20.20. Shares at Fyffes rose 4c to 
1.05 after it issued a trading update this morning in which it increased its guidance. For FY07 it has increased its 
adjusted EBIT from E15m to E17m, due to higher selling prices and favourable exchange rates. Also, shares at 
Dragon remained flat at 4.86 after it released a Production and Drilling Update. Among the highlights of the piece 
was the announcement that a new gross peak production record of 40,038 bopd has been achieved. Dzheitune 
(Lam) A/123 is now in production and yielding an initial combined flow rate of 3,284 bopd. In the statement Mr 
Sultan, Chairman and CEO, notes that, "the flow rate from this well is consistent with the results from the previous 
three wells drilled in this area." The "Iran Khazar" rig has spudded a further development well, Dzheitune (Lam) 
A/125, with a target depth of 4,390 metres. While the "CIS-1" rig is currently completing the development well,

Shares on the Dublin market closed the week on a low note with financial shares especially taking a hit, following 
weak US jobs data. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 64.86 points at 6916.90 
The US economy created jobs at its slowest pace in more than four years, while the unemployment rate hit a level 
not seen in more than two years, the Labour Department said
 The economy added just 18,000 jobs in December, the smallest monthly gain since August 2003, the low point of 
job creation when the economy lost 42,000 jobs. December's gain is far below the 111,000 average monthly gain in 
2007 and just a fraction of the 100,000 jobs the economy needs to keep up with new entrants to the workforce In 
the financial sector, Bank of Ireland fell 20c to 10.20 and AIB slipped 19c to 15.27. Anglo Irish Bank was down 37c 
to 10.28 and Irish Life and Permanent decreased 19c to 11.50. Construction shares were mixed. Kingspan fell 3c to 
11.00 and Grafton was up 14c to 5.40 after it said that it expects trading in the full year 2007 to be in line or a little 
below expectations but said the Irish housing slump will impact trading. McInerney was down 2c at 1.43. CRH 
slipped 5c to 24.95. The number of new house builds slumped by a staggering 47pc in 2007 compared to 2006 with 
December having the lowest monthly new home starts since records began, according to housing agency 
Homebond. Builders' appetites for starting new housing projects remained weak in December, with housing 
registrations falling by 60pc on the same month a year earlier While Homebond is the biggest of the two companies 
that provide the registrations data, we must wait for the Premier data to get the full picture for the final month of the 
year. This is likely to be released next week," according to Dermot O'Leary, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers. 
"Nevertheless, it is clear that the trend in housing starts continued to deteriorate in the final quarter of 2007 
"Homebond registrations fell by 61pc year-on-year in Q4, while the number of houses registered in the second half 
of the year was 42pc less than the H1 total. "These trends will thus be reflected in completions and employment 
data as we progress through 2008. "Our forecast for house completions in 2008 stands at 50,000. In our view, the 
ISEQ closes week on a low note
degree of variability around this number is quite small given the inherent lags involved with commencing a unit and 
completing it. Nevertheless, should the recent trends continue, it may provide downside risks to our 50,000 units 
estimate for 2009," he said Elsewhere, shares at no-frills airline Ryanair slipped 27c to 4.06 and Irish 
pharmaceutical company Elan fell 22c to 15.40. Other notable movers include Kerry Group down 30c to 21.95, FBD

Deutsche Borse
extended its losses into a second day as investors took profits in the face of record oil prices and fears of slowing 
economic growth.
The German stock exchange operator fell 3.3 per cent to Euros 124.64 after volume growth on its trading platforms 
slowed in December. Rumours swirled that hedge funds TCI and Atticus were selling stakes in the German 
exchange and with headwinds building in Europe's economy, traders said it was time to take profits in one of last 
year's best performers. The stock price almost doubled in 2007.
The benchmark pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged 0.2 per cent lower to 1,484.83, with stakebuilding talk and 
rising oil companies offsetting losses by retailers after poor results and a weak economic outlook from peers in the 
UK.
Spanish fashion retailer Inditex , which owns the Zara chain, fell 2.3 per cent to Euros 41.19, Swedish rival H&M 
lost 3 per cent to SKr374.50, while France's PPR lost 4 per cent to Euros 104.83. Germany's Metro fell 2.7 per cent 
to Euros 53.99.
Slowing growth was also seen in the technology sector with Dutch TomTom tumbling 7.2 per cent to Euros 47.96. 
The world's largest maker of car navigation equipment fell sharply after telling analysts that its sales were slowing.
Rising oil prices buffeted airlines and other stocks with high exposure to fuel costs. Ryanair
, the Irish budget carrier, fell 7 per cent to Euros 4.27, while Lufthansa lost 2.5 per cent to Euros 17.75 and Air 
France-KLM
shed 1.5 per cent to Euros 23.28.
The oil price boosted energy companies, which were among the day's biggest gainers, with Gaz de France up 4.6 
per cent to Euros 41.49 and Total up 2.4 per cent to Euros 57.65.
D Borse falls on talk of stake sales
Carmakers suffered, with Germany's Daimler slipping 2.7 per cent to Euros 62.91, domestic rival BMW dropping 1.5 
per cent to Euros 42.09, Volkswagen losing 1.6 per cent to Euros 151.81 and France's Peugeot and Renault 
dropping 2.7 per cent and 2.3 per cent to Euros 49.90 and Euros 93.54 respectively.

The German stock exchange operator fell 3.3 per cent to Euros 124.64 after volume growth on its trading platforms 
slowed in December. Rumours swirled that hedge funds TCI and Atticus were selling stakes in the German 
exchange and with headwinds building in Europe's economy, traders said it was time to take profits in one of last 
year's best performers. The stock price almost doubled in 2007.
The benchmark pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged 0.2 per cent lower to 1,484.83, with stakebuilding talk and 
strength in the oil sector offsetting losses by retailers after poor results and a weak economic outlook from peers in 
the UK.
Spanish fashion retailer Inditex , which owns the Zara chain, fell 2.3 per cent to Euros 41.19, Swedish rival H&M 
lost 3 per cent to SKr374.50, while France's PPR lost 4 per cent to Euros 104.83. Germany's Metro fell 2.7 per cent

Slowing growth was also seen in the technology sector with Dutch TomTom tumbling 7.2 per cent to Euros 47.96. 
The world's largest maker of car navigation equipment fell sharply after telling analysts that its sales were slowing.

Body
A South African aviation entrepreneur has taken a 15.4 per cent stake in Germany's Air Berlin, putting the majority 
of the low-cost carrier's stock into the hands of two groups of airline-industry insiders.
Investors saw the move as a sign that an airline leading the consolidation of German aviation could itself soon be 
up for sale. Its stock rose 10 per cent to Euros 13.66, valuing the group at about Euros 900m (Dollars 1.3bn).
Europe's third-largest budget carrier has bought three national rivals since going public 18 months ago, but its 
share price fell by a quarter last year as it reported problems integrating LTU, a large charter airline.
Air Berlin's founders and top management own 35 per cent of the company - in parcels ranging from 0.22 per cent 
to 7.6 per cent - but have recently signalled a willingness to - at least - dilute their stakes.
Their share in the company could shrink by up to a third at the start of next year, when Air Berlin plans to pay 
Thomas Cook, the UK travel group, in new shares and cash for Condor, another charter carrier.
Air Berlin yesterday said Berlin-based Vatas Holdings - controlled by South African Rob Hersov - had become its 
single biggest shareholder, apparently after no more than cursory contact at investor meetings.
Air Berlin said the company had no information about its new investor's intentions. Mr Hersov, who lives and works 
in London, declined to comment.
Mr Hersov has previously profited from airline consolidation. He sold Marquis Jets, an executive jet service, to 
Netjets, a US rival, in 2004 and remains vicechairman of Netjets Europe.
He also owned stakes in Freenet, a German telecoms group, which last year unsuccessfully sought to merge with 
rival Talkline, and Balda, a high-tech company once mooted to be looking at a deal in the US.
Since going public in 2006, Air Berlin has bought German carriers dba and LTU, and committed to buying Condor in 
early 2009 - a cash-and-shares deal that still needs approval from national cartel authorities.
S African investor buys into Air Berlin
Depending on the carrier's valuation at that time, Thomas Cook, its current owner, could end up holding almost 30 
per cent in the merged group via a capital increase that would dilute existing Air Berlin stakes.
Air Berlin's strategy of making acquisitions has set it apart from rivals Ryanair and EasyJet, which have favoured 
organic growth. The strategy has meant Air Berlin is an unusual hybrid of low-cost and charter airline.
Air Berlin said last week Deutsche Bank held 15.02 per cent of its stock. The German lender, which helped the 
company go public, has long held a stake of more than 8 per cent.

"If the oil price continues to climb, it is bad news for Europe. The short-run impact is inflationary, but ultimately it will

A US slowdown would reverberate in Europe with exporters such as car companies among the big losers, he said.

Budget operator Air Berlin surged 10.2 per cent to Euros 13.69 after stakebuilding by holding group Vatas, which 
holds 15.4 per cent of the voting rights through its Haarlem One subsidiary.
Deutsche Postbank bucked the weaker financial sector, rising 2.9 per cent to Euros 63.01, as speculation 
intensified that Germany's biggest retail bank would be up for sale later this year.
Commerzbank is in the frame as a possible buyer.
Adidas , the world's second-largest sporting goods maker, edged up 0.1 per cent to Euros 50.00 with talk of a 
Russian investor buying a stake of between 5 and 25 per cent, which could lay the foundations for an eventual 
takeover, dealers said.
Meanwhile, CRH

It said travellers were being charged extra for services that used to be included in the price of a ticket, such as 
checking luggage into the hold and reserving a seat on a flight.
Monarch Airlines started charging Pounds 3.99 per bag checked into the hold in November. Easyjet, Bmibaby, 
Flybe and Ryanair also charge fees for putting bags into the hold. Among these airlines, only Ryanair charges for 
checking in at an airport desk.
Which? has reported its concerns to the Air Users Transport Council. Jenny Wiggins

Economic growth is likely to slow down to 2.1pc - the lowest rate of growth by the Irish economy since 1991, Davy 
Research said today.
The broker said in a note today, "Given the magnitude of the correction that is underway in the housing market, 
GNP growth is likely to slow down to 2.1pc - the lowest rate of growth by the Irish economy since 1991.
"However, once we get through the other side of the housing correction, we expect the economy to return closer to 
trend growth rates. Davy Research expects GNP growth to bounce back to 3.8pc in 2009."
 Meanwhile, Davy expects Irish financial stocks to perform strongly in the second half of the year on the assumption 
that current global funding concerns abate. CRH and Ryanair are also likely to outperform given the overly 
pessimistic outlook implied in their ratings, it said. Robbie Kelleher, head of research, said: "Virtually all of the fall in 
the ISEQ in 2007 reflected a de-rating of the market rather than any material reduction in earnings estimates. We 
now have the lowest aggregate forward rating for the market since records began in the mid 1980s. Earnings 
growth is forecast to be in high single-digits in both 2008 and 2009 so something has to give. "Valuations are now 
discounting economic outcomes in both Ireland and abroad that seem highly improbable. We expect the economy 
to bounce back in 2009 and that prospect should begin to be reflected in the stock market this year," he said.

Polish treasury says could dump whole stake in LOT airline sell-off
Polish treasury says could dump whole stake in LOT airline sell-off

Poland could get rid of the entire stake it holds in national airline LOT after an initial public offering later this year 
and does not rule out selling part of the carrier to another airline, a deputy treasury minister said.
Zdzislaw Gawlik told Thomson Financial News in an interview that the public offering of LOT, in which the state now 
holds a 68 pct stake, is 'a foregone conclusion' and could take place in June or July.
'It's in the interest of the company, considering its investment needs, for the shares to start trading publicly as 
quickly as possible,' Gawlik said.
Like other flagship carriers, LOT has come under pressure from budget airlines such as WizzAir and Irish Ryanair, 
which have cut into its market share as thousands of Poles took to flying on holiday and as many as two million left 
to work abroad in recent years.
The airline has recently announced plans to open new links with Asia to offset growing competition on European 
and transatlantic routes and raise the net profit to 200 mln zlotys in 2012.
'When it comes to an initial public offering of LOT it will consist of a new share issue,' Gawlik said. 'We cannot rule 
out that a sector investor will take part in a privatisation.'
Gawlik said the government expects to reach an agreement later this month with the receiver of bankrupt SwissAir, 
which still controls a 25 pct stake in LOT.
The deputy treasury minister also said he saw no reason for the state to hold any shares in the national airline, but 
said cutting the treasury's stake in the carrier below 51 pct will require legal changes.
The move could prove tricky for the government as previous attempts to sell high-profile, state-owned assets have 
led to heated debates in parliament.
LOT, a member of the Lufthansa-led Star Alliance, flew 3.7 mln passangers and had a net profit of 539.8 mln zlotys 
in 2006, according to the most recent figures posted on its website.

Ryanair, which operates 516 routes from 26 cities in 23 countries across Europe, determines charges for each 
destination based on the length of the flight.
One hour of flight time on Ryanair costs E20-E30, so a one-way ticket to Israel from Europe is expected to cost 
travelers E60 to E120, according to reports.

Financial analysts were left red-faced last year as the markets spectacularly crashed, belying their optimistic 
forecasts. They shouldn't, however, have been too surprised.
Here we go again: a new year invariably sees people gazing into their crystal balls. AIB's a buy! Sell tech! Ryanair's 
worth a punt! Get out of the US! Get into the US! Most investors love this stuff.
That's why all the usual suspects are called out to impart their words of wisdom and tell us what's in store for global 
markets over the next 12 months.
Me, I'm a touch cynical. Writing on the same subject last year, I described the prediction game as ''at best, a bit of 
harmless fun''. That was probably being generous.
Those who took the advice of the experts this time last year had little fun over the following 12 months. Global 
markets have been wobbly, but the poor old Iseq has been massacred, rocked by the ongoing sub-prime debacle in 
the US, as well as the bursting of the property bubble. Did anyone see it coming? Davy Stockbrokers didn't.
One newspaper report from this time last year quotes it as saying that it was ''highly likely'' that 2007 would be the 
fifth year in a row that the Iseq enjoyed gains in the region of 20 per cent. By early February, the firm was saying 
that it expected the Irish market to top 11,000 this year and set a price target of  27.50 for AIB and  37.50 for CRH.
Not quite. The Iseq endured a summer of slaughter. Clearly stunned at the severity of the fall, a Davy report in mid-
October emphasised that valuations were now ''discounting Armageddon''.
Within a month, however, the Iseq had plunged another 1,700 points - well over 20 per cent from 'Armageddon' 
level. It went as low as 6,281 in November and currently sits at 6,900. AIB's low was seen in the same month - 
below  13, or less than half the Davy target. It currently resides at  15.50. CRH made its target of  37.50 in the 
summer, but it has been downhill since (a low of  22 in November;  24 last week).
Crystal balls failed the tipsters
Let's not pick on Davy though. Its record is no worse than anyone else's. ''We think there's really strong momentum 
going into 2007," a senior analyst at Goodbody's said this time last year.
''With inflation steady and interest rate hikes likely to top out at around 3.75 per cent, it's a very benign scenario for 
corporate profit growth."
He went on to tip Grafton, which lost over 50 per cent this year; CPL, which started the year brightly before giving 
up its gains and more in the latter half of the year; Ryanair, which went sideways for most of the year before ending 
on a sour note; and recruitment specialist Newcourt, ''a straight play on the Irish economy'' that has lost about 35 
per cent of its value over the past year.
Sticking to last year's Christmas tips, a leading researcher for Merrion picked AIB, CRH and Ryanair - we've 
commented on their progress already. His other tips included Anglo Irish Bank, which, like the entire financial 
sector, had a horrid year, and C&C.
''C&C is looking to further expand the geographic distribution into a new market this year, as well as to begin 
servicing the UK off-trade in earnest as they grow their capacity."
That sure sounds impressive. Unfortunately, 2007 turned out to be an annus horribilis for C&C shareholders, who 
suffered a drawdown of roughly 75 per cent.
I could go on and rehash tips from other brokers, but it's just more of the same really. No one remarked on the 
dangers emanating from the sub-prime sector in the US; no one commented on the likelihood of the grossly-inflated 
property bubble bursting or its consequences for an index almost wholly made up of construction firms and financial 
institutions who had benefited enormously from the property boom; no one was sounding notes of caution or 
advising investors to diversify out of the small and volatile Irish market.
It's not my intention to pour scorn on individual brokers or analysts. It's nothing personal, which is why I chose to 
omit the names of the individuals who made the aforementioned calls. Some people like to make a stand on the 
issue of broker calls and cry into their pints when a tipped stock goes south.
I don't, because I never expect such calls to be prescient anyway. This whole tipping business is a silly lark and 
most professionals know it (or, at least, they should).
Making predictions as to where an index will be in 12 months' time is plain daft. It's guesswork disguised under 
fancy lingo. Forget all the talk of 'organic expansion', price-book ratios and complicated accounting analysis - it's 
guesswork.
Most of the time, the tipsters get away with it. After all, markets go up more than they go down, so most tips should 
work out anyway. The investor who acts on such tips and pays a packet in commission and stamp duty tends not to 
care that his chosen stock has likely underperformed the index.
He's made a few quid and feels like a bit of an expert - that'll do nicely. When markets head south, however, the 
tipsters are exposed and the beleaguered investor is cursing the experts who, for some reason, failed to divine the 
future.
In truth, stock-picking is not nearly as important as people think it is. Most stocks will follow their individual sector or 
the market as a whole. The investor who ploughs into a detailed analysis of a company's balance sheet believes 
that his hard work has been rewarded if his stock rises by, say, 20 per cent in a year.
Similarly, he thinks his broker is one smart cookie when a recommendation works out. In all likelihood, however, his 
hard work or the broker's expertise has nothing to do with it. Look more closely and one will find that the stock's 
sector likely enjoyed a similar rise.
Crystal balls failed the tipsters
There's another problem. It's not in brokers' interests to rubbish each and every company out there, even if their 
prospects look awful. The investment world is not peopled with bespectacled gentlemen poring over company 
minutiae, it's made up of salesmen on commission.
A truly honest broker/investment manager would tell his customer something like this: ''I don't know what the future 
holds; no one does. I don't know if AIB is a better buy than Bank of Ireland. I have an opinion but I could be wrong; I 
often am.
''After all, even the majority of investment managers underperform the market and they get paid a lot more money 
than I do. Over time, however, the market tends to rise, so my advice would be to put the money into an index fund 
or an ETF and forget about it. You'll save a bundle on commissions and stamp duty."
They can't say that, however. That would be a case of turkeys voting for Christmas. Even if one's broker is the 
purest soul imaginable, it's the height of naivety to think that he can divine where stocks are going to be at some 
given date in the future.
It's not that markets are perfectly efficient; they're not. I trade the markets very actively myself, so I'm hardly likely to 
think that. George Soros, one of the most successful investors ever, said that ''the idea that you can actually predict 
what's going to happen contradicts my way of looking at the market''. The very best investors share many attributes, 
but clairvoyance is not one of them.
That's why tipsters in the broker or analyst community are not the only ones destined to underperform. Academic 
research has been done into the subject of supposedly expert newsletter tips. What did they find? Most 
underperformed the market.
Research has been done into media tips. What did they find? Underperformance. Research has been done into the 
performance of stocks tipped on the front cover of magazines as opposed to the performance of stocks that 
attracted negative front page features. Findings? The whipping boys outperformed the darlings.
Research has been done (by contrarian fund manager David Dreman, one of the most successful investors of the 
last few decades) into the earnings forecasts by professional analysts - more than 100,000 over a 20-year period.
What did he find? The average forecast is miles off target, usually missing out by between 30 to 60 per cent.
It's not that all these people are dumb. They're not. The truth is that forecasting is inherently difficult. All kinds of 
imponderables can come into play, rendering our crystal-ball gazing futile. This difficulty is not just in relation to the 
stock market.
Scott Armstrong, professor of Marketing at the University of Pennsylvania, has been researching the limitations of 
our forecasting ability since the 1960s.
His findings are that 'experts' in a particular field are no better at making predictions on that subject than your 
average student.
For example, would an American invasion of Iran reduce or increase terrorism? Armstrong argues that the college 
student's answer is as likely to be correct as that from a professor of political science. It's the same in other fields - 
a certain amount of information is needed to make coherent decisions. Once that level of information is achieved, 
attaining more knowledge does not improve accuracy.
As for analyst predictions, the tipsters were doing just fine between 2003 and 2006. It wasn't skill on their part; it 
was a global bull market. The tide turned this year and results, as we saw at the beginning of this article, were very 
different.
Readers contemplating the merits of security analysts and their assortment of tips and ideas would do well to 
remember an old quote from Gerald Loeb, a legendary investor in the first half of the 20th century. ''In bull markets, 
you don't need 'em; in bear markets, you don't want 'em."

The Aer Lingus chief executive showed a deft hand as he tackled a number of thorny issues, but 2008 is likely to be 
just as challenging.
Two out of three ain't bad. For Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion, this year's twin successes of 
successfully fighting off Ryanair's takeover bid and coming out of the semi-state shadows to emerge as his own 
man, independent of government interference, were only partially offset by a disappointing performance on the 
share-price front.
While investors may reflect on a 25 per cent fall in the Aer Lingus share price so far this year (and a 40 per cent fall 
since the stock hit a record high in March), Mannion's position at the helm looks a little more comfortable than it did 
12 months ago.
This was underlined this weekend when the National Implementation Body announced progress in the talks 
between management and unions on a  10million cost-cutting plan. Delivering on further cost reductions will be vital 
for Mannion in 2008.
The airline began 2007 under fire, vehemently struggling to consign Ryanair's takeover ambitions to history by 
trying to convince the European Commission that the deal would be anti-competitive and not be in the interests of 
passengers.
Despite having shored up his position with the backing of the government's 25 per cent , the Employee Share 
Ownership Trust and assorted interests including Denis O'Brien and pilots' investment groups, Mannion could only 
breathe easily when EU transport commissioner Neelie Kroes shot down the takeover in June, kicking it into touch 
indefinitely pending a Ryanair appeal.
However, Mannion would hardly have foreseen that winning this struggle would not be the most difficult task of his 
year.
Clearing the air
Just as his belated summer holiday in 2006 was dramatically cut short when word of the Ryanair swoop reached 
him, the August bank holiday weekend was far from relaxing as he announced shock plans to close Aer Lingus's 
Shannon Heathrow route in favour of establishing a new base in Belfast.
The move to set up a new base had been well flagged, although Mannion kept observers guessing with hints that 
Birmingham or Manchester would be suitable locations for the airline's first base outside the Republic.
Setting up in Belfast made sense to Mannion as a logical extension of his plans to expand Aer Lingus's offerings on 
short-haul routes. Indeed, the primary motivation for seeking a stock market listing had been to give the airline the 
capacity to growby raising finance from outside investors and banks, without the constraints imposed by state 
ownership.
In retrospect, he may wonder how much praise he would have received had he ploughed ahead with the Belfast 
base but left the Shannon Heathrow link intact.
Instead, he walked a tightrope as politicians queued up to denounce the decision and calls grew for the government 
to use its 25 per cent stake to block the move.
The employee shareholder bloc weighed up whether it, too, should use its 12 per cent holding to oppose Mannion. 
The numbers looked precarious, as it appeared at one point that Mannion would struggle to get enough shareholder 
votes to back him.
As Ryanair turned up the heat by mischievously calling an EGM to allow shareholders vote on retaining the 
Shannon-Heathrow route, Mannion faced a referendum on his tenure - if the government failed to back him, his 
position would most likely have been untenable.
He will look back on the episode, however, for the right reasons. He faced down the government, establishing a 
precedent that they would back his decisions on the basis that he, not the transport minister, was now responsible 
for the airline's day-to-day management and that Aer Lingus's independence as a plc could not be jeopardised.
He also took a crunch decision by calling Ryanair's bluff and refusing to hold the EGM it had requested. The move, 
which caused considerable surprise, put the ball back in Ryanair's court and prevented an unseemly meeting that 
would have seen Aer Lingus's main shareholders squaring up to each other - earning it an unwanted reputation 
among fund managers. Despite expressing its extreme displeasure at the move, Ryanair eventually backed down 
and allowed Mannion to proceed unchecked.
Mannion went on to complete a hat-trick b y overcoming union resistance to the Shannon and Belfast plans and 
taking on pilots who threatened to ground flights in protest.
Many within the airline - both management and unions - concede that the events of this summer would have been 
unthinkable under state ownership, when union and political concerns tended to take precedence over 
management's wishes.
Whatever else he may achieve as Aer Lingus chief executive, Mannion has at least established a legacy of setting 
up bases outside the Republic that will operate using lower-cost structures than were ever possible at Dublin, Cork 
or Shannon.
Unions may also be left to reflect on previous opposition to cost reforms at these airports and wonder whether 
Mannion's need to take a stand at Belfast would have been so acute, and whether Aer Lingus would still employ 
their members working on short-haul services out of Shannon, if more acceptable work practices could have been 
agreed in the past.
Going into 2008,Mannion holds a trump card when choosing new short-haul routes: why send new planes into the 
less profitable bases in the Republic when a greater return can be achieved from Belfast or elsewhere? Unions will 
be conscious that their members will need all the activity Mannion can bring their way.
Clearing the air
But the year ahead will be far from plain sailing nonetheless. Mannion must cope with even more intense 
competition from Ryanair on almost all of his short-haul routes.
Michael O'Leary's airline has already demonstrated it can use its size and cost advantages to undercut Aer Lingus 
wherever it chooses, heightening the urgency for Aer Lingus to reduce its cost base even further.
The airline's transatlantic routes are also at a crossroads, as the new Open Skies regime offers the prospect of 
extra revenues but fresh competition from much larger players with deeper pockets.
Mannion must also worry about oil prices teetering near record highs and a less favourable economic climate that 
threatens to hurt passenger traffic.
The performance of the Aer Lingus share price reflects the uncertainty that clouds Aer Lingus's future, with 
shareholders who bought in at the time of the flotation or following Ryanair's takeover attempt - including Ryanair 
itself - nursing heavy losses.
News this weekend of progress in the cost-cutting talks may lift the mood of investors.
Mannion can at least console himself that he has acquitted himself in the areas over which he can exercise control. 
But there are no guarantees that next year will be any less turbulent than this one and the real tests may only be 
about to start.

Atlas hedge fund further hit by Kingspan and IL&P warnings
Atlas hedge fund further hit by Kingspan and IL&P warnings

Profit warnings issued by Kingspan and Irish Life & Permanent in December are likely to have wreaked further 
havoc on the Atlas hedge fund, which had already plunged by 70 per cent in the ten months to the end of 
November.
Shares in Kingspan, one of the key construction shares held by the fund, have fallen from  14.42 on November 30 
to  10.26 last Friday after the company said profit growth would slow in 2008 due to more challenging markets in 
Ireland, Britain and western Europe.
Shares in Irish Life & Permanent closed last Friday at  11.94 compared to  13.56 on November 30.
In a note circulated to investors in early December, Atlas fund manager Bruce Ashmore said the fund lost almost 50 
per cent of its value in November, leaving it down almost 70 per cent since February this year.
Ashmore blamed the fall on the fund's heavy concentration in Irish financial and construction shares. ''The result 
was most disappointing," he said.
''The scale of the losses resulted from continuing to take a positive view of selected Irish equities in particular and 
from leveraging up on that position."
Ashmore disclosed that his fund held shares in builders' provider Grafton, which fell by 22 per cent in November. It 
also held shares in insurance company FBD (down 18 per cent), Ryanair (down 13 per cent), Irish Life (down 13 
per cent), Bank of Ireland (down 12 per cent), Kingspan (down 11 per cent) and AIB (down 11 per cent).Overall, 
Irish-quoted stocks account for 90 per cent of his fund, he said.
With the notable exception of FBD, whose share price has risen on takeover speculation this month, the fund's key 
holdings have continued to fall in value this month. FBD's shares have bucked the trend, rising from  20.26 at the 
end of November to close last week at  25 on takeover speculation.
Atlas hedge fund further hit by Kingspan and IL&P warnings
Ashmore has also blamed the extent of the fund's fall in November on the fact that its borrowings amounted to 300 
per cent of its equity base. As the market fell, the fund's gearing - the proportion of equity it holds relative to its 
borrowings - was ''increasing beyond agreed levels, thus necessitating some stock sales''.
Ashmore remained optimistic: ''The fund continues to adopt a positive view of Irish equities. This is a contrarian 
view and, allied to the gearing, remains a view that contains a high level of risk. The fund manager believes the Irish 
market is over-sold and that valuations are not excessive."
Wealthy investors piled into the Atlas fund earlier this year on the basis of Ashmore's strong reputation managing 
other funds.

Top horses vie for share of  1.3m pot

Leopardstown will be in the spotlight this week when top horses will compete for more than  1.3 million in prize 
money over four days, starting on St Stephen's Day.
Up to 65,000 people are expected through the turnstiles for the annual Christmas festival and any talk of an 
economic slowdown will be put firmly to one side at the south Dublin venue.
Every sector of Irish industry seems to be represented as a sponsor at the meeting.
Homebuilding firm Durkan is sponsoring the opening day's Novice Chase and Grade 1 Novice Hurdle, which have a 
combined prize fund of  324,000.
In the Novice Chase, Edward O'Grady's Sky's The Limit may take on some of the leading novice chasers in the 
country, including JP McManus's Perce Rock. In the juvenile Hurdle, which carries Group 1 status for the first time, 
the entries are headed by trainer Willie Mullins's Temlett, which is considered to be a Cheltenham Triumph hurdle 
horse in the making.
Bookmaker Paddy Power will sponsor all the races on Thursday, including one of the biggest betting races of the 
week, the  190,000 Paddy Power Chase.
That race used to favour horses carrying a low weight, but Cane Brake turned that statistic on its head when 
winning off top weight last year for Tom Taaffe.
The Troytown Chase, which was run at Navan a few weeks ago, usually proves a good guide for this ultra-
competitive meeting, and Gaza's Girl and Benefit Night renew their rivalry here again. Johnjo O'Neill has declared 
JP McManus's Bob Hall, while Paul Nicholls is sending over Officier de Reserve.
Top horses vie for share of  1.3m pot
The Lexus Chase, worth  200,000, the richest race in the winter National Hunt calendar, is on day three. This year's 
contest has been given extra spice by the expected participation of rising National Hunt star Denman, which is also 
from Nicholls' yard.
The joint-favourite for next year's Cheltenham Gold Cup looks to follow up an impressive win in the Hennessy at 
Newbury on his last start. But there has been strong support for last year's Lexus winner, The Listener, winner of 
the Durkan Memorial Chase at Punchestown two weeks ago.
Michael Hourigan's evergreen chaser Beef Or Salmon will raise the roof if he can outstay these two English 
challengers. Hourigan also intends to run Mossbank, owned by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary.
The Knight Frank Ganly Waters Novice Chase over three miles on the same day could be one of the races of the 
meeting, with Sky's The Limit, Jim Comerford's Kazal, Le Toscan, Callherwhatyoulike, Notre Pe're and Conor 
Clarkson's Fingeronthepulse all entered.
On the final day, it's the turn of the two-mile hurdlers in the Bewleyshotel.com December Hurdle. Noel Meade is 
likely to run Aitmatov, the winner of the recent Hattons Grace hurdle at Fairyhouse. Pat Hughes' Farmer Brown, 
winner of the Galway Hurdle, is also entered.
A revamp of the Leopardstown racecourse is likely to be unveiled in the five-year plan of Horse Racing Ireland 
(HRI).The body had decided that work on Leopardstown would not run simultaneously with work on the  100 million 
redevelopment of the Curragh course, which is in the hands of An Bord Pleanala.
While that decision remains, there may be some movement on Leopardstown in the coming years.
This week, there is also racing at Down Royal on St Stephen's Day, while the Guinness Festival at Limerick's four-
day meeting also begins on Wednesday, Punchestown hosts a New Year's Eve card and Tramore kicks off 2008 on 
New Year's Day.
The Christmas period will be important in helping Horse Racing Ireland reach its attendance figure target of 1.5 
million people this year.
Normally, the body could look forward to achieving this with confidence, but the wet summer dampened 
attendances significantly at certain tracks.
It is ironic, then, that the past two months has seen National Hunt trainers bemoan the unseasonably fast ground 
that has kept some of their stable stars under wraps.

Body
The Dublin market entered the Christmas period on a high note today, up over 1 percent at midday. 
At 12.20pm, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 86.26 points at 6886.36
Markets saw some respite yesterday from the recent downward pressure with better-than-expected results from 
Oracle and rumours that Merrill Lynch is likely to be the latest bank to get a capital infusion from an Asian 
government fund. 
 European markets should be better today in response as the market enters the quieter holiday. Bank of Ireland 
was up 12c to 9.74 and AIB rose 16c to 15.26. Anglo Irish Bank climbed 5c to 10.75 and Irish Life and Permanent 
was up 5c to 11.65. In the construction sector, CRH climbed 8c to 23.50 and Grafton was up 10c to 5.40. 
McInerney rose 3c at 1.25 and Kingspan fell 7c to 10.10. Elsewhere, Irish pharmaceutical company Elan was up 
69c to 15.52 and no-frills airline Ryanair climbed 6c to 4.71 Other notable movers include DCC down 6c to 19.35, 
FBD down 15c to 25.15 and ICON down 10c to 42.00 Shares at Smurfit Kappa climbed 8c to 11.12 on two pieces 
of positive reports for the group. Latest data from RISI indicate that recovered paper prices in Europe declined by 
about E20/tonne over the past two months, from E97 to E77 per tonne. This is positive for Smurfit Kappa as 
recovered paper is one of the key inputs in its containerboard system, according to Barry Dixon, analyst at Davy 
Research. Meanwhile in the US, two recycled containerboard producers have announced price increases of 
USD40/tonne from January 21st 2008. This should help to support higher US kraftliner prices, which is the main 
grade imported into Europe. Overall, this is positive for SKG with input costs declining and further increases likely in 
containerboard and ultimately corrugated boxes, he said. Shares at drinks group C and C rose 9c to 4.10 despite 
drink sales in English and Welsh pubs declining 7.4pc since the introduction of the smoking ban in June, according 
to a survey conducted by the Federation of Licensed Victuallers Association. The survey was concluded on 
December 7th with 2,708 licensees responding. Also, shares at Aminex were unchanged at 0.34 on news that it 
commenced drilling for drilling gas in Texas. Aminex and its partners have started drilling their fourth development 
ISEQ enters the festive season on a high
well on the South Weslaco field in Texas. To date, more than 20 BCF of commercial gas has been discovered at 
South Weslaco. All three previous wells are in production. The new development well, GU #28, will target Frio 
sands deeper than 10,000 ft. Sands at these depths have yet to be tapped and tested by Aminex and its partners. 
Estimated drilling time is 25-30 days. Aminex has a 25pc working interest in the field. Share at media group UTV 
remained flat at 3.50 despite a report in today's Irish Times has linking with a possible bid for the E10-12m rated 
Highland Radio in Donegal. The station was recently acquired by Communicorp from Emap, alongside FM104 
(since sold to UTV) and Today FM.

Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has won its High Court battle to be allowed hanger space at Dublin Airport.
Mr Justice Gray upheld an agreement with maintenance company SR Technics Ireland Ltd, granting Ryanair Ltd a 
15 year use of hanger space at the airport.
And he ordered SRT to pay the estimated 400,000 stg legal costs of the two week court fight and refused them 
permission to appeal.
SRT, although refused permission to appeal, may go direct to the Court of Appeal in the new year in a bid to 
challenge the ruling.

Cathal Ryan, son of the late Ryanair founder Dr Tony Ryan, has died.
Mr Ryan was a pilot and a long-serving director of the airline. Dr Tony Ryan died in October after a long illness.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary paid tribute to Cathal Ryan, saying 'his vision, his expertise and his 
dedication to aircraft safety was pivotal to the development of Ryanair'.
 Meanwhile Ryanair has welcomed a ruling in the High Court in London. Mr Justice Gray gave the airline an 
injunction against aircraft maintenance company SRT to prevent it forcing Ryanair to vacate a hanger at Dublin 
Airport. The judgement was critical of SRT and the Dublin Airport Authority. Ryanair had asked the court to compel 
SRT to honour promises it says were made by the maintenance company in 2000 in side letters to contracts to seek 
a 15-year licence to use Dublin airport hangars in return for moving its maintenance operation from Stansted.

Ryanair has won its lawsuit against aircraft maintenance firm, SR Technics, over alleged breach of contract on 
hangar space.
During the trial in London, Ryanair accused both the company and the authority of colluding against it in denying it 
hangar space in favour of Aer Lingus. 
SR Technics must now use its "best endeavours" to secure long-term hangar space at Dublin Airport for the airline, 
the High Court in London ruled yesterday.
 If the DAA unreasonably withholds agreement to such a licence or tenancy it will face legal sanction in the London 
courts. In an extremely critical 40-page judgement against SR Technics and in favour of Ryanair, Mr Justice Gray 
found the company had not acted in good faith in implementing an agreement between the airline and the 
maintenance company. The ruling is a significant victory for Ryanair, which said hangar space was central to 
agreeing to move its maintenance operation from Stansted to Dublin.

Air France has become the first airline to offer international passengers e-mail and text-messaging service that's 
based on standard cell phone technology.
The catch: It's only available on a single Airbus A318 aircraft in the Air France fleet, and passengers won't know 
ahead of time whether the service will be available on their flight.
"That will be a surprise every day," Air France spokeswoman Marina Tymen said Thursday. "They will be aware of 
that just when they look at the information leaflet and the questionnaire (in the seat pocket) in front of them."
Another clue: a new "no mobile" light next to ones for "no smoking" and "fasten your seat belt."
The six-month trial, which launched Monday on a Paris-to-Warsaw flight, will initially be limited to messaging and e-
mail on passengers' cell phones with GSM technology, the kind prevalent outside the United States. Voice calling 
will come later.
The airline equipped the A318 with an onboard cell "tower," allowing phones to communicate without interfering 
with navigational equipment, officials say. The onboard tower connects with the ground through a satellite system.
The setup, approved by the European Aviation Safety Agency, was provided by OnAir, a Geneva-based joint 
venture between Airbus and SITA, an information-technology company serving airlines.
Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. already has been testing a similar service on domestic flights using technology from 
rival AeroMobile Ltd., a joint venture of ARINC Inc. and Telenor ASA.
JetBlue Airways Corp. started tests this month of limited e-mail and messaging services in the United States, using 
a wireless Wi-Fi system rather than an onboard cellular network, which is not yet approved by U.S. regulators.
Air France said it would await the results of the trial before deciding whether to equip the rest of its fleet.

Passengers will be billed directly by their cellular provider at rates officials say are comparable to international 
roaming.
OnAir plans to service European no-frills carrier Ryanair Ltd., British Midland Airways Ltd. and Portugal's TAP by 
mid-2008. Later customers include Royal Jordanian Airlines, China's Shenzhen Airlines and India's Kingfisher

At 10.55am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 24.75 points at 6807.15
Banking shares were mixed. Bank of Ireland down 8c to 9.82 and AIB rose 2c to 15.17. Anglo Irish Bank slipped 4c

Ryanair was up 5c to 4.60, FBD down 50c to 25.00 and Kerry Group up 25c to 22.75 Meanwhile, shares at Belfast-

E52m or £37.1m. To fund the deal, UTV issued 2.74m new shares at £2.00, raising £5.48m, with the balance being 
funded through debt. "This acquisition is positive for UTV. It provides the group with a much stronger total offering 
to advertisers, and over time we expect that synergies can be achieved between Q102 and FM104 in the Dublin 
area," according to Conor Duffy, analyst at Davy Research. Also, shares at Independent News and Media were up 
5c to 2.28 after it confirmed that it will enter exclusive talks to acquire The Sligo Champion. No sale price has been 
disclosed yet but it is expected to be in the region of E25m. With circulation of 12,574 and turnover of E3.8m and 
approximately E2m in profits, this is a highly profitable newspaper and would give INWS its thirteenth regional 
newspaper in Ireland. Shares at DCC rose 69c to 19.10 after it announced that following a share capital 
reorganisation by its associate Manor Park, it has received a dividend of E172m from Manor Park as franked 
investment income. Following receipt of this dividend, the value of DCC's 49pc shareholding in Manor Park is no 
longer material "This looks like a good result for DCC. It implies a full value for Manor Park of c.E440m. Putting this 
in our sum-of-the-parts valuation gives us a fair value for the overall group of 2538c, representing 38pc upside from 
last night's closing price (December 18th)," David Jennings, analyst at Davy Research said.

relief will probably result in an increased demand for homes next year, the number likely to be built up to mid year 
will be dramatically lower than in the current year. "Registrations are down, and we can say in the first six months of 
next year 20,000- 25,000 new homes will be built," head of public affairs Martin Whelan says. "What happens in the 
latter six months depends on how the market responds." Elsewhere, Irish pharmaceutical company Elan rose 6c to

Shares in Kingspan dragged the Dublin market lower today, diving by almost 21pc after it warned that present 
market conditions make it difficult to guide for the coming year.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 70.02 points at 6831.90
Kingspan plunged E2.70 to 10.65 after it released a weaker-than-expected trading statement. 
 The Cavan-based building materials group said the first 11 months of the year showed strong trading and forecast 
a 22pc hike in operating profits for the full year to E236 million. However, it said that the construction environment in 
the UK, Ireland and Western Europe is more challenging than in recent times. "We had thought that Kingspan 
would issue a cautious trading statement but it is even weaker than we expected. It contrasts with the comments 
made last September when orders and quotations were reportedly at record levels," Davy Research said. However, 
banking shares were boosted by a major injection of liquidity by the European Central Bank. The ECB awarded 
E348.6 billion of funds at today's main refinancing operation at a bid rate of 4.21pc -- E200 billion more than its 
benchmark requirement -- in a bid to bring down interbank borrowing rates. Also, Bank of England governor Mervyn 
King struck a note of optimism on the ongoing liquidity conditions facing the banking sector, saying that he sees 
some improvement by February or March. Appearing before the influential Treasury Select Committee, King said he 
sees a 'more sustainable position' emerging once banking losses have been revealed and financial institutions 
recapitalised. Still, King predicts that things may remain tough in credit markets for a while. 'A painful adjustment 
faces the global banking sector over the next few months as losses are revealed and new capital is raised to repair 
bank balance sheets,' he said. Banking shares were mixed. Bank of Ireland was up 4c to 9.99 and AIB rose 11c to 
15.24. Anglo Irish Bank slipped 1c to 10.72 and Irish Life and Permanent fell 6c to 12.07 In the construction sector,

Oil slipped 1c to 4.76 after it announced that it has agreed to acquire up to 10pc in each of blocks 35, 49 and R2 in 
Yemen from Virgin Resources, subject to necessary approvals. This is the company's first attempt at diversification 
and is a sensible move given that up to this point its valuation was entirely leveraged to its single licence in 
Turkmenistan, according to Caren Crowley, analyst at Davy Research. "Furthermore, the Yemen licences are 
exploration-focused, providing balance to Dragon's production and development activities in Turkmenistan while still 
remaining within the company's core region." Also, shares at Tony O'Reilly's Providence Resources remained flat at

Irish aircraft leasing company AWAS became the world's top aircraft leasing firm after it ordered 31 next-generation 
Boeing 737-800 planes worth USD2.3 billion.
Dublin-based AWAS now owns 315 airplanes used by 129 different airline customers.
AWAS president and chief executive Franklin Pray said, 'We are very excited to conclude this deal with Boeing. 
This is the culmination of months of hard work and is an appropriate way for AWAS to finish off what has been a 
very exciting and redefining year for the company.'
 He added that just a year ago the company could not have closed a deal of this size. 'However this deal shows just 
how far the company has grown in the last 12 months and that we have further exciting plans for the future,' he 
said. The aircraft leasing sector has surged in recent years thanks to the success of no-frills airlines such as 
Ryanair and demand from an increasingly affluent and mobile consumer. Currently, over 30pc of the global 
commercial aircraft fleet is leased, compared with just 5pc in 1990. A 'top five' leasing company, RBS Aviation, has 
recently expanded its operation in Ireland to join AWAS, CIT, AerCap and Shannon-based and Wall Street listed 
Genesis. This country is now recognised as a world centre for aircraft leasing. Along with the influx of aircraft 
leasing firms has come some of the world's top aviation financing firms with companies such as Airbus, Orix, 
GECAS (a spin-off from GPA), CIT, ILFC, RBS and Pembroke all setting up bases in Ireland.

muted with Kenmare's share finishing up 1.5pc on relatively low volumes. We believe that the launch of sales is 
good news for shareholders and should see the stock re-trace its steps to our price target of 62p per share," Caren

reports of ambitious expansion plans by Boots Ireland for its operations in the next five years. From a base of 44 
stores at present in the Republic of Ireland, Boots plans to open another six by May 2008. The company also aims 
to double its presence over the next five years, to more than 100 stores. Acquisitions would not be ruled out in this

French bank Societe Generale is to extend its offering of covered warrants on Irish stocks in the new year, despite 
a slow take-up of the Irish versions of its specialist derivative instruments that were launched in recent months, 
writes David Clerkin.
The warrants, which are similar to contracts for difference (CFDs) but are traded on the London Stock Exchange, 
allow investors to speculate on movements in the share prices of six Irish stocks - CRH, AIB, Bank of Ireland, Anglo 
Irish Bank, Ryanair and C&C - but have attracted low trading volumes since their launch.
The warrants fluctuate in value to reflect changes in the price of their underlying stock and, like CFDs, allow 
investors to make highly leveraged bets on the future direction of share prices without owning the underlying share.
But trading patterns suggest less than  1 million has been invested in the new products so far, while some of the 
warrants have yet to witness any trading. The bank, however, said it was ''very happy with the performance of Irish 
warrants''.
David Lake, Head of British-listed products for Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking, said: ''In addition 
to the volumes traded directly on the exchange, we have also undertaken significant volume directly with Irish 
brokers, banks and wealth managers in longer-dated warrants, protected notes and reverse convertibles."

An Irish investor has agreed to purchase Princeton House, an office building in High Holborn, London, for about  55 
million.
The building is let to Prudential Property Investment Managers and senior industry sources in London said the main 
attraction of the building is its future redevelopment value.
GVA Grimley, which acts for a number of Irish investors including Michael O'Leary of Ryanair, acted for the 
purchaser, according to the sources. Prudential has more than 300 employees based in the building.
Chichester House, a building next to Princeton House, was sold to Hines European Development Fund II for just 
under  40 million earlier this year.
Sources said the Irish investor may look to buy that building and then redevelop the entire block which is at present 
in office and retail use.
The building is close to the British Museum, the Royal Courts of Justice and Holborn, Tottenham Court Road and 
Chancery tube stations.
Despite the fact that commercial property prices are down around 20 per cent in large parts of London, Irish 
investors continue to purchase large investments.
Many of the leading purchasers believe that value is now re-emerging in the London market after the white-hot 
market there finally cooled down.
Private clients of Davy Stockbrokers are understood to be looking to begin purchasing more property there next 
year and other well known syndicators are also known to be looking for opportunities.

You could be forgiven for being confused about where banker Fergus Murphy is working these days given that he 
has changed jobs three times already this year.
In January, it was announced that he would be appointed chief executive officer of ACCBank, which is owned by 
Dutch bank Rabobank. At the time, it was said he would take up his new position in April this year.
Murphy joined ACCBank from Rabobank in Asia. He had previously managed Rabobank's EUR 165 million 
acquisition of ACCBank in 2002.
But he was only a few months in the job at ACCBank when it emerged he was quitting to join Shelbourne 
Developments, the Irish property company which is developing the Chicago Spire project.
Then, in another surprise development last week, after just eight weeks with the developers, it emerged that he was 
leaving Shelbourne to take up the position as chief executive of the EBS building society, which carried a 
remuneration of roughly EUR 760,000 a year.
The move has fuelled speculation that Murphy may still be interested in merging EBS and ACCBank in some shape 
or form.
During his time with Rabobank, he pioneered the idea of a merger between the EBS and ACC codenamed Project 
Nova. That project came to naught following a boardroom row at the EBS earlier this year.
Brokers keep quiet Stockbrokers are a little quieter this year about trumpeting their successes. After a bumper 2006 
where the profits of some brokerages rose by over 50 per cent, the last 12months have been a lot tougher. Stock 
market volatility is not all bad news for brokers, because they still make money trading volumes on the way down.
But the reality is that it is never as profitable an environment in which to operate. One broker said that anyone who 
is heavily dependent on their private clients business would have found the last six months in particular tough.
Comment: Restless Murphy's whistle-stop tour of finance world
The market was so volatile and the extent of the stock market falls so large, that one broker said firms will have 
cared more about keeping their reputations with their clients intact for the future than the profit they made in any 
one year.
In other words, how quickly did they warn clients to get out of stocks? How many risky plays did they encourage 
their clients to get into? ''In the scale of things this year, limiting reputational damage was really more important," 
said one broker.
There were lean pickings on the corporate finance side with a Ryanair bid and Aer Lingus defence and a few other 
deals, but nothing stellar.
Finance Magazine's annual survey of broker and analysts' performance showed it was a good year for Merrion 
Stockbrokers. Excluding bonds, Merrion emerged as number one, winning 13 categories in equities versus 11 for 
Davys.
Interestingly, as markets turned sour, Merrion was credited by a number of survey respondents with offering a more 
bearish stance in the market.
Most telling of all was the comment by fund managers that brokers generally were reluctant to make sell 
recommendations in spite of falling share prices. Merrion's John Mattimoe came out tops in four categories: 
Construction & Building Materials, Airlines, Small & Mid Caps and Paper & Packaging.
When it came to strategy, Davy's Robbie Kelleher came out on top for the fourth year in a row.

Shares on the Dublin market closed the week higher as the battle for control in Independent News and Media 
gathered momentum. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 70.50 points at 7091.68
Independent News and Media chief, Tony O'Reilly, has spent another E2 million on shares in the group, bringing 
his stake to 26.25pc
 The move comes after businessman Denis O'Brien increased his shareholding to 14.5pc recently. A regulatory 
note to the Irish Stock Exchange said that Mr O'Reilly bought a million INM shares at E2.21 per share - an identical 
transaction to one made yesterday afternoon. Mr O'Reilly has now spent a total of E4.2m for two million shares in 
his company this week bringing his total shareholding to 207.19 million shares. Shares at Independent News and

broadcaster is in exclusive talks to buy FM104 from Denis O'Brien's Communicorp with a price tag of around E50m. 
Communicorp had agreed to buy Emap's stations FM104, Highland Radio and Today FM for a total of E200 million 
but Denis O'Brien was forced by competition authorities to dispose of FM104. All three of UTV's competitors in the 
bid dropped out this week leaving the field open to the Belfast group which already has radio assets in the South. 
"With a 12.5pc share, FM104 is the largest local radio station in Dublin and would be an excellent fit for UTV, which 
already has five radio licences across Ireland including Dublin's Q102," according to Conor Duffy, analyst at Davy

The High Court has been asked to strike out a case brought by Ryanair against the Dublin Airport Authority 's 
planning permission for a second terminal at Dublin Airport.
The DAA claims Ryanair's legal challenge to the permission cannot be permitted because of a settlement reached 
between the budget airline and the Government in March 2006. 
Planning permission was granted by An Bord Pleanala for the second terminal, T2, last August, and Ryanair 
launched a High Court challenge to the validity of that decision in September.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline still expects to cut ticket prices over the winter but plans to 
increase charges for passengers checking in luggage.
He was speaking after Ryanair announced new routes from Dublin and Cork to France.
Mr O'Leary said baggage charges would go up again next year, 'probably some time in advance of the summer'. He 
added that prices would continue to rise until only about 50pc of passengers were checking in luggage.
 Passengers who pre-book baggage that they want to check in to the hold via Ryanair's web site currently pay E6 
for the first bag and E12 for each additional item. Those who do not book checked baggage online pay the full rate 
of E12 on every item. Ryanair is hoping to keep down costs by encouraging people to travel with hand luggage 
only. Mr O'Leary said the company's projection for a decline in ticket prices during the European winter months was 
unchanged from previous guidance. The three new Dublin services announced today, which start next April, are to 
Brest, Rodez and Tours. The new Cork route is to Carcassonne. This will operate three times weekly from the end 
of May until the first week in September.

There was around E3 billion wiped off the value of Irish shares today after an earnings warning from a major 
mortgage lender and uncertainty about a plan to ease tightness in the credit markets.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 279.82 points at 7021.18
The decline on the Irish stock exchange comes as investors took a closer look at the US Federal Reserve's 
agreement with the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Canada and Switzerland to combat 
what it labelled elevated pressures in the credit markets. Bank of Ireland was down 31c to 10.29 and AIB fell 52c to 
15.63. Anglo Irish Bank slipped 72c to 10.63. Irish Life and Permanent plunged E1.09 to 12.27 after it said in a 
trading update that said it expects operating earnings for 2008 could be flat or slightly ahead of the expected 2007 
outcome due to the global credit crisis. Construction sector fared little better. CRH fell 65c to 25.50 and Grafton 
slipped 31c to 5.81 McInerney fell 5c to 1.27 and Kingspan was down 40c to 14.40. Elsewhere, Irish pharmaceutical 
company Elan fell E1.38 to 15.51 after two months of strategic review, BiogenIdec has announced that it is to 
remain an independent company and that no suitable buyer has been identified. "We expect Elan shares to be 
negatively affected by this news - the stock was trading approximately just over USD22 prior to BIIB's original 
announcement in mid-October," Davy Research said. "Our view had been that any new partner would be an 
energised one and would thus have the potential to be even more supportive of Tysabri in the field. In the event, 
one silver lining is that the review has been completed fairly expeditiously, allowing operational disruption at BIIB to 
be minimised. In addition, that BIIB management will be under severe pressure to outperform may prove beneficial 
for the detailing of Tysabri "Reports now suggest that investor Carl Icahn subsequently withdrew his expression of 
interest in bidding for BIIB; it is unknown whether he still has a shareholding in the company. Pfizer and Sanofi 
Aventis had also been mooted as possible bidders." Other notable movers include IAWS down 30c to 14.70, 
Ryanair down 17c to 4.49 and Kerry Group down 38c to 21.95 Meanwhile, shares at Glanbia rose 8c to 4.58 after 
the Government is to support Glanbia's E21million Kilkenny research and development centre by E6.3million. The 
investment will further support the group's innovation programme, which is centred on its new innovation centre in 
Around E3bn wiped off value of ISEQ
Leggetsrath Business Park and is central to Glanbia's growth strategy The flagship investment will see the creation 
of 23 additional highly qualified jobs on top of the 25 already in place at the centre. This will make it the largest 
dedicated research and development centre for a dairy food company in Ireland Also, shares at Vislink were flat at 
0.77 on news that it has opened a sales and marketing office in Dubai, which is scheduled to commence trading in 
early January 2008. "An office in the important Middle East region will support Vislink's regional sales effort, where

Shares on the Dublin market closed lower today after the US Federal Reserve disappointed the markets with only a 
25 basis point cut.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 12.50 points at 7301.00
The equity market wanted more from yesterday's Fed meeting when it cut its funds and discount rates by 25 basis 
points each. "The market's disappointment lies in the fact that not only was the cut in the fed funds rate not more 
aggressive, but the discount rate was not cut by more either," according to Dermot O'Leary, analyst at Goodbody 
Research. "While the odds on the former were small, a 50bps cut in the discount rate could have been reasonably 
expected given the Fed's recent talk of a more "innovative" approach to monetary policy management." However, 
shares were given boost after European Central Bank vice-president Lucas Papademos said the joint action being 
taken by the ECB and the central banks of the US, UK, Canada and Switzerland is aimed at ensuring orderly 
functioning in the money markets. 
Speaking at a news conference, Papademos also did not rule out further joint measures could be taken if tensions 
in the money markets persist. The joint action is to 'address elevated pressures' in the term money markets, he 
said. He said the joint action is aimed at 'easing pressures and containing pressures in the term money markets'. 
The ECB earlier said it will provide US dollar funding to eurosystem counterparties through two US dollar-
denominated liquidity-providing operations. The operations will have a maturity of 28 and 35 days respectively, the 
ECB said. Papademos was asked whether there was an agreement to continue the measures after the 35-day 
period has expired, and said: 'I think all central banks aim to ensure orderly condition in the money markets and 
addressing the pressures that are persistent and the necessary measures will be taken as needed.' Meanwhile, 
financial shares were mixed. Bank of Ireland was up 10c to 10.79 and AIB rose 44c to 16.33. Anglo Irish Bank 
climbed 16c to 11.45 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 24c to 13.50 In the construction sector, CRH fell 57c

Also, shares at IFG were unchanged at 1.45 after Mattioli Woods, a peer of IFG's UK Pensioneer Trustee, released

Shares on the Dublin market closed higher today amid expectations of an interest rate cut by the US Federal

The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 129.50 points at 7370.62
Investors remained upbeat ahead of the Fed's rate-setting meeting tomorrow. The US Fed's Open Market 
Committee will cut its funds rate for a third straight meeting tomorrow. But any hopes of a 50 basis points move look 
likely to be dashed. Policymakers are broadly expected to lower rates, though economists are still split over whether 
there will be a quarter-point cut or a half-point cut. "The market still sees only a 25pc chance that it will go for that 
aggressive course of action. We think that is unlikely too and that it will bring its funds rate down to 4.25pc from 
4.5pc", according to Rossa White, analyst at Davy Research. Also, Swiss bank UBS said it will write down some 
USD10 billion of subprime mortgage holdings, which could lead to full-year losses. However, shares rallied in 
European trading as the bank unveiled plans for an USD11.5 billion cash infusion from the government of 
Singapore and an unidentified Middle Eastern investor. Meanwhile, banking shares were mixed. Bank of Ireland 
down 2c to 10.95 and AIB up 23c to 15.96. Anglo Irish Bank rose 27c to 11.51 and Irish Life and Permanent 
climbed 10c to 14.10 In the construction sector, CRH was up E1.15 to 26.80 and Grafton rose 21c to 6.23 
McInerney climbed 1c at 1.28 and Kingspan was up 15c to 14.47. Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power was up 11c 
to 23.01 and no-frills airline Ryanair was up 1c to 4.66. Other notable movers include Smurfit Kappa down 24c to 
11.82, Elan up 36c to 16.56 and DCC up 70c to 19.36. Also, shares at UTV remained flat at 3.73 after the 
Competition Authority cleared Communicorp's E200m acquisition of Emap's portfolio of Irish radio assets, subject to 
the disposal of Dublin station FM104, on Friday. Three parties, including UTV, are linked to the station, which is 
expected to command a price of E45-50 million, which represents a multiple of 10-11x projected EBITDA for the 12 
months to the end of March A successful bid by UTV would strengthen its position in the Irish local radio market. It 
currently operates stations in Limerick, Cork, Dublin and Louth/Meath Final bids are expected this week, and it is 
expected that the sale of FM104 will be cleared by February at the latest. UTV Media's Radio Ireland division 
ISEQ closes higher amid US rate decision
accounts for 18pc of group operating profits. Also, shares at Independent News and Media rose 3c to 2.15 despite 
disappointing UK circulation figures. The latest ABC figures, for the six months June to November 2007, show that 
The Independent in the UK had an average daily circulation of 240,827, a 5.14pc reduction over the same period 
last year. Circulation of other national morning quality newspapers fell by an average of 2.39pc during this period. 
The Independent on Sunday recorded a 1.13pc decline over the same period, with the average circulation of other 
national Sunday quality newspapers falling 4.52pc.

Shares on the Dublin market were trading higher at midday despite a dismal performance from the financial sector. 
At 11.20am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 82.11 points at 7323.23
Tomorrow, the US Fed's Open Market Committee will cut its funds rate for a third straight meeting. But any hopes 
of a 50 basis points move look likely to be dashed. 
 The market still sees only a 25pc chance that it will go for that aggressive course of action. We think that is unlikely 
too and that it will bring its funds rate down to 4.25pc from 4.5pc, according to Rossa White, analyst at Davy 
Research. Meanwhile, banking shares were all down. Bank of Ireland down 12c to 10.85 and AIB fell 8c to 15.65. 
Anglo Irish Bank slipped 7c to 11.17 and Irish Life and Permanent fell 5c to 13.95 In the construction sector, CRH

Ryanair asks EU to stop Air France bid for Alitalia until state aid repaid

in illegal state aid received from the French and Italian governments.

commission for its apparent failure to act on its complaint early last year about state aid it claims is being given to

in the rights issue from five Northern Rock shareholders speaking for 23 pct of the group's equity between them. 
The issue would be priced 'at or around' the prevailing share price in the market at the time.

Motor Co against selling its premium Jaguar brand to either of two interested bidders from India because of 'unique

US Retailers post mixed November sales
NEW YORK (AP) - The holiday shopping season got off to an uneasy start as consumers took advantage of big 
Thanksgiving weekend discounts and then pulled back, leaving US retailers with mixed sales results for November.
As retailers reported their sales results Thursday, warehouse club operators like Costco Wholesale Corp. and 
discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which were able to keep crowds coming with special offers, proved to be winners. 
But plenty of others, particularly mall-based apparel stores including Limited Brands Inc. and teen retailer Wet Seal 
Inc., had disappointing results.

Comment: Wishful thinking exposed as ECB toughens stance

So much for a cut in interest rates. Ireland's wishful thinking was exposed at last week's ECB meeting, when its 
president Jean-Claude Trichet took a hardline stance and reminded everyone that keeping a lid on inflation was the 
bank's number one priority.
Trichet didn't mince his words, taking the unusual step of revealing that a minority of ECB governing council 
members had voted in favour of a rate hike even though the council agreed to leave rates on hold.
The statement was bad news for those who had figured that the ECB was bound to lower rates in response to the 
emergency rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve that had been prompted by the credit crunch. On the same day 
that the Bank of England announced its first rate cut in four years, Trichet was displaying his cherished 
independence and his commitment to fighting inflation.
So where next for rates? Many economists saw Trichet's comments as a signal to prepare for a rate hike early in 
the New Year.
While it may not be as cut and dried as that. Trichet will be aware that markets remain extremely volatile and that 
the necessary repricing of risk that he has long spoken about is well underway.
Last week's stance showed the unwillingness of the ECB to take the easy option of a rate cut to appease eurozone 
politicians. For those hoping for interventions to rescue the Irish property market, Trichet's name has been taken off 
speed-dial.
Despite last week's u-turn on stamp duty by Minister for Finance Brian Cowen, Trichet has other things on his mind.
Ryanair's Italian job Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary will be watching the latest plot twists at Alitalia with interest. The 
Air France/KLM group made a pitch to take over the troubled Italian flag-carrier last week, and finds itself up against 
two competing bidders.
Comment: Wishful thinking exposed as ECB toughens stance
For O'Leary, it may be a case of ''I told you so'', after repeatedly stressing that his swoop on Aer Lingus was simply 
a forerunner to the wave of consolidation that is about to sweep through the European airline sector.
If Air France/KLM pulls off the deal, O'Leary is sure to use it as yet another battering ram to send in the direction of 
the European Commission, which has so far blocked his Aer Lingus takeover attempt. Either way, it's worth noting 
what has happened to the Aer Lingus share price in recent weeks - and it's also worth wondering what O'Leary's 
thoughts are on resurrecting his bid in the months or years ahead.
Ryanair has spoken of writing down the value of its 29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus following the fall in the share 
price to  1.90, before it recovered to  2.07 late last week.
It's certainly well below the  2.45 average price at which Ryanair assembled its stake, but even further away from 
the  2.80 with which O'Leary offered to buy out all Aer Lingus shareholders last year.
What price would he offer if the European Commission decided to remove its objections?  2.80 would seem 
generous these days.

Ryanair asks EU to stop Air France bid for Alitalia until state aid repaid
BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has called on the European 
Commission to block Air France-KLM's bid for rival Alitalia until both airlines have paid back a combined 2.7 bln eur 
in illegal state aid received from the French and Italian governments.

commission for its apparent failure to act on its complaint early last year about state aid it claims is being given to 
Air France.

Ford shouldn't sell Jaguar to Indian bidders for 'image' reasons - top US dealer
LONDON (Thomson Financial) - The head of a group that represents Jaguar car dealers in the US is warning Ford 
Motor Co against selling its premium Jaguar brand to either of two interested bidders from India because of 'unique 
image issues.'
Instead of selling to Tata Group or Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, Ford should sell Jaguar to another final bidder, JP 
Morgan Chase & Co's One Equity Partners, said Ken Gorin, chairman of the Jaguar Business Operations Council. 'I 
don't believe the US public is ready for ownership out of India' of a luxury-car brand such as Jaguar, Gorin told the 
Wall Street Journal in an interview.

takeover proposal as 'dead in the water.'

US Retailers post mixed November sales
NEW YORK (AP) - The holiday shopping season got off to an uneasy start as consumers took advantage of big 
Thanksgiving weekend discounts and then pulled back, leaving US retailers with mixed sales results for November.
As retailers reported their sales results Thursday, warehouse club operators like Costco Wholesale Corp. and 
discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which were able to keep crowds coming with special offers, proved to be winners. 
But plenty of others, particularly mall-based apparel stores including Limited Brands Inc. and teen retailer Wet Seal 
Inc., had disappointing results.

Two pioneering start-up operators of budget private jet services have completed equity funding rounds aimed at 
launching services in the next 18 months.
JetBird, an Irish company seeking to become one of the early pan-European operators of "very light private jets", 
raised Euros 21m (Pounds 15m) in equity in preparation for financing its first 25 aircraft.
A second group, Blink, founded by two former investment bankers from UBS and Goldman Sachs, raised Dollars 
30m (Pounds 14.8m) in equity from three private family funds and nonrecourse bank debt to fund its first 30 Cessna 
Mustang four-passenger jets.
JetBird, founded by Domnhal Slattery, an Irish financier, will be the launch customer in Europe for the Embraer 
Phenom 100, part of a family of very light and light jets under development by the Brazilian aircraft maker.
Several US and European start-ups want to exploit the cheaper VLJs from aircraft makers including Embraer, 
Cessna and Eclipse of the US through new business models offering so-called air taxi services.
JetBird is planning two bases at London Stansted and Cologne/Bonn airports.
It plans later bases in France, Switzerland and Italy, as it seeks to bring lessons from the operating models of low-
cost commercial airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet to private jets. JetBird plans to fly to 75 airports around 
Europe.
Mr Slattery, a former executive at Royal Bank of Scotland, said the group would offer a service comparable to 
current business class standards, costing less than half some private jet services.
The Euros 21m share placing was led by Claret Capital, a Dublin-based private equity fund founded by Mr Slattery 
in 2005.
Blink plans to start operating out of Farnborough, a leading business airport close to London, next May.
Air taxi pioneers in Pounds 30m funding
*Air Charter Service, which had been seeking to become the second listed air charter broker on the London stock 
exchange, has been forced to abandon its planned Pounds 8m initial public offering. It said the flotation was 
postponed because of the "current state of the equity markets" and its failure to achieve an "adequate" valuation.

Maxjet turbulence highlights the risks

The signs of financial distress disclosed yesterday by Maxjet, one of the pioneering new breed of business class 
only airlines, highlight the risks facing most new business models in a sector notorious for destroying capital.
The record of the airline sector of transforming large fortunes into small fortunes has seldom deterred the endless 
stream of hopefuls attracted by the industry's questionable glamour, however, and air travellers are being wooed by 
a growing array of offerings, as the sector fragments both in commercial and private aviation.
Maxjet, listed in London but a US-registered airline, is one of a group of four carriers including Eos of the US, the 
UK's Silverjet and L'Avion in Paris, launched in the past two years with all-business class services to challenge the 
legacy carriers on long-haul routes out of Europe and the US.
The low-cost business model is well-established in short-haul regional markets in North America, Europe, Asia-
Pacific and Latin America, but new operators are emerging to try their luck in the new arena for low-cost, long-haul 
flights including AirAsia X, the Malaysian start-up out of Kuala Lumpur, and the rather more modest Zoom Airlines, 
a UK/Canadian venture operating between London Gatwick and New York JFK.
Oasis Hong Kong Airlines has also just celebrated its first anniversary of low-fare operations between Hong Kong 
and London Gatwick and in the summer added a second route between Hong Kong and Vancouver.
In private aviation, for those seeking an executive jet to avoid the hassle of using the congested hub airports, new 
business models for so-called "air taxi" or "air limousine" services are being dreamed up to exploit the new 
technology available in the emerging product category of very light jets.
It is still early days, however, and problems suffered by some of the manufacturers, most notably Eclipse Aviation in 
the US, do not inspire confidence. Nonetheless optimism survives, and new operators of planned low-cost, private 
jet services such as Blink and JetBird in Europe are managing to find fresh equity backing.
Maxjet turbulence highlights the risks
For all the sparkling financial returns achieved by the highest fliers operating new business models, led by -Ryanair 
in Europe with net profit margins of close to 20 per cent, there is a host of hopefuls, however, that have nothing but 
red ink to show for their endeavours.
Maxjet started flying between London Stansted and New York JFK in November 2005. It has since opened further 
routes between Stansted and Las Vegas and Los Angeles after failing to make a service to Washington DC viable.
It raised net proceeds of Pounds 47.3m in an initial public offering in June in London. After being launched at 138p 
a share, Maxjet's share price rose briefly to a peak of 140p, but has declined steeply since October, plunging to 
only 73 1/2p before yesterday's suspension. Trading was halted "pending clarification" of its financial position.
If the airline is to secure a financial rescue package, it will have to work fast. When a carrier's financial woes 
become widely known, it has little time to secure customers' confidence. Ticket sales dry up, depriving the business 
of fresh cash, while the costs remain unchanged. At the same time critical suppliers, such as the oil companies, 
start demanding cash up front for their services and airports are often not slow to start impounding aircraft until bills 
are paid.
Maxjet insisted yesterday it was "business as usual", with both its services from London Stansted to New York and 
Los Angeles operating as normal.
Silverjet, which floated last year, has itself been forced to raise more capital in the face of higher-thanexpected 
losses. The airline says it expects to be profitable in the year to March 2009, but its share price has also suffered 
badly, falling 44 per cent from 112p in May last year.
The start-ups have been launched in an era of strongly rising demand for air travel. However, they are especially 
vulnerable to the rise in the oil price - Maxjet, Silverjet and Eos are each operating older and fuelinefficient aircraft.

European shares ended the week higher as continued optimism about the prospects for further US rate cuts 
underpinned sentiment.
US non-farm payrolls data, released yesterday, encouraged hopes of a 25 basis point cut in the Fed funds target 
rate next week.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 gained 0.8 per cent over the week to 1,538.51.
Germany's Xetra Dax index shrugged off a downgrade from Goldman Sachs to break through the key 8,000 level 
yesterday. The index has outperformed its European peers this year, rising more than 20 per cent, while the FTSE 
100 is up 5.4 per cent.
Goldman Sachs downgraded the Dax to "underweight," saying it once was one of the cheapest indices in Europe, 
but was now around average. "It is the most sensitive market to any downward revisions in GDP, and would be hit 
badly under a hard-landing scenario," Goldman said.
It was a busy week for Europe's insurers. German financial adviser AWD rocketed 28.1 per cent to Euros 29.38 
after news of a Euros 30-a-share offer from Swiss Life . But shares in Switzerland's largest life insurer dropped on 
concerns it may be overpaying for the deal, falling 2.7 per cent to SFr309.50 on the week.
Germany's Munich Re jumped yesterday after news that Cevian Capital, a Swedish activist investor, had bought a 
stake of about 3 per cent in the world's second-biggest reinsurer.
Christer Gardell, Cevian managing partner, told the Financial Times that Cevian was a "long-term" shareholder that 
wanted to "adopt an industrial approach and work with the management." Munich Re ended the week up 5.7 per 
cent at Euros 131.6.
The week's biggest winner was European broadcaster RTL , whose shares surged after German media group 
Bertelsmann said it might buy the 10.2 per cent of the company it did not already own. Shares in RTL, which has 
US jobs figures help underpin rising optimism
stakes in 39 TV channels across Europe, jumped more than 15 per cent on Wednesday and held on to the gains to 
end the week up 17.5 per cent at Euros 81.4.
Swatch also had a good week, gaining 7.5 per cent to SFr340.75. Shares in the world's largest watchmaker rose on 
Thursday after the company said November sales were the "best ever" and announced it would buy back SFr420m 
worth of stock to boost value.
At the bottom of Europe's pile, Ryanair , the Irish budget airline, revealed a Euros 90m writedown against its 29 per 
cent stake in domestic rival Aer Lingus.
The Aer Lingus shares cost Ryanair about Euros 2.50 each, but hit a year low of Euros 1.90 just over two weeks 
ago before closing yesterday at Euros 2.09. Over the week Ryanair shares fell 8.6 per cent to Euros 4.55.
StatoilHydro dropped 10.9 per cent to NKr164.80 yesterday after revising down its 2007 oil and gas production 
target. The Norwegian energy group said the impact of field repairs would also dent growth in 2008. Over the week, 
the stock was down 8.4 per cent.
Roche , the world's biggest maker of cancer medicines, dropped 5.5 per cent to SFr203.70 after failing to win US 
approval for its key breast cancer drug Avastin. Analysts quickly cut their forecasts and price targets for the 
company.

Police scuffled Friday with protesters attempting to force their way into the transport minister's office to demand that 
the government rescue debt-ridden state carrier Olympic Airlines.
Earlier this week, OA pilots declared Transport Minister Costas Hadzidakis unwelcome on their flights, saying they 
would not fly if he was a passenger.
Hadzidakis has said the airline is unlikely to survive in its current form and that a decision is expected next year, 
after meetings with EU officials about hundreds of millions of euros (dollars) of illegal state aid to the airline.
"Do you think anyone would want to shut down a company like Olympic Airlines?" he said Friday in Parliament. 
"This is a difficult situation that has lasted for years, and we are trying to find a solution ... We are not burying our 
heads in the sand."
On Thursday, the minister said the government would try to convince EU officials that OA should be preserved in its 
present form, "but I don't think that is likely."
Olympic employees are concerned about the possibility of job cuts, although Hadzidakis has pledged that none of 
the company's estimated 5,000 permanent staff will be fired. OA also hires about 3,500 contract workers.
"Privatization is the one and only way forward. We want to follow the model used by El-Al, which closed and 
opened the following day as a new company ... I don't want to hide the truth," he said. "Some employees will be 
used in the new (company). Others who want to be transferred will be transferred (to other public sector jobs) or will 
leave voluntarily."
Union representatives demanded to meet Hadzidakis on Friday, and attempted to barge into his office. Television 
footage showed them scuffling with police inside the ministry.
The European Commission has taken Greece to court twice, demanding the carrier repay the government more 
than 700 million euros ($1.02 billion) in illegal state subsidies. Athens says the sum makes it impossible to find 
investors for privatization.

According to government figures, Olympic has accumulated debts of 2.4 billion euros ($3.5 billion), costing 
taxpayers some 300,000 euros ($436,000) a day.
Hadzidakis said Friday that, if the effort to save Olympic fails, Greece would seek "to transfer activities, including 
the company's logo and name, to a new company." Any new company would serve domestic and international 
flights, but its size would depend on the outcome of talks with the European Commission, he said.
Hadzidakis met last week with EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot, following a lawsuit last month by 
Ireland's low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC against the European Commission over Olympic. The complaint, 
filed at European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, was about the failure to recover illegal state aid to 
Olympic.

The Aviation Regulator and Ryanair engaged in a battle of words today with each accusing the other of reckless 
disregard for the flying public.
Cathal Guiomard the Aviation Regulator, accused Ryanair and its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, of failing to 
comply with EU regulations in relation to passenger rights, in particular the provision of refreshments for 
passengers who are delayed.
Mr Guiomard says the head of Ryanair has adopted an aggressive stance towards the commission and has banned 
his staff from meeting with representatives of the regulatory body.
 Meanwhile, Ryanair accused Mr Guiomard of failing airline passengers, "whose interests he is supposed to 
protect" and called for his resignation. "Mr Guiomard has over the past five years presided over a doubling of his 
office costs (overstaffing, inflated wages and consultancy fees), all of which have been passed on to consumers, 
while he continues to stand idly by as the DAA monopoly hikes up terminal charges, car-parking charges, check-in 
desk charges, and most recently car hire levies at Dublin Airport," a statement from the no-frills airline said. The 
regulator said Mr O'Leary is calling for his resignation, not because the commission is doing a bad job, but because 
it has been far too effective on enforcing passenger rights.

Air Berlin hurt by problems over LTU
Air Berlin hurt by problems over LTU

Body
Air Berlin, Europe's third- largest low-cost carrier, said unexpected problems integrating German charter carrier LTU 
would lead to a "low double-digit" million euro charge nine months after the deal.
Chief financial officer Ulf Huettmeyer said "considerable technical problems" had barred Air Berlin from cutting 
capacity as planned this month and last, thus lowering earnings achieved per seat.
The statement underlined the balancing act of airline consolidation in Europe, which has seen Air Berlin scoop up 
several German rivals to become a mixed low-cost and international network carrier.
Air Berlin stock fell 5 per cent to about Euros 10 when the news was published, but it rallied to close 7 per cent 
higher at Euros 11.25, a sign of the continued belief that Air Berlin could be sold at a premium before too long.
The airline also said that charges would be offset by one-off takings and that earnings targets for this year would be 
achieved.
In August it said operating profit would exceed the Euros 64m (Dollars 79m) seen last year. The Berlin-based airline 
said it carried 2.05m passengers last month, 19 per cent more than in November 2006.
But this rise was still smaller than budgeted, the airline said, as problems with the integration of LTU blocked 
capacity cuts after the end of the summer season, usually the main season for air travel.
To counter pressure from rivals EasyJet of the UK and Ryanair from Ireland, Air Berlin this year added new routes 
to profit from summer travel.
In spite of the problem in achieving its ambitions at the latter end of this year, Air Berlin said in a statement it was 
"right on track" with capacity reduction budgeted for the coming 12 months.

Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has called on the European Commission to block Air France-KLM's bid 
for rival Alitalia until both airlines have paid back a combined 2.7 bln eur in illegal state aid received from the French 
and Italian governments.
Last month, Ryanair lodged a case at the EU's second-highest court, the Court of First Instance, against the 
commission for its apparent failure to act on its complaint early last year about state aid it claims is being given to 
Air France.
This was followed by a further case lodged by Ryanair against Alitalia last week.
No one from the commission has so far been available for comment.

Ireland on course for record year in tourism despite strength of euro

Ireland marketed as a land of "100,000 welcomes" is on course for registering its highest annual number of tourists 
in history, despite the strength of the euro currency and global economic worries, the government said Thursday.
"As we approach the end of 2007, all the indications are that we will enjoy another record year for Irish tourism," 
Tourism Minister Seamus Brennan said after the government published the latest statistics on visitors.
The report said tourists were coming in increasing numbers from the United States and continental Europe, while 
visitors from the biggest market neighboring Britain were slightly down from last year's record levels.
In all, Ireland has received 9,919,900 visitors this year through the end of October, 4.0 percent more than last year's 
record volume.
The rise in U.S. visitors was particularly prized because Americans tend to stay longer, travel more widely and 
spend more money despite the dollar's exceptional weakness versus the euro.
For the first 10 months of 2007, visitors from Britain were down 0.7 percent to 3.46 million. American travelers were 
up 0.8 percent to 952,500, an all-time high. Visitors from the rest of Europe surged 14.2 percent to 2.23 million, 
another record.
The strong growth in continental European tourism has been driven by strong competition between Ireland's two 
major airlines, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, which have dramatically expanded direct links between Ireland and 
European destinations. It also reflects wider growth in tourist traffic within the 13-nation bloc that uses the euro 
currency.
Brennan said his department planned to spend a record 50 million euros ($73 million) next year on marketing 
Ireland overseas as a tourist destination.

Greece's transport minister said Thursday it was unlikely that debt-ridden state carrier Olympic Airlines would 
continue in its present form.
Costas Hadzidakis said a final decision was expected next year after meetings between the government and EU 
officials about hundreds of millions of euros (dollars) of illegal state aid to Olympic.
The commission has taken Greece to court twice demanding the carrier return to the government more than 700 
million euros ($1.02 billion) in illegal state subsidies a sum Greece says makes it impossible to find investors for the 
hoped-for privatization of the airline.
Hadzidakis said the government would try to talk EU officials into saving the company in its present form "but I don't 
think that is likely," he said in an interview with private Alter television.
According to government figures, Olympic has accumulated debts of 2.4 billion euros ($3.5 billion), costing 
taxpayers some 300,000 euros ($436,000) a day.
Hadzidakis said that if the effort to save Olympic fails, Greece would seek "to transfer activities, including the 
company's logo and name, to a new company."
"Any solution will take place in 2008," he said.
Hadzidakis said any new company would serve domestic and international flights but its size would depend on the 
outcome of talks with the European Commission.
Earlier this week, the minister pledged that none of Olympic's estimated 8,500 workers would lose their jobs.

The two airlines in Ireland together attracted more passenger complaints last year than were given to any other EU 
nation's carriers, the European Consumer Center said Thursday.
Flying with Europe's biggest low-fare airline, Ryanair Holdings PLC, and rival Aer Lingus Group PLC led to 612 
angry passengers complaining to the European Commission's consumer outreach offices about lost or damaged 
luggage, flight cancellations, delays and other problems up 181 percent from 2005.
The ECC said the near doubling of total European complaints to 2,979 from 1,521 a year earlier showed that 
airlines are still too often ignoring passengers' rights.
But Ryanair dismissed the report saying it gets less than 10 complaints for every 1 million passengers it flies.
"The ECC received just over 400 complaints about Ryanair which equates to just 8 letters for every 1 million 
passengers carried by Ryanair. This is less than 10 complaints a week," it said in a statement.
The ECC refused to say if any other airline was the target of so many unhappy customers, saying it does not rank 
carriers and stressing that Ireland which has less than 1 percent of the EU's population had topped the list because 
it was home to the region's largest low-cost carrier and local media paid a lot of attention to passengers' rights.
It also said "a relatively high number" of Irish travel by air because the nation of 4 million is currently enjoying an 
economic boom and is an island with few sea links and no road tunnels to Britain and mainland Europe.
Airlines' claims of "extraordinary circumstances" when refusing compensation and their failure to respond to 
complaints even from the EU consumer centers created severe difficulties in resolving problems, the ECC said.
It also mentioned as "very worrying" the amount of luggage lost by airlines every year, citing figures from one 
unnamed British airline that showed 1.3 million lost bags 200,000 of them disappearing without trace.
"Assuming that each piece was approximately 15 kilogram (33 pounds), this represents 3,000 metric tons (3,307 
tons) of luggage lost by only one airline," it said.

It suggested that government agencies should have the power to sanction airlines that fail to respect passengers' 
rights, calling also for better guidelines on what a delay is and what kind of replacement items passengers should 
get when their luggage does not arrive.
They also said a consumer should get damages if an airline offers them no assistance when a flight is canceled or 
delayed.
And they also criticized airlines who made it hard for customers to reach them, saying phone numbers, e-mail and 
mailing addresses should be easily available and answered within a reasonable time limit.
Next to Ireland, Spanish and British passengers made the most complaints, the ECC said, also highlighting above 
an average number of problems cited by Swedish and German consumers.
It claimed that consumer centers were able to broker a solution with airlines on two out of five complaints.
EU officials warned in April that many people were still unaware of their rights under a 2005 law that requires 
airlines to pay up to €600 (US$873) if they are bumped off a flight, double a previous limit.
Similar compensation is required if an airline is held responsible for canceling a flight. Refunds for round-trip flights 
must be offered if the journey is no longer necessary, for example if a business meeting is missed.

The ECC refused to say if any other airline was the target of so many unhappy customers, saying it does not rank 
carriers and stressing that Ireland which has less than 1 percent of the EU's population had topped the list because 
it was home to the region's largest low-cost carrier and local media paid a lot of attention to passengers' rights.
It also said "a relatively high number" of Irish travel by air because the nation of 4 million is currently enjoying an 
economic boom and is an island with few sea links and no road tunnels to Britain and mainland Europe.
Airlines' claims of "extraordinary circumstances" when refusing compensation and their failure to respond to 
complaints even from the EU consumer centers created severe difficulties in resolving problems, the ECC said.
It also mentioned as "very worrying" the amount of luggage lost by airlines every year, citing figures from one 
unnamed British airline that showed 1.3 million lost bags 200,000 of them disappearing without trace.
"Assuming that each piece was approximately 15 kilogram (33 pounds), this represents 3,000 metric tons (3,307 
tons) of luggage lost by only one airline," it said.
Irish airlines attract most EU passenger complaints
It suggested that government agencies should have the power to sanction airlines that fail to respect passengers' 
rights, calling also for better guidelines on what a delay is and what kind of replacement items passengers should 
get when their luggage does not arrive.
They also said a consumer should get damages if an airline offers them no assistance when a flight is canceled or 
delayed.
And they also criticized airlines who made it hard for customers to reach them, saying phone numbers, e-mail and 
mailing addresses should be easily available and answered within a reasonable time limit.
Next to Ireland, Spanish and British passengers made the most complaints, the ECC said, also highlighting above 
an average number of problems cited by Swedish and German consumers.
It claimed that consumer centers were able to broker a solution with airlines on two out of five complaints.
EU officials warned in April that many people were still unaware of their rights under a 2005 law that requires 
airlines to pay up to 600 euros ($873) if they are bumped off a flight, double a previous limit.
Similar compensation is required if an airline is held responsible for canceling a flight. Refunds for round-trip flights 
must be offered if the journey is no longer necessary, for example if a business meeting is missed.

A reassuring trading update from AIB and housing market boost from Budget 2008 help boost the Dublin market 
today. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 163.61 up points 7134.30
"Brian Cowen's Budget measures yesterday struck a reasonable balance between maintaining fiscal prudence but 
at the same time not imparting any negative shocks to an economy where the growth rate is clearly already slowing 
at a rapid pace," according to Robbie Kelleher, analyst at Davy Research.
 "The most eagerly awaited measure was the change in stamp duty. He sensibly reduced the plethora of rates that 
currently exist to just two (7pc and 9pc) and introduced a properly tiered structure." Also, AIB said it expects around 
13pc growth in earnings per share for the full year 2007 despite turbulence in the global market "The overall tone of 
the statement acknowledges the current financial market turmoil, but offers some modestly positive overtures in 
relation to 2008. On the outlook, AIB is indicating that "the operating environment is becoming more challenging", 
which is no surprise. However, encouragingly, it goes on to say that "activity levels and business pipelines are good 
across all our franchises" and "we currently expect to achieve profit growth in each operating divisions and at 
overall group level" in 2008," according to Goodbody Research. In the financial sector, Bank of Ireland rose 20c to 
10.65 and AIB climbed 23c to 15.33. Anglo Irish Bank was up 21c to 10.91 and Irish Life and Permanent increased 
75c to 13.80. Construction shares were also strong. CRH was up 43c to 24.45 and Grafton remained unchanged at 
5.75. McInerney climbed 1c to 1.25 and Kingspan was up 31c to 13.95. The reform of the residential stamp duty 
rates in the Budget is welcome news for the building sector, Davy Research says. Not only does it remove 
uncertainty, but it also establishes a more equitable stamp duty regime. "The benefits may not be immediate, but a 
pick-up in activity and confidence will help the property/building sector. It now places what has been a moribund 
housing sector in a better position entering 2008," according to Flor O' Donoghue, analyst at Davy Research. "Much 
of the demand in merchanting and DIY markets is driven by housing transactions and housing RMI. Hence the

23.23 and Abbey up 16c to 5.81. Also, shares at Aer Lingus were up 1c to 2.08 after is increased its baggage 
charges on short-haul flights. A new fee of E9 per bag each way will apply on baggage booked online. This is up 
from E6. A fee of E12 per bag each way will apply to baggage that is checked in at the airport. This is a rise from 
E9. Transatlantic flight baggage charges are not affected by the latest hike. This is clearly an action to drive 
ancillary revenue and to offset the fuel price cost hit for full year 2008, according to Davy Research.

Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's biggest no-frills airline, said Wednesday it carried 23 percent more passengers last 
month compared with November 2006, but 22 percent of seats went unsold.
Ryanair said it carried 3.89 million passengers in November compared with 3.16 million a year ago, figures that 
illustrate the airline's ongoing expansion of hubs and routes across Europe.
The Dublin-based carrier said it sold 78 percent of its seats in November, a traditionally slow month, compared with 
79 percent a year ago. Those figures include customers who failed to make it to the check-in desk on time, because 
Ryanair does not refund or reschedule the tickets of travelers who miss their flights.
Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin said Ryanair's passenger-load figures were in line with investors' downbeat 
expectations.
Ryanair said it has carried 48.44 million passengers over the past 12 months, up 20 percent from a year ago. 
Passenger load over the past 12 months averaged 82 percent, a one-point decline.
Previously, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has warned that all European airlines face a potentially lean 
winter and declining passenger loads because of the global credit crunch and other economic worries that have 
depressed travelers' spending.
O'Leary says Ryanair intends to support its passenger numbers by keeping ticket prices low and seeking to claw 
back profits through Ryanair's increasing focus on charges for extras, such as baggage check-in and on-board 
shopping and bingo.
Ryanair shares were 1.6 percent higher at €4.54 (US$6.69) in midday trade on the Irish Stock Exchange.
Ryanair, founded with a single route in 1985, has opened five new bases and more than 100 new routes over the 
past year, taking the total to 23 bases and 563 routes connecting 26 countries.

Shares on the Dublin market were higher at midday as investors await Finance Minister Brian Cowen's fourth 
budget. 
At 12.05pm, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 57.34 points at 6939.82. 
"Budget 2008 is set to provide stimulus to the economy, despite grim reports. Current spending will rise 8pc and 
capital expenditure by 12.5pc well ahead of nominal GDP growth of around 5pc. That's what we know. Investors' 
focus should be on income and property tax changes," according to Rossa White, analyst at Davy Research. 
 In the financial sector, Bank of Ireland was up 15c to 10.35 and AIB rose 7c to 14.97. Anglo Irish Bank increased 
5c to 10.65 and Irish Life and Permanent climbed 26c to 13.05. CRH rose 4c to 24.14 and Grafton was up 9c to

news that it is cited as potential bidder for the Sligo Champion. Press reports this morning indicate that the vendors 
of The Sligo Champion newspaper in the north-west of Ireland have received seven bids for the for-sale title. The 
newspaper has a circulation of c.13,000 and is expected to fetch up to E20m, which represents 5x sales and 10x 
profits "Speculation as to who the likely bidders are has centred on those with an existing presence in print media in 
Ireland, as synergies can be extracted in the event that the Sligo Champion's printing presses are closed following 
the sale in favour of leasing space on a printer that produces other titles," according to Goodbody Research. 
"Independent News and Media has been cited as a potential bidder, given that it owns a portfolio of 11 local 
newspapers in Ireland, as do other potential acquirers such as Alpha Newspapers (radio and newspaper interests 
across the midlands and Northern Ireland), Celtic Media (also involved in media in the midlands and Northern 
Ireland) and Johnston Press (print media assets throughout Ireland). "The Irish Times, investment vehicles

The technology, which is being deployed in conjunction with ETNIC, the information technology agency of the 
Belgium French community, is to be employed as part of a centralised student registration system. In a classic 
middleware deployment, FUSE will be used to integrate multiple applications, servers and databases. "The 
announcement is clearly a positive for IONA, which is seeking to re-ignite top line growth, the success of which is

development on its site have been accepted (with some alterations). The plans will now be subject to public hearing 
and will be revised as necessary and should be approved within 35 weeks. "This is a positive development for 
Greencore, which has made very good headway this year on all its key development sites (Carlow, Mallow and 
Sussex). At its current share price, Greencore's properties are discounted by over 60pc in our base sum-of-the-
parts valuation, Goodbody Research said. Also, shares at Donegal Creameries were down 6c to 6.24 despite its 
planned entry into the organic market and expansion of its seed potato business, which according to Davy 
ISEQ down, banks hit hardest
Research offers "good growth potential". Donegal Creameries has commenced the conversion of a large part of its 
2,500-acre An Grianan estate to organic production. This venture marks its entry into the expanding organic dairy 
and food market. It is believed that that over time a branded organic dairy and food portfolio may be developed. 
Once the transformation of the estate to organic status is completed, An Grianan may be one of the largest if not 
the largest organic farm in Europe Finally, shares at Belfast-based high-tech digital camera technology group, 
Andor Technolgies were unchanged at 1.15 after it reported a 10.5pc rise in turnover in the full year to the end of 
September. A number of encouraging developments were revealed within the results, such as the success the firm 
has met with to date, in reducing its reliance on a small number of key economies (sales in Europe were 31pc 
higher year-on-year, while in Asia-Pacific the increase was 47pc, with the latter helped by the opening of two new 
sales offices). "This is important for Andor, given that the weak dollar and yen impacted negatively on earnings in 
full year for 2007," according to Philip O' Sulliva, analyst at Goodbody Research.

Irish specialist lender, Fresh Mortgages, has launched a legal action against Credit Suisse over a dispute that has 
resulted in Fresh suspending new loan business.
Fresh is headed by David Ryan, the former boss of Spirit Telecom. It is backed by businessmen including Sean 
FitzPatrick, chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, financier Paul Connolly, James Osborne, a director of Ryanair, and Lar 
Bradshaw, chairman of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.
Fresh issued the High Court action against Credit Suisse in the past few days, and the matter is due to come before 
the commercial division of the High Court today.
 Fresh is suing the bank for breach of contract and is seeking significant damages. The dispute arose after Fresh, 
which provides loans to people whose profile does not conform to the credit criteria of mainstream lenders, 
encountered funding difficulties when the sides could not agree on suitable financing terms. Credit Suisse had 
agreed to provide up to E1 billion to Fresh by buying parcels of mortgages written by the firm. The deal was 
reported to have come unstuck in the wake of the credit crunch.

Greek minister warns of dim future For Olympic Airlines

Greece's transport minister has warned that national carrier Olympic Airlines faces a dim future amid mounting 
speculation that it will be closed down within a few months.
In a series of carefully worded statements late Friday and over the weekend, Costis Hadzidakis reaffirmed the 
government's commitment to keep the airline aloft.
But he also stressed that the government would protect the interests of Olympic employees and the Greek public if 
the carrier is shut down something the Greek media has widely interpreted as a sign of its imminent closure.
Hadzidakis' statement came after a Friday meeting in Brussels with EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot 
and following a recent legal complaint by Ireland's low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC against the European 
Commission concerning Olympic.
The complaint, filed late last month, charges that the commission has failed to recover hundreds of millions of euros 
worth of illegal state-aid to Olympic.
"After the lawsuit by Ryanair against the commission, the situation for Olympic has become even more difficult," 
Hadzidakis said.
The commission has taken Greece to court twice demanding the return of more than €700 million in illegal state 
subsidies to the carrier a sum that Greece says makes it impossible to find investors for the hoped-for privatization 
of the airline.
Late last year, a Greek court awarded Olympic €563.9 million in compensation from the Greek state for violating an 
existing contract relating to its facilities at Athens' old international airport.
Since being appointed Transport Minister in September, Hadzidakis has been trying to negotiate with the EU to see 
if the Greek court award could potentially offset a large part of the commission's demands.
In his statement Saturday, Hadzidakis said that none of the estimated 8,500 workers at Olympic will lose their jobs 
and that none of the Greek islands would lose their air links to the mainland.
Greek minister warns of dim future For Olympic Airlines
He also pledged that the government would ensure that Olympic is not replaced by another monopoly carrier on 
domestic routes. Recently-listed Aegean Airlines is widely seen as benefiting from a potential closure of Olympic.
Since first taking office in March 2004, the center-right New Democracy government has been critical of past 
mismanagement at Olympic, highlighting that the carrier costs Greek taxpayers some €300,000 ($442US,830) a 
day.

Body
Ryanair and iTunes are the most popular sites used by over 16,000 Irish women, who shop online with 3V 
Vouchers, according to 3V Transactions Services, the online voucher payment company.
3V Vouchers are an online payment method, which allow customers access to online shopping via prepaid 
vouchers that have a disposable 16-digit VISA number. 
While two online supermarkets, Tesco and Asda, and one fashion retailer, Next, make it into the Top Ten in a 
survey of UK shoppers, no mainstream retailers feature in the top sites selected by Irish women, it found.
 Irish women are more interested in music and travel, with Ryanair and Amazon competing for the top slot among 
women of various ages, it said. The top five sites of choice among Irish women are Asos.com (43pc), Freemans 
(24pc) Next (15pc), Abercrombie (13pc) American Eagle (5pc) The highest spenders are 21 to 25 year olds who 
demonstrate average transaction values of between E40 and E50 every month, while the peak shopping periods for 
Irish women are pre and post Christmas with November and January showing spikes of 25pc and 11pc. "It is 
interesting to note the difference between our Irish and UK customers - Irish women seem to prefer the bustle of 
shopping on the High St. while their UK counterparts seem more inclined to opt for virtual shopping. The online 
shopping industry is also more mature in the UK and giving consumers better choices on line, this is reflected in our 
findings. However, anecdotally we know that many Irish consumers are using the internet for price comparisons and 
depending on the price differential decide whether to shop online or to purchase on the High Street," according to 
Federica Bonato, head of marketing, 3V Transactions Ltd., UK and Ireland.

the drug are forecast to rise to almost 40,000 by end-2008 and 51,000 by end-2009. This translates into end-user 
revenues of USD840m and USD1,283m respectively. This trajectory would leave us significantly below ELN/BIIB 
management's target to reach 100,000 patients by the end of 2010. In cashflow terms, our forecasts anticipate that 
Elan will reach EBITDA-positive territory in Q2 2008 and generate positive free cashflow in FY2009. Net debt is

Fresh Mortgages, a new lender backed by several high-profile businessmen, has launched a legal action against 
Credit Suisse over a dispute that has resulted in Fresh suspending new loan business.
Fresh is headed by David Ryan, the former boss of Spirit Telecom. It is backed by businessmen including Sean 
FitzPatrick, chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, financier Paul Connolly, James Osborne, a director of Ryanair, and Lar 
Bradshaw, chairman of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.
Fresh issued the High Court action against Credit Suisse in the past few days, and the matter is due to come before 
the commercial division of the High Court tomorrow morning.
Fresh is suing the bank for breach of contract and is seeking significant damages.
The dispute arose after Fresh, which provides loans to people whose profile does not conform to the credit criteria 
of mainstream lenders, encountered funding difficulties when the sides could not agree on suitable financing terms.
Credit Suisse had agreed to provide up to  1 billion to Fresh by buying parcels of mortgages written by the firm.
The deal was reported to have come unstuck in the wake of the credit crunch. This radically changed the 
environment governing interbank funding and resulted in many banks refusing to lend to others, or increasing the 
interest rates they charged on interbank loans.
A number of lenders that relied on interbank funding have suffered from the crunch, as they have struggled to get 
access to the money they need to fund their loan books.

 Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has commenced legal proceedings against the European Commission for failing to 
act on what the carrier alleges was illegal state aid to Air France and Lufthansa. 
The carrier has lodged two separate complaints with the European Union's Court of First Instance, alleging that 
exclusive use of terminal 2 at Munich Airport by Lufthansa and the Star Alliance, as well as discounted domestic 
airport fees in France, almost exclusively benefits Air France. 
Ryanair recently filed a complaint against France with the European Court of Human Rights in an effort to appeal 
French court decisions imposing the implementation of French labour law on Ryanair personnel working in the 
country. The European Commission has officially removed Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and Surinamese 
carrier Blue Wing Airlines from the black list of unsafe carriers, noting that the two carriers have successfully 
completed the implementation of a corrective action plan that was ordered after their inclusion on the list earlier this 
year. 
The EC has established a list of carriers considered to be unsafe and therefore not permitted to fly passengers or 
cargo in the European Union or operate within European airspace. 
Regulation 2111/2005 EC, which entered into force in January 2006, allows the EC to ban or restrict the activities of

Highlight: Airfinance Journal presents an overview of 2007 from the perspective of the banks, airlines and lessors. 
Despite the credit crunch, the growth of European airlines shows no signs of slowing down. Siqalane Taho and 
Janet Du Chenne report.
Body
It is tempting to draw comparisons. When the Japanese housing loan debt crisis hit in the early 1990s it sent shock 
waves through the international markets. Borrowers in the aviation sector suddenly found that the market they had 
come to rely on for cheap, lowly priced debt had suddenly turned and lenders were putting a squeeze on margins. 
What many thought was a mere blip turned out to be a long upward shift in pricing and market fortunes that would 
only turn in 2003. The recent US sub-prime mortgage lending crisis is slowly beginning to make its impact on the 
market. 
The International Air Transport Association has slashed nearly $2 billion, or 19%, off its 2008 profit estimates for the 
global airline sector. 
It fears that the credit crunch will hit airline balance sheets and slow the industry's long-term recovery. 
Though 2007 has shown signs of global economic uncertainty, two of Europe's biggest low-cost airlines are not 
letting up. 
Ryanair remains robust 
Shock, fear and panic. These are the words that most of the world would have expected to hear from some of 
Europe's leading airlines after the recent global credit crunch. 
As billions were wiped off company profits worldwide, aviation industry experts were expecting the airline sector to 
feel the effects of the crunch. 
The airline sector is naturally susceptible to external shocks, whether it is downturns in economic conditions, natural 
disasters, terrorism or volatile oil prices. 
Surprisingly, top airline bosses are optimistic that they are safe from the effects of the crisis. 
Avoiding the crunch
"We don't see the credit crunch having any effect on our business and it is unlikely to do so in future," says Howard 
Millar, chief financial officer of Ryanair. 
The airline continued to soar in 2007, maintaining its position as the world's most profitable carrier. 
Its net profit increased by 24% for the first half of the year to November to a record profit of (EURO)408 million 
($596 million). 
Ryanair sent a cold chill through the European airline market in March and April when it aggressively priced down 
fares. This was continued by a strong summer, which saw demand increase and capacity follow suit as British 
Airways and Iberia cut back on short-haul capacity. Consumers reacted positively to lower average fare prices with 
passenger numbers increasing by as much as 20%. 
"We have had a very good year from an operational and financing perspective," says Millar. 
The Irish low-cost carrier financed 30 aircraft in 2007, with a combined cost of between $700 million to $900 million. 
It continued to favour lowly priced financing structures such as Ex-Im-backed financing, Japanese operating lease 
with call options and straight operating leases. 
"We have been using the same financing structures for the past eight or nine years and we haven't found any 
difficulties with sourcing financing," says Millar. He adds that the carrier will continue to use the same structures in 
future and generally will work with similarly well-established banks and financiers. 
"We expect that the credit crunch will affect weaker credit airlines," he says, adding, "with stronger credits getting on 
with business as usual." 
What sets the likes of Ryanair and easyJet apart from most airlines is their financial position. They have low 
financial leverage, strong balance sheets and they are most importantly in net cash positions. 
Bankers like the fact that they have a good, resilient business model, proven profitability and the ability to grow and 
make money over the next five to 10 years. 
"The main concerns for most of the market are the credit crunch, weakening demand for travel, fears over the state 
of the US economy and a general global economic weakening," says Stephen Furlong, airline analyst at Davy 
Stockbrokers. 
He says Ryanair seems to have covered most of the bases because it continues to increase passenger numbers 
and has lowered its fares. Another positive is that it has a $65 hedge of oil prices, meaning that it is able to make 
money as oil prices shoot up. 
The airline also has no exported dollar revenues, though 60% of its costs are in dollars and, because the dollar 
weakened earlier in the year, it was able to lock down 12-month dollar hedges. 
"The credit crunch has mostly affected second- and third-tier airlines like SkyEurope, Veling and Alitalia, who are 
highly leveraged and whom financiers are putting under pressure with tighter margins," says Joe Gill, airline analyst 
at Goodbody, the stockbrokers. 
Some bankers seem to be adopting a deeply conservative attitude and are shying away from risky financing. 
Ryanair has yet again managed to keep its business growing through difficult trading conditions. It is on track to 
achieve record profitability in the current financial year. 
Gert Zonneveld, airline analyst at Panmure Gordon, says that increased growth opportunities should allow the 
airline to achieve double-digit growth in the coming years. 
Avoiding the crunch
Together with easyJet, Ryanair has a 17% total market share in Europe from both domestic and international. This 
has increased sharply as the airline has increased capacity into more European nations and lowered fares. 
EasyJet at ease 
EasyJet continued to experience a bumper year in 2007. The company achieved record profits as it increased pre-
tax profits by 48%, to £191.3 million. Passenger numbers grew by 13%, to 37.2 million for the year. 
The airline continued its expansion into various markets in Europe with eight new destinations and 46 routes added 
to the market. The airline says it aims to grow capacity by an annual rate of 15%. 
It hopes to take advantage of these opportunities as more countries join the European Union and routes open up 
across the continent. 
Unsurprisingly, high oil prices and the doubling of air passenger duty in the UK on departing passengers proved to 
be the main lows for the airline. 
EasyJet has not fallen short of buying more aircraft - it had 20 A319s delivered in the year and increased capacity 
by 14%. 
The new acquisitions were financed through a combination of mortgage debt, outright cash sales and operating 
leases. This means that 55% of the airline's fleet is on operating lease and the remaining 45% is either owned 
outright or on finance lease. 
What analysts and investors like about easyJet is its strong balance sheet and good financials. 
"The likes of easyJet and Ryanair have strong balance sheet, low leverage and are in strong cash positions," says 
Furlong at Davy Stockbrokers. 
During 2007 the airline lowered its debt-to-equity ratio by 11% and increased its cash position by 6%, or £52 million 
($105.5 million), to £913 million ($1.5 billion). 
EasyJet also took advantage of changing market conditions. The airline increased capacity and exploited growing 
demand as some carriers reduced their short-haul capacity. 
"From a financing point of view, easyJet and Ryanair should be unaffected because they have lots of cash in the 
bank," says Gill at Goodbody. 
He adds that the difficulty in accessing funds should lie with carriers who have already stretched balance sheets. 
"Operating lease rates are also at a five-year high. The main question now is whether lease rates will rise any 
further, because that will put more airlines under pressure," says Gill.

 Sri Lankan Airlines has closed a sale/leaseback deal for three A340-300 aircraft. Veling arranged the deal, while 
Alliance & Leicester underwrote the debt and HSH Nordbank took a 50% participation. 
Law firm DLA Piper acted for the banks, Veling and the investors. R-Jet, a subsidiary of Republic Airways in the US, 
has closed a mortgage loan to finance one Embraer 175 aircraft. Bank of Scotland and Alliance & Leicester 
financed the deal. 
Vedder Price is Alliance & Leicester's counsel. Air Canada has closed a $575 million predelivery payment financing 
for 10 777 aircraft, which will be delivered between November 2007 and November 2008. Calyon, NordLB and 
LBBW are joint underwriters. Calyon is facility agent. The deal comes after the appointment of Michael Rousseau 
as chief financial officer. 
Rousseau, who replaces Joshua Koshy, joins the carrier from Hudson's Bay Company. Piaggio Aero, an Italian 
aerospace manufacturer, has signed a (EURO)200 million ($292.6 million) term and revolving credit facility. Calyon, 
Intesa Sanpaolo and Unicredit are mandated lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. Unicredit is the facility agent 
and Calyon is the documentation agent. 
The facility will be used to refinance all existing short-term debt and to fund a capital expenditure programme to 
increase production. n Calyon has closed the Japanese operating lease (JOL) financing of one 777-300ER, leased 
to Cathay Pacific. Calyon is overall arranger and Mizuho is loan mandated lead arranger. ICBC is loan senior lead 
arranger. 
The deal comes after a previous JOL for one A330-300 in August 2007. Calyon was overall arranger. Ryanair has 
mandated BNP Paribas, Calyon and ING to underwrite and arrange the debt portion of a Japanese operating lease 
with call option (Jolco) for six 737-800 aircraft. Underwriting is shared equally among the three banks.  SMBC and 
BTM have joined the debt. JetBird, the Pan-European, low-cost executive jet taxi operator, has completed a private 
placement that values it at about (EURO)101 million ($150 million). 
The carrier has completed a private placement of (EURO)21 million of equity capital with European, US, private and 
institutional investors. The placement was oversubscribed and includes a combination of new and existing investors 
in JetBird. 
Deal news in brief
Proceeds from the private placement will be used to finance the first 25 Phenom 100 aircraft and general corporate 
purposes as JetBird moves closer to launching Europe's first low-cost executive jet taxi operator in 2009. Claret 
Capital underwrote, arranged and completed the fundraising.  
Domhnal Slattery, chairman of JetBird, says: "This capital-raising represents a significant uplift in valuation since 
JetBird's launch. This, in part, reflects the increased value of our order of 100 Phenom 100 aircraft following a 
number of recent price increases. JetBird is now adequately capitalized to sustain its medium-term objectives." 
Stefan Vilner, its chief executive officer, adds: "We are applying best practice, low-cost carrier principles to our 
business to bring Europe's first true low-cost, executive jet business to market. 
"We look forward to putting in place financing for our first 25 aircraft later in 2007 and are on track to launch our 
service, on schedule, in 2009."  
Dubai Aerospace Enterprise has mandated the financing of eight A330s to be leased to Emirates Airline between 
December 2007 and January 2008. The deal is worth $445 million. Calyon is global coordinator, senior loan agent 
and security agent. Calyon and BNP Paribas are joint mandated lead arrangers of the senior loan. National Bank of 
Dubai is sole mandated lead arranger of the junior loan. Bayern Landesbank, KfW, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, 
Nord LB and Deka Bank have joined the senior loan. 
Airbus has transferred four senior loans on A318 aircraft for Frontier to Q Aviation. The manufacturer also sold an 
A330, on lease to Aer Lingus, to Aircastle. 
AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, plans to sell off American Eagle, its regional carrier. 
American Eagle operates about 1,700 daily flights to more than 150 cities throughout the US, Canada, the 
Bahamas, Mexico and the Caribbean on behalf of American Airlines. 
AMR has been engaged in a strategic value review process and believes the sale of American Eagle is in the best 
interests of AMR and its shareholders. The divestiture will enable American to focus on its mainline business. 
It is expected that American Eagle will generate annual revenues of about $2.3 billion in 2007. 
Thai Airways has mandated HSH Nordbank to provide financing for two new 777-200ER aircraft in a finance lease 
structure. 
HSH Nordbank is also arranging and underwriting the $232 million deal - the bank's first mandate from the flag 
carrier. The aircraft were delivered in September and October 2007. 
John Francis, head of aviation finance (Asia), says: "We recently funded into an operating lease facility for Thai, 
and this debt facility further builds on our reliable partnership with the airline."

Body
Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus has filed a claim in the European Union Court of First Instance effectively to appeal a 
European Commission decision that the merger regulation does not give the EC the legal authority to force the sale 
of Ryanair's holding in Aer Lingus. This comes after the EC's blocking of Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus, because 
Ryanair holds only a minority share and does not have effective control. 
If successful, the appeal should enable the EC to order Ryanair to dispose of its holding in Aer Lingus, its primary 
competitor.  
The appeal rests on the court interpretation of the merger regulation. The main legislative texts for merger decisions 
in this context are the EC merger regulation and the implementing regulation. The merger regulation contains the 
main rules for the assessment of concentrations, whereas the implementing regulation concerns procedural issues 
(notification, deadlines, right to be heard). 
Aer Lingus has also asked the court, as a matter of urgency, to issue an order to prevent Ryanair from interfering in 
the management of Aer Lingus' business pending judgment on the appeal.

Ryanair sues EU, alleges failure to investigate Italian state aid to Alitalia

Ryanair Holdings PLC filed its fifth lawsuit Friday against the European Commission, this time alleging that the 
European Union's executive arm has failed to investigate state aid to struggling Italian airline Alitalia.
Ryanair, the No. 1 no-frills airline and a frequent critic of EU regulators, filed all five lawsuits this month at the 
European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Its previous suits allege an EU refusal to investigate Ryanair 
complaints about government subsidies that benefit Air France, Germany's Lufthansa, Greece's Olympic Airlines 
and Alitalia subsidiary Volare.
The Ryanair legal barrage appears inspired, in part, by a desire for retaliation against EU authorities, who have 
taken up other airlines' complaints alleging unfair business practices by Ryanair.
EU competition authorities are probing several of Ryanair's deals with small regional airports from Finland to 
Sardinia. Their latest case, announced Wednesday, challenges Ryanair's contract for operating flights to Pau, 
southwest France. In most cases, Ryanair is accused of benefiting from contracts subsidized by local governments 
or chambers of commerce seeking to put their far-flung regions on the tourist and business map.
In June, EU competition chiefs also rejected Ryanair's plans for acquiring Irish rival Aer Lingus, their first such 
refusal following approvals of four other airline mergers.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary accused the Italian government of giving Alitalia €1.7 billion (US$2.5 
billion) in illegal benefits. He said Ryanair complained about the practice in 2005 but nothing had happened.
"The ongoing state aid to Alitalia is a perfect example of the (European) Commission's bias towards inefficient 
national airlines," O'Leary said.
He said Alitalia was losing more than €400 million (US$590 million) annually "and the Italian government continues 
to illegally bail it out."
Ryanair sues EU, alleges failure to investigate Italian state aid to Alitalia
"We are calling on the commission to end its discriminatory and biased approach to state aid enforcement, to start 
promoting competition and consumer choice, and to put an end to this scandal of unlawful state aid to flag carrier 
airlines," he said.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has lodged a further case in the European Court of First Instance against the 
European Commission for failing to act on its complaint about illegal State aid to Italian airline Alitalia-Linee Aeree 
Italiane Spa.
Ryanair claims the aid consisted of several measures, including a split-up of the company's assets and operations 
and uneven allocation of the debt, resulting in a 1.7 bln eur debt write-off for Alitalia.
The Dublin-based airline initially called on the Commission to investigate this incident two years ago.
This is the fifth case Ryanair has lodged against the European Commission in the European Court of First Instance. 
The others involve complaints about alleged state aid being granted to Air France-KLM, Deusche Lufthansa AG, 
Olympic Airways and Alitalia's subsidiary, Volare.

Body
Shares on the Dublin market closed higher despite profit taking by investors on massive gains made by the banks 
on the exchange during the last few days. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 45.66 at 6958.50
Anglo Irish Bank's results yesterday were very strong, but it was the message delivered at the presentation that had 
the real impact and helped drive the share price up over 10 percent, according to Scott Rankin, analyst at Davy 
Research.
 Anglo's performance gave a much-needed boost to the other banks, which are up between 10pc and 19pc from 
their lows. "With US banks putting in a very strong performance overnight, perhaps we will get the year end "relief 
rally" we had been hoping for after all," he said. Also, shares at no-frills airline Ryanair and Tullow Oil were affected 
as oil prices rebounded after an explosion and fire on a crude oil pipeline from Canada to the US sparked supply 
concerns. US crude rose up a massive USD3.45 at USD94.07 a barrel. Brent North Sea crude surged USD2.14 to 
USD91.95. Oil had fallen yesterday on expectations OPEC will decide to raise production at its meeting next 
Wednesday and as a US weekly fuel inventory report showed crude stocks fell by less than expected. Ryanair 
closed down 12c to 4.59 and Tullow down 21c to 8.73 In the financial sector, Bank of Ireland was down 10c to 
10.53 and AIB dropped 17c to 14.58. Anglo Irish Bank fell 9c to 10.93 and Irish Life and Permanent rose E2.02 to 
14.42 CRH was up 49c to 24.85 and Kingspan fell 6c to 13.59. McInerney dropped 1c to 1.15 and Grafton 
increased 30c to 6.21. Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power rose 52c to 22.47 and Irish pharmaceutical firm Elan 
slipped 18c to 15.07. Other notable movers include Smurfit Kappa up 48c to 11.76, FBD up 85c to 19.60 and Icon 
up 61c to 40.34 Shares at C and C group were down 24c to 3.71 after Mitchells and Butlers, a UK pub operator, 
released its preliminary results for the year ended 29 September 2007. Revenue for the group rose 10.1pc to 
£1,894 million with EBITDA (pre-exceptionals) rising 9.8pc to £472m. Of importance to C and C is the company's 
commentary about the smoking ban in the UK. It said outlook for consumer spending remains uncertain and the first 
ISEQ closes higher on profit taking
winter of the English smoking ban will be challenging. The company reported that, "Trends following the smoking 
ban in England are currently broadly in line with those seen in the first year of the ban in Scotland where there was 
a slowing of overall sales in the winter months." However, it's not all bad news for C and C, operating profits at soft 
drinks firm, Britvic, climbed by 8.5pc to £80 million the year ending September 30/ The profit figure compares to £73 
million in the previous year as revenues were helped by the five-week contribution of C and C's soft drinks division, 
which included Ballygowan Mineral Water, Cidona, and the Pepsi franchise in Ireland. Brtivic's revenues grew by 
5.7pc to £716.3 million for the year, according to preliminary results released on Thursday. Britvic now lays claim to 
be Ireland's largest soft drinks firm with a market share of 33.1pc.

European stocks traded on U.S. exchanges moved up Wednesday afternoon, with most securities making gains as 
investors hoped for a cut in a key U.S. interest rate.
Comments from the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve led investors to believe that the bank might lower 
interest rates at its meeting on Dec. 11. The Bank of New York's European, Latin American and Asian American 
Depositary Receipt indexes all made large gains, as did the Nasdaq composite index, Standard and Poor's 500 and 
the Dow Jones industrial average.
The European ADR index advanced 5.19 points, or 2.8 percent, to 193.46. All but a handful of stocks moved higher.
The prospect of intervention by the Fed was particularly helpful for banking stocks, and shares of UBS AG of 
Germany also got a lift from an analyst upgrade.
Daniel Davies of Credit Suisse raised his rating to "Outperform" from "Neutral" and said UBS has little exposure to 
investments backed by subprime mortgages. He added that UBS may not need to write down large amounts of debt 
in the future, unlike other banks that have been forced to enlarge their writedowns.
The stock added $3.01, or 6.5 percent, to $49.67.
Shares of rival British miners Rio Tinto PLC and BHP Billiton PLC both rose as BHP Billiton said it will continue its 
efforts to buy Rio Tinto.
Rio Tinto shares picked up $21.95, or 5.1 percent, to $448.70, and BHP Billiton's stock rose $2.38, or 3.3 percent, 
to $74.91.
Mechel OAO, a Russian mining and steel company, advanced $5.49, or 7.1 percent, to $82.58.
A day after Signet Group PLC warned that its fiscal fourth-quarter profit will likely miss analyst estimates, the stock 
rebounded to gain $1.44, or 11.6 percent, to $13.84. Signet, which owns Kay Jewelers, sank 22.3 percent Tuesday.
European ADRs gain across most sectors; banks, mining companies advance
Shares of airlines Air France KLM and Ryanair Holdings PLC shrugged off downgrades from Deutsche Securities. 
Ireland's Ryanair rose 63 cents to $40.03, and Air France shares edged up 68 cents, to $37.03.
Among the few downers, French software company Business Objects SA which has been trading at seven-year 
highs since SAP AG said it would buy Business Objects last week gave up 8 cents to $61.37.

The European Commission said it has opened a formal investigation into contracts concluded by the Pau-Bearn 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCIPB) with Ryanair and its subsidiary Airport Marketing Services Ltd.
The commission's investigation follows a notification by French authorities and relates to two different contracts. It 
said the two contracts appear to function as one agreement and the financing may constitute startup aid for the low-
cost airline.
In addition, the EU executive has concerns about whether the financing is in line with its rules on startup aids.
The first contract concerns the conditions for using the airport infrastructure at the airport of Pau, in the Pyrenees, 
France.
The second contract, concluded with Ryanair's subsidiary Airport Marketing Services Ltd, covers the conditions for

European ADRs rise, with bank stocks up on Barclays forecast; outlook sinks Signet

An index tracking European stocks traded on U.S. exchanges edged up Tuesday afternoon, with Barclays Group 
PLC leading a rally in banking stocks on the strength of an optimistic full-year forecast.
The Bank of New York Europe ADR Index rose 2.49 to 188.27 in afternoon trading. ADRs, or American Depositary 
Receipts, are securities that allow U.S. investors to trade stocks based overseas.
Barclays said Tuesday it expects its 2007 results to be in line with analyst estimates in spite of the $2.7 billion it is 
writing down for losses on securities linked to the U.S. subprime mortgage market.
The stock rose $3.49, or 8.6 percent, to $43.87, but JPMorgan analyst Carla da Silva said the news may not be as 
good as it sounds. She said estimates of the British bank's profit have decreased sharply in the last few weeks, and 
its forecast excluded several charges.
Banks also got a boost when the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority said it would invest $7.5 billion in Citigroup Inc.
Shares of UBS AG of Germany advanced $2.38, or 5.4 percent, to $46.66.
Credit Suisse Group gained $2.01, or 3.6 percent, to $57.94.
Deutsche Bank AG added $4.45, or 3.7 percent, to $126.25.
On the losing side, U.K. jewelry retailer Signet Group PLC fell to a four-year low after the company said it will 
probably not reach analyst estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter, as sales in the U.S. and U.K. are getting weaker.
Signet said it expects to raise its sales prices after Valentine's Day to make up for increases in the price of gold, 
silver and platinum in the last few years. It said Christmas will be challenging.
The stock dropped $3.55, or 22.3 percent, to $12.40 and set a low of $11.60. That was its lowest price since April 
2003.
European ADRs rise, with bank stocks up on Barclays forecast; outlook sinks Signet
Shares of Irish airline Ryanair Holdings PLC slipped 15 cents to $39.40.
The prices of gold and silver declined Tuesday, and mining stocks fell as a result. Shares of Anglo American PLC 
gave up 18 cents to $29.27.
Britain's Randgold Resources Ltd. fell 51 cents to $36.31.
The Bank's Asian and Latin American ADR indexes also moved higher, following the Standard and Poor's 500, Dow 
Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index in the U.S.

European equities followed Wall Street south yesterday, led by troubled financial stocks as renewed credit worries 
sapped investor confidence.
French bank Natixis
fell 4.8 per cent to Euros 12.97 after revealing a Euros 407m creditrelated hit to its third-quarter results.
"There are some signs that management is willing to exit underperforming businesses such as US securitisation, 
while cost management may be improving. However, we believe more aggressive action is required in both these 
areas," Bear Stearns said.
Belgium's Dexia slid 2.5 per cent to Euros 17.04, Societe Generale softened 1.8 per cent to Euros 95.99 and Credit 
Suisse lost 0.5 per cent to SFr62.65. Domestic rival UBS lost 0.2 per cent to SFr49.62.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended 0.6 per cent lower at 1,467.58 points.
With Europe braced for negative consumer confidence data this week, the banking sector could take another 
hammering, dealers said.
"Keep those hatches battened: this squall has set in, with the sector beset by a series of headwinds that defy easy 
resolution," brokerage Collins Stewart said.
Belgo-Dutch financial services group Fortis rose 2.1 per cent to Euros 17.41, swimming against the tide in the 
banking sector on talk that it will acquire a larger than expected share of ABN Amro, the bank it bought with Royal 
Bank of Scotland and Santander.
Anglo Irish Bank also bucked the market to rise 2.9 per cent to Euros 9.65 on hopes that it would would post a 38 
per cent rise in full-year earnings tomorrow.
Natixis adds to gloom for financials
Airlines were among the top losers, with Iberia softening 1.9 per cent to Euros 3.14 as hopes of a bidding war for 
the Spanish carrier faded.
British Airways said it would not exercise the right to buy a 14 per cent stake, making it unlikely that a full takeover 
bid from the British airline group and US investor TPG will go ahead.
The shares are now set to be sold to Spanish bank Caja Madrid, which is building a 23 per cent stake in the airline 
and aiming to keep it in domestic hands.
Ryanair dropped 5.2 per cent to Euros 4.57 and Air France-KLM, which is also in the running to buy Iberia, fell 4.7 
per cent to Euros 24.25.
Scania and Volvo , the Swedish truckmakers, were among the top gainers, lifted by indications the European truck 
market would continue to show robust growth, offsetting weakness in the North American market.
Volvo published data that showed unit sales in the nine months to the end of October rose 2 per cent.
The group's B shares climbed 2.4 per cent to SKr105, while the B shares of Scania, which makes the bulk of its 
earnings in Europe, gained 2.7 per cent to SKR143.75.
Industrial metals groups were in demand. SSAB
, the Swedish group whose steel is used in the truckmaking industry, gained 1 per cent to SKr148.
French steelmaker ArcelorMittal
, rumoured to be eyeing an auto industry steel joint venture in China, was up 0.5 per cent to Euros 48.69.
Carmakers were boosted by hopes that European consumer confidence would survive the worst of the credit 
squeeze of recent months.
Porsche shares were 2.3 per cent higher at Euros 1,403.10, Renault rose 0.7 per cent to Euros 94.65.
In Amsterdam, Dutch conglomerate Philips pared early gains to end 0.3 per cent lower at Euros 28.36 after 
yesterday's acquisition of Genlyte, the US lighting fixtures company.
"We believe the Dollars 2.7bn deal is a positive move by Philips to significantly expand its lighting division in the US 
at an attractive price," Dresdner Kleinwort said in a note.

Body
No-frills airline, Ryanair, today said it will carry a record 13 million passengers to and from Irish airports this year.
Ryanair is now the largest carrier of visitors to Ireland on 135 low fare routes from Britain and Europe.
Ryanair took the opportunity to slam the government on its refusal to approve a second, competing terminal at 
Dublin Airport, which, the airline said, is seriously undermining Ireland's competitiveness.
 "In 2002, Bertie Ahern promised a competing terminal at Dublin Airport but broke this promise and awarded the 
second terminal to the DAA monopoly. The DAA's Terminal 2 has already quadrupled in cost from E200m to 
E800m and is ten times more expensive than other terminals in Europe. This has already led to a doubling of 
parking charges and will lead to a doubling of passenger charges at the DAA monopoly. These unjustified price 
hikes will damage Irish Tourism," it said.

Italy chooses Viterbo as Rome's third airport; to be managed by AdR

Italian transport minister Alessandro Bianchi said Viterbo, in the Lazio region around Rome, has been chosen as 
the capital's third airport after Fiumicino and Ciampino airports.
The construction and management of the airport has been awarded to Gemina SpA unit Aeroporti di Roma, he said 
at a presentation with Lazio regional president Piero Marrazzo.
A Bianchi official said a major part of the Viterbo airport's activity is likely to be with low-cost carriers.
Bianchi has previously said establishing a third airport in the Rome area can relieve noise and environmental 
problems at Ciampino.
Last month, Ryanair Holdings PLC won a court suspension over measures taken by Italian regulators aimed at 
cutting flights at Ciampino.
In further comments, Rome mayor Walter Veltroni said Bianchi had taken the decision on the airport in the time 
scheduled, adding the new Viterbo airport will take pressure off Ciampino.
Viterbo was chosen against a series of technical criteria, including efficient rail links, he said.
Previously, Bianchi said the choice on the third airport also included those at Latina and Frosinone.
In its report on the choice of which of four existing airports to upgrade, the ministry said it also examined Guidonia 
to the east of Rome, closer to the capital than the other three.
Viterbo is to the north of Rome, while Latina and Frosinone are both south.
The ministry ranked the four candidates on capacity to increase the present airport's area, on ability to handle more 
air traffic, ground traffic links, and economic/financial factors, it said.
Viterbo won on lack of competition with other airports south of Rome and on easy upgrading of the rail link, while 
the other three face higher defence ministry costs in moving existing air traffic.
In 2020, Rome expects to handle 56 mln air passengers, including 46 mln at Fiumicino and not more than 3 mln at 
Ciampino, it said.

'There is the need for a third airprot able to absorb 6-8 mln passengers by 2020,' the ministry said.
The ministry said it intends to examine other short-term measures to limit traffic at Ciampino after the court 
suspension obtained by Ryanair.

Highlight: Shares on the Dublin market closed slightly lower today.
Body
Shares on the Dublin market closed slightly lower today as a leading stockbroker said it expects Anglo Irish Bank to 
report strong year results despite the turbulent performance of banking sector in recent times. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 5.41 points at 6595.59.
Irish banks are currently in the eye of the storm, with investors nervous about liquidity and the slowdown in the Irish 
economy, according to Davy Research. 
 However, Davy said in a note that it believes that these fears are "overdone" and that the "market has lost touch 
with the fundamentals". Davy said it expects management to be upbeat on results day (November 28) and to 
reiterate EPS growth of 15-20pc for the coming year to September 2008. "With all banks suffering a slowdown in 
volume growth and the commercial property cycle turning, Anglo Irish Bank needs to convince the market that its 
business model will enable it to outperform its peers. We expect the bank to significantly improve the level of 
disclosure on its loan book, which should go some way to assuaging fears about asset quality. We also expect the 
bank to come out fighting in relation to the liquidity issue," Scott Rankin, analyst at Davy Research said. Shares in 
the financial sector were mixed. Bank of Ireland was up 9c to 9.86 and AIB rose 7c to 13.91. Anglo Irish Bank 
increased 32c to 9.70 and Irish Life and Permanent dropped 20c to 11.60. In the construction sector, CRH was up 
20c to 23.15 and Grafton was down 11c to 6.04. McInerney rose 4c to 1.18 and Kingspan climbed 8c to 13.38. 
Elsewhere, no-frills airline Ryanair fell 13c to 4.69 and bookmaker Paddy Power slipped 50c to 22.15 Other notable 
movers include UTV down 23c at 4.09, DCC down 35c to 16.90 and Iaws down 21c to 14.55. Shares at mobile 
content firm Zamano rose 3c to 0.36 after it announced the acquisition of Red Circle Technologies, a Dublin-based 
provider of digital entertainment content to mobile devices, with operations in the UK, Australia, 0.USA and Ireland. 
Meanwhile, shares at Glanbia were down 9c to 4.49 despite the fact that its Idaho cheese and whey operations 
continue to benefit from strong milk volume growth in the state (where Glanbia is the largest dairy processor). Milk 
output in the state rose by 6.2pc year-on-year (yoy) in October; this compared to a 4.1pc yoy rise in overall US milk 
ISEQ closes day slightly lower
output. In Texas and New Mexico states, which supply milk to Glanbia's Southwest cheese joint venture, milk 
output in the month rose yoy by 5.5pc and 1.5pc respectively. Increased yields, reflecting an improvement in the 
milk price feed cost ratio, spurred higher than trend line output growth this year, Davy said in a note.

The ISEQ put in what under normal conditions would be considered an impressive performance today.
At the close, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 281.51 points to 6,624.09.
Since Friday last, however, the ISEQ is down 640 points.
 Bargain hunters sifted through the carnage of the past four days looking for bargain-basement prices and found 
banking and construction shares at some of their lowest levels in years. While the ISEQ nudged in to positive 
territory after some eight straight days in the red, no broker's analysts was prepared to say that the worst was over 
just yet. Stock markets across the world are suffering due to the slump caused by a crisis in confidence in the global 
money and financial markets, which was triggered largely by the sub-prime mortgage debacle in the US. Experts in 
the US and elsewhere are predicted that share prices will continue to tumble in the coming days and weeks. Dublin 
analysts agreed, with Davy's Robbie Kelleher admitting that there could be more pain to come after the bloodbath 
of the past week. And there was precious little in the way of inspiration to buy from the global markets with Wall St 
still in holiday mode and European stocks gaining modestly. Banks were the main gainers in Dublin but trading was 
still relatively tentative with investors still digesting the news that financial stocks are down an average of 45pc since 
January with the fear that the fall-out from the global credit crunch could turn up more surprises in the days and 
week to come. AIB stocks gained 85c to E13.80, Bank of Ireland - the biggest faller of the week - rose by 87c to 
E9.7, Irish Life and Permanent advanced 54c to E11.80 and Anglo Irish gained 22c to E9.14 as investors keenly 
await its interim results in just under two weeks. Construction shares also inched up with CRH gaining 33c to 
E22.73, Kingspan was up 38c to E13.3 while McInerney was up 1c to E1.15. Shares in no-frills carrier, Ryanair, are 
now down 19pc in a single month despite gaining 22c yesterday to E4.82. The stock is now down 13.3pc compared 
to this time last year and 27.3pc off 12-month highs achieved in January. Over the same time period, European 
airlines in general are down 15.5pc. "All of this has left Ryanair trading on 13.3 times forward predicted earnings, 
the lowest in three years," said Stephen Furlong, Davy's aviation analyst. Aer Lingus stocks closed flat at E1.93 and 
ISEQ gains but not a rebound yet
are still a far cry from the airline's initial price offering of E2.20 last year. Elsewhere, DCC yesterday announced that 
DCC Healthcare has acquired Squadron Medical Limited. Based in Chesterfield, Squadron procures and supplies 
medical and surgical products on a just-in-time basis to point of use within hospitals. DCC's shares jumped 28c on 
the news to E16.87. Building shares regained some of the losses made earlier in the week with CRH up 25c to 
E22.65 and Grafton advanced by 20c to E6.14. Davy noted that Grafton on Thursday purchased a further 150,000 
of its own shares at an average cost of E6.00. This brings the total amount to just shy of 5.8m shares (2.4pc of the 
share capital) at a cost of just under E43m.

Ryanair today accused the Dublin Airport Authority of lying to the public over car parking charges at Dublin Airport.
"The DAA Monopoly today increases its parking charges by 50pc. This is the second 50pc price hike since 2005 
which has seen the cost of parking at the DAA monopoly double from E20 to E40 in just two years," it said.
"DAA spin doctors were this morning misleading the media and the public, claiming that 60pc of passengers use 
the car park for less than one hour! This is false. The vast majority are paying twice as much as two years ago 
because of the Dublin Airport Monopoly's price gouging," it added.

Ryanair files suit over alleged Greek state aid to Olympic, 'happy' with Aer Lingus losses

Ryanair Holdings PLC filed a lawsuit Thursday against the European Commission its third such action this month in 
complaints challenging funding of national airlines by European governments.
In its latest suit, Ryanair accused EU competition authorities of failing to investigate €500 million (US$740 million) in 
money paid by the Greek government to Olympic Airlines.
Last week, Ryanair filed a suit accusing the EU of inaction over German government funding of a loss-making 
terminal at Munich Airport used by Lufthansa. Two weeks ago, it took the same action, claiming that France 
subsidized the airport charges and other costs for domestic Air France flights.
All three suits have been filed at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, the second-highest EU court, 
which appears in danger of having its caseload overwhelmed by lawsuits involving Ryanair.
Ryanair is the target of several suits already filed by other European airlines, which allege that Ryanair has struck 
government-subsidized deals with far-flung airports from Finland to Sardinia. Ryanair's Irish rival, Aer Lingus, also 
filed a suit in Luxembourg this week calling on the EU to force Ryanair to sell its shareholding in Aer Lingus.
At a Dublin news conference, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary accused EU authorities of bias in favor of 
Europe's flag-carrier airlines.
O'Leary said Greece had paid Olympic about €500 million over the past year, "mostly for 'unpaid services' allegedly 
provided by Olympic to the government. However, the (European) Commission has refused to do anything about 
this since 2006, which left us with no alternative but to challenge the commission's inaction in the European courts."
He said the commission "repeatedly ignores blatant state aid to Air France, Lufthansa, Olympic, Alitalia and others." 
He said flag-carrier airlines "would never fly to smaller airports and are simply trying to prevent competition and 
consumer choice."
Ryanair files suit over alleged Greek state aid to Olympic, 'happy' with Aer Lingus losses
O'Leary said he remained confident that Ryanair eventually would acquire Aer Lingus, regardless of an EU verdict 
in June ruling out its takeover plan as likely to create an Irish monopoly.
He said Ryanair had suffered a paper loss of €60 million (US$89 million) from its purchase of a 29.4 percent stake 
in Aer Lingus.
"I'm celebrating the fall in value in our investment in Aer Lingus. It's an accurate response to the management's 
current performance," O'Leary said.
"Aer Lingus is likely to be taken over. But the most likely candidate to take over Aer Lingus is Ryanair, because 
frankly nobody else has any interest in taking over Aer Lingus," he said. "It's too small and too high-cost to survive 
as an independent airline."
Ryanair shares were up 0.7 percent at €4.55 (US$6.74) amid another day of heavy losses on the Irish Stock 
Exchange. Aer Lingus was up 2.1 percent at €1.94 (US$2.87) still 12 percent below its September 2006 flotation 
price, and 31 percent below Ryanair's takeover price offered in October 2006.
Ryanair has become the largest shareholder in Aer Lingus. But analysts say it stands little chance of reaching the 
50 percent threshold for a viable takeover because the government and Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts, 
which together hold about 45 percent of shares, oppose Ryanair's plans.

Mr O'Leary claimed that the CAR's staff has increased by 40pc over the past six years, with average employee 
salaries almost doubling from E48,000 to E86,000.
 The airline chief also had harsh words for the CAR's policy towards the Dublin Airport Authority. Mr O'Leary

Nearly E2 billion was knocked off the value of Irish shares again today while peers in Europe, Asia and the US 
surged, leaving Irish brokers bewildered. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 116.46 points at 6652.01
The culprit behind the latest fall is CFDs- a Contract For Difference, which is a contract between two parties, buyer 
and seller, stipulating that the seller will pay to the buyer the difference between the current value of an asset and 
its value at contract.
 Investors are now bailing out of these investment vehicles and dragging shares down with them at the same time 
putting the Dublin market into a full-scale crisis. AIB Mortgage Bank, a unit of AIB, postponed plans for a three-year 
covered euro bond issue, citing "unfavourable market conditions". A Reuters report this afternoon quoted an 
unnamed AIB spokesperson as saying: "In light of the extreme volatility in the credit markets, AIB Mortgage Bank 
has decided not to proceed for the time being with its planned covered bond transaction". The move to postpone 
the bond marks the first instance where AIB has acknowledged the negative effect of the global credit crunch on its 
operations. In the financial sector, Bank of Ireland dropped 31c to 9.67 and Anglo Irish Bank slipped 14c to 9.03. 
AIB fell 62c to 13.44 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 48c to 12.75. Construction shares fared little better. 
CRH was down 5c to 22.85 and Grafton dropped 3c to 14c to 6.32. Kingspan fell 33c to 13.92 and McInerney 
slipped 13c to 1.07. Grafton bought back a further 250k shares on Monday, which brings the total purchased to date 
to 4.795 million. The total cost of these purchases has been E36.6 million, which implies an average price of just 
over 760 cent. Elsewhere, no-frills airline Ryanair fell 27c to 4.65 and Irish pharmaceutical company Elan dropped 
46c to 15.30. Other notable movers include Smurfit Kappa down 50c to 11.50, Tullow down 62c to 8.28 and Abbey 
down 31c to 6.09. At an EGM on Monday, Abbey shareholders overwhelmingly passed a resolution to allow the 
company to purchase up to 15pc of the issued share capital. However, Peter Gunn, analyst at Goodbody 
Stockbrokers said, "We believe this could add 14pc to full year (FY09) earnings. Full utilisation of the authority will

see Gallagher Holdings raise its holding from 35pc to c.41.5pc. While this move will be earnings accretive, we 
believe the share price will continue to be weighed down by the weak Irish housing market and increasingly bleaker 
outlook in the UK. Executive Chairman, Charles Gallagher commented that the housing markets in both Ireland and 
the UK slowed in the last six weeks, impacted by the on-going 'Credit Crunch' in financial markets." Also, shares at 
drinks group C and C rose 11c to 4.26 on news that its peer Scottish and Newcastle (S and N) said in its trading

Ryanair has dismissed the Aer Lingus announcement of its intention to submit an appeal to the European Court of 
First Instance (CFI) seeking to force Ryanair to dispose of its 29pc shareholding in Aer Lingus.
This comes after Aer Lingus said yesterday that it has lodgd a formal appeal with the CFI in Luxembourg as part of 
the legal process towards removing Ryanair from its shareholder register
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said in a statement:"This appeal would seem to be another 
smokescreen from the Board of Aer Lingus to distract from its awful performance over the past 12 months. Aer 
Lingus's share price closed last week at E2.15, almost 25pc lower than Ryanair's E2.80 offer in October last year, 
and some 5c per share less than Aer Lingus's original float price in September 2006. "It is clear that the market has 
little faith in the Board of Aer Lingus, who last year advised shareholders to reject an offer of E2.80, but have 
presided over the withdrawal of its Dubai route, a succession of labour problems and the collapse in its share price 
"Perhaps if the Board of Aer Lingus spent more time improving the management of the airline and its share price, 
they wouldn't have to waste time worrying about Ryanair's minority shareholding".

A critical employment law ruling won by Belgian cabin crew at low-fare carrier Ryanair's operation at Charleroi in 
March 2005 has been nullified.
The Belgian labour court has ruled that for employees whose place of work - an aircraft - traverses borders, and 
therefore jurisdictions, the only court competent to rule is one in the country where the employer is based and 
where the aircraft are registered. In the case of Ryanair this means Ireland.
According to law firm Eversheds, counsel to Ryanair, the claimants are proposing to take this to Belgium's supreme 
court, and they have three months in which to do so.
The three Charleroi-based cabin crew were dismissed by Ryanair in April 2002, and in March 2005 the Charleroi 
labour court ruled that they had been unfairly dismissed and were due compensation according to Belgian 
employment law. That ruling rejected Ryanair's claims that Irish employment law prevailed.
But on 7 September in the labour court at Mons, Belgium, the court ruled that Belgian law did not apply to those 
whose place of work was in aircraft that traversed jurisdictions, whatever their nationality or the country in which 
they live and begin and end their work each day.
Ryanair's human resources director Eddie Wilson says: "We believe the Belgian court has made a sensible 
decision [which] will help to clarify the position for other airline businesses employing workers that regularly cross 
jurisdictions."
Eversheds says: "Airline staff who spend the majority of their time on board aircraft will be clear that their 
employment rights are restricted to those that apply in the country where their employer is situated."

An index of European stocks traded on U.S. exchanges fell Monday, with financial stocks recording some of the 
largest losses after a Goldman Sachs analyst cut estimates for U.S. banks.
The Bank of New York Europe ADR index lost 4.95, or 2.6 percent, to 185.83 in afternoon trading. ADRs are 
American Depositary Receipts. Out of more than 100 stocks on the index, about a dozen were up Monday 
afternoon.
Analyst William Tanona cut his earnings estimates for large banks through 2009, saying larger write-offs are on the 
way because U.S. housing prices will continue to decline. Housing is a principal determinant of credit quality 
because borrowers whose homes are losing value lose both the incentive and the means to pay their bills.
"The credit markets remain extraordinarily challenging and we see limited relief over the near term," he said in a 
client note. Tanona also downgraded shares of Citigroup Inc., and his comments pressured financial stocks on both 
sides of the Atlantic.
Shares of UBS AG of Germany fell $2.58, or 5.4 percent, to $44.96.
HSBC Holdings PLC, a British bank, lost $2.20, or 2.5 percent, to $85.11.
Britain's Barclays Group PLC slid $1.42, or 3.4 percent, to $40.62.
Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC, an Irish airline, shed $2.15, or 4.9 percent, to $42 after a rival airline, Aer Lingus 
Group PLC, said it will try to have Ryanair removed as a shareholder.
On the positive side, shares of Deutsche Telekom AG rose to a two-year high on reports that the company could 
cut about 400 jobs by merging its accounting departments. The stock gained 47 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $22.21,

Unilever NV, the Dutch segment of the consumer goods company, inched up 8 cents to $35.65. Earlier in the

Aer Lingus Group PLC filed a lawsuit Monday in the European Union's second-highest court in hopes of forcing its 
main rival, budget airline Ryanair, to sell its shares in Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus wants the European Court of First Instance to rule that the European Commission, the executive arm of 
the 27-nation bloc, does have power to order Ryanair to sell its 29.4 percent holding in Aer Lingus. The commission 
previously has said it cannot do this under existing competition laws.
In a statement, Aer Lingus said it also has asked the Luxembourg court, "as a matter of urgency, to make an order 
to prevent Ryanair from interfering in the running of Aer Lingus' business pending judgment on the appeal."
Ryanair had no immediate comment. Europe's no-frills leader previously has argued that, despite its investment, it 
has been unable to exercise any influence over Aer Lingus policy.
Ryanair quickly became the top shareholder in Aer Lingus after the Irish government privatized the previously state-
owned airline in September 2006.
But Ryanair's attempt to seize its major Irish competitor failed because key shareholders chiefly the government 
and employee-controlled trusts oppose Ryanair and have ensured that the airline does not reach the minimum 50 
percent holding for a takeover.
European Union competition authorities further undermined Ryanair's ambitions, ruling in June that a merged Aer 
Lingus-Ryanair operation would create an Irish monopoly.
Ryanair condemned that verdict as politically biased and at odds with previous EU approvals of airline mergers. It 
vowed to sue the EU to overturn the monopoly verdict and to retain its Aer Lingus holding until then.
Ryanair's rights as senior Aer Lingus shareholder are already the subject of a protracted dispute between the 
airlines.
Aer Lingus files EU lawsuit seeking removal of Ryanair as its top shareholder
Aer Lingus has refused two formal Ryanair demands for an extraordinary general meeting a right normally afforded 
under Irish corporate law to any investor with a minimum 10 percent holding. Aer Lingus argued that it would not 
take instructions from Ryanair because this would violate EU competition laws.
"It is our intention to deal with the presence of Ryanair on our shareholder register decisively through short-term 
interim measures, as well as seeking a speedy permanent resolution from the Court of First Instance," said Aer 
Lingus Chairman John Sharman. He declined to specify what interim measures he had in mind, besides continued 
refusal to convene an EGM.
Ryanair wanted shareholders to vote on reversing Aer Lingus' most controversial move since privatization: its 
imminent transfer of Heathrow Airport services from Ireland's major western airport, Shannon, to a new hub in the 
British territory of Northern Ireland.
Irish politicians and Aer Lingus employees widely oppose Aer Lingus' withdrawal of economically valuable links 
from Shannon. But the government of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has dismissed pressure to intervene, arguing 
that Aer Lingus' commercial decisions should be respected.
On the Irish Stock Exchange, Aer Lingus shares were unchanged Monday at €2.15 (US$3.15), while Ryanair fell 
1.6 percent to €4.97 (US$7.28).

The Nasdaq 100 index fell in midday trading Monday, weighed down in part by shares of Leap Wireless 
International Inc. after a Lehman Brothers analyst downgraded the company on competitive concerns.
The index, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, fell 20.20 
points to 2,028.42 in midday trading. Only 17 of the 100 stocks rose, with three unchanged. The broader Nasdaq 
composite fell 36.41 points to 2,600.83.
Leap fell $2.62, or 6.8 percent, to $35.80 after Lehman downgraded the stock to "Equal weight" from "Overweight."
Broomfield, Colo.-based Level 3 Communications Inc. shed 19 cents, or 6 percent, to $3.
Ireland-based Ryanair Holdings PLC fell $2.48, or 5.6 percent, to $41.67, after Aer Lingus Group PLC said it will 
lodge a complaint with the European Union's Court of First Instance to remove Ryanair as a shareholder.
For over a year, Aer Lingus has been resisting Ryanair's efforts to buy the rest of the company it doesn't already 
own. Aer Lingus rejected a 1.48 billion euro takeover offer from Ryanair in September 2006.
On the gaining side, EchoStar Communications Corp. rose $4.72, or 11.9 percent, to $44.53 after an analyst 
upgraded the stock on valuation and speculation that AT&T Inc. will buy the satellite TV operator within a year.
Activision Inc. gained 31 cents to $20.49. The company was named the top U.S. console and handheld gaming 
publisher for October by the NPD Group, based in part on strong sales of the Xbox 360 game "Guitar Hero III: 
Legends of Rock."
VeriSign Inc. added 47 cents to $36.53. A First Analysis Securities analyst said the Mountain View, Calif.-based 
company's plans to sell-off some of its "hodge-podge" businesses will lead to a "cleaner operation for management 
to run and investors to understand."

Aer Lingus Group PLC said it will today lodge a formal appeal with the EU Court of First Instance in Luxembourg as 
part of the legal process towards removing Ryanair Holdings PLC from its shareholder register.
If successful, the appeal would enable the EU Commission to order Ryanair to dispose of its 29.4 pct stake in its 
main competitor. The move comes after the EU Commission's recent decision that it does not have the legal 
authority to order a sell down of Ryanair's shares under merger regulation.
Aer Lingus said it is confident the regulation does, in fact, give the Commission that power as the stake was part of 
an original takeover attempt which the Commission prohibited.
The Irish flag carrier said it has also asked the court to make an order to prevent Ryanair from interfering in the 
running of its business pending judgement on the appeal.
'Aer Lingus is forging ahead with its plans for growth and refuses to be undermined by its competitor. It is our 
intention to deal with the presence of Ryanair on our shareholder register decisively through short-term interim 
measures, as well as seeking a speedy permanent resolution from the Court of First Instance,' John Sharman, Aer 
Lingus' chairman said in a statement.

Shares on the Dublin market began the week down 2.9 percent the Irish banking sector mirrored the losses 
suffered by their European peers. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 200.78 points at 6768.47
Volatility in equity markets shows no sign of going away anytime though on balance most of the European bourses 
and the main US equity indices were broadly unchanged last week, according to Robbie Kelleher, analyst at Davy 
Research. 
 Even some of the main bank indices were up on the week, most notably both the UK FTSE 350 bank index (2.1pc) 
and the European FTSE E300 bank index (1.1pc). But the US S and P bank index was down over 3pc on the week, 
he said. Once again Ireland underperformed, with the ISEQ down 2.3pc on the week, and is now trading below 
7,000 and more than 30pc off its early-June peak. It is now back to levels of early December 2005. Among the 
larger stocks, both the banks and CRH again fell on the week and underperformed their relevant European sector 
benchmarks. It now leaves the Irish market trading on a forward of not much more than 8x, the lowest on record 
and at a discount of some 35pc to the main European benchmarks, he said. Meanwhile, in the financial sector, 
Bank of Ireland was down 7c to 9.99 and AIB fell 41c to 14.21. Irish Life and Permanent dropped 47c to 13.28 and 
Anglo Irish Bank slipped 18c to 9.30. CRH fell E1.23 to 22.85 and Grafton was down 28c to 6.45. McInerney slipped 
2c to 1.23 and Kingspan dropped 40c to 14.20. Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power fell 53c to 23.07 and no-frills 
airline Ryanair was down 18c to 4.87 Other notable movers include Kerry down 50c to 20.38, FBD down 40c to 
20.60 and C and C down 15c to 4.18 Also, shares Irish pharmaceutical company Elan were up 36c to 16.18 despite 
a further negative opinion (on appeal) from the Committee for Medical Products for Human Use (CHMP) on Tysabri 
(Crohn's) came hot on the heels of a similar announcement on Cimzia, UCB's candidate for the same disease 
category. The CHMP remained concerned that the data on Tysabri did not demonstrate the requisite evidence on 
disease maintenance. In addition, the agency also continued to have concerns regarding the safety profile of the 
ISEQ closes day nearly 3pc lower
drug in this disease category. Elan will now await the final referral to the EC, which rules on final approvals. It looks 
very likely that approval will not be granted. Jack Gorman, analyst at Davy Research said, "Although disappointing, 
this needs to be put in context. EU/RoW revenues from Crohn's were forecast to account for some USD61 million, 
or 3.9pc, of our 2010 forecast for Tysabri of USD1548 million. Indeed, we still maintain that a qualified approval in 
the US is possible given the encouraging comments from the advisory panel meeting last summer. We expect to 
hear a decision on this by Jan 13th 2008 and quite possibly by year-end." Shares at UTV dropped 28c to 4.32 after 
disappointing JNLR listenership data released late last week by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland revealed a 
disappointing performance by UTV's local stations in the 12 months to the end of September. All four of UTV's 
stations in the market saw their reach decline relative to the previous period, with Q102 dropping 1pc to 9pc, Cork's 
96/103FM also down 1pc at 46pc, Limerick's Live 95FM seeing a 1pc decline to 58pc and LMFM falling 2pc to

Aer Lingus said it will today lodge a formal appeal with the EU Court of First Instance (CFI) in Luxembourg as part 
of the legal process towards removing Ryanair from its shareholder register. 
If successful, the appeal would enable the EU Commission to order Ryanair to dispose of its 29.4 pct stake in its

The move comes after the EU Commission's recent decision that it does not have the legal authority to order a sell 
down of Ryanair's shares under merger regulation.

dispose of its shareholding in Aer Lingus. A spokesman for EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "In the 
view of the Commission, it is unable under the EU merger regulation to require Ryanair to reduce its minority stake 
in Aer Lingus...Essentially, this is the case because the minority stake does not confer control and the merger 
regulation only allows the commission to intervene if a party has effective control of another company". Responding 
to the EU's ruling, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary last month said the low-cost carrier "will be a long-term 
shareholder in Aer Lingus", adding that he believed the EC had "made the right decision".

The threat of an imminent strike at Ireland's Aer Lingus airline receded Friday after daylong negotiations with 
government-appointed mediators.
The Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, which represents cabin crew and ground staff, had 
threatened to walk off the job for two days next week because Aer Lingus has imposed a pay freeze and introduced 
tougher contracts for temporary workers.
But leaders of Ireland's largest union said they would gather Aer Lingus shop stewards to vote Saturday on the 
mediators' plan, which calls for strike action to be postponed during two weeks of intensive negotiations.
Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said he was confident that the airline's services which have been 
repeatedly threatened with strike action in recent weeks would operate normally next week.
SIPTU national industrial secretary Michael Halpenny said his side was "satisfied that sufficient progress has been 
made."
The mediators said they would reconvene Aer Lingus and SIPTU union chiefs Nov. 28 to see whether their 
arguments had been resolved and, if not, to present them with a final compromise plan by Dec. 3.
Mannion has repeatedly confronted union forces this year in the airline, which was privatized in September 2006 
and faces tough competition on its home turf from no-frills carrier Ryanair.
He withheld planned pay rises across Aer Lingus' 3,700-member labor force this month because union chiefs have 
refused to accept a company plan to reform work practices, particularly shift and overtime rules.
Mannion says the plan would trim airline expenses by 20 million euros ($29 million) annually. Halpenny counters 
that the airline is not seeking to boost efficiency, just slash employees' pay and benefits.
Threat of strike at Ireland 's Aer Lingus recedes after daylong talks
Mannion earlier this week sent all SIPTU-represented employees a letter ordering them to confirm, in writing, 
whether they would report to work normally next week and, if not, to say why they were striking. A refusal to 
respond, or an inadequate explanation, had meant they would be suspended from the payroll.
Mannion employed nearly identical tactics last month when confronting the airline's 480 pilots, who were refusing to 
help recruit and train pilots for a new hub in the British territory of Northern Ireland. At that time, the threat of 
suspensions without pay brought both sides together for day-and-night negotiations that produced a compromise.

The Dublin market closed the week slightly lower on tensions at Aer Lingus and a plunge of 6pc by bookmaker 
Paddy Power. 
On Friday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 12.73 points at 6969.25
Shares at the Aer Lingus were unchanged at 2.15 after its rival Ryanair confirmed that it received an approach from 
the airline about the possibility of using its planes if Tuesday's planned strike goes ahead. 
 Ryanair said that it would be prepared to make the planes available and would put on extra flights for any stranded 
Aer Lingus passengers. Talks between Aer Lingus unions and management took place at the National 
Implementation Body to avert a series of crippling strikes at the airline next week. SIPTU has served notice of four-
rolling strikes on Tuesday and Friday of next week in a row over the company's cost-cutting proposals The union 
has also warned of an all-out strike if the airline carries out its threat to suspend workers who take part in the two-
day action. Meanwhile, financial shares were mixed. Bank of Ireland rose 11c to 10.04 and AIB climbed 16c to 
14.64. Anglo Irish Bank remained flat at 9.52 and Irish Life and Permanent fell 8c to 13.87. In the construction 
sector, CRH fell 5c to 24.00 and Grafton rose 11c to 6.77. Kingspan was up 16c to 14.56 and McInerney was up 1c 
to 1.25. Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power fell E1.94c to 24.06 and no-frills airline Ryanair was down 11c to 5.09. 
Other notable movers include Smurfit Kappa down 10c to 12.75, FBD down 10c to 20.90 and Icon down 50c to 
37.50. Shares at drinks group C and C were down 4c to 4.38 after it said that it is cutting its staff numbers by 150. 
The cost will be E15 million in the current year with an ensuing cost reduction of E20 million, though higher raw 
material costs will mean that the net cost savings annually will be E10 million, of which E8 million will accrue in 
FY09. Some reorganisational changes were also announced in the light of Brendan McGuinness' impending 
retirement. A new position of managing director of Great Britian will be created to improve the marketing and sales 
effort in that market. Liam Igoe, analyst at Goodbody Research said, "The costs associated with the rationalisation, 
at E15 million, are significantly less than we had anticipated. However, the statement by C and C is narrowly 
ISEQ closes week lower on Paddy Power
focused on reorganisation with the manufacturing end. We expect larger savings again to arise from lower 
marketing spend as a result of the absence of the Continental European marketing campaign in FY09. The most 
important issue in determining the FY09 outcome, however, is the trend in volume growth, and we won't get a 
proper fix on this until summer 08." Also shares at support services group DCC dropped 19c to 19.12 despite Davy 
Research saying that the value of underlying business is being overlooked. "DCC's interim results demonstrated the 
strength of its business model with strong performances across Sercom, Energy and Environmental Services. In 
aggregate, H1 earnings were 4pc ahead of forecasts, leading us to upgrade our divisional profits by 5pc for both 
this year and next. For FY 2007, we now forecast operating profit (pre-exceptionals) of E166.6 million versus E159 
million previously. This equates to EPS of 164c," it said in a note.

Shares on the Dublin market closed lower today as a leading stockbroker expressed their confidence in building 
giant CRH, saying their de-rating is "unjustified".
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 42.15 points at 6981.98
Although US and German residential markets have been weak through the third quarter, many of CRH's key 
markets remain robust, according to Davy Research. 
 Every results release over the past two weeks has pointed to exceptionally strong demand in Eastern Europe, with 
double-digit revenue growth reported across the board, it said France, Benelux and the UK have also seen steady 
demand through the third quarter. The notable exception is Germany, where residential construction activity has 
slowed considerably. US residential markets continue to deteriorate, but the spill-over to non-residential has yet to 
fully materialise. Non-residential markets are reportedly growing, albeit at a slower pace than earlier in the year, it 
said. "We find it hard to reconcile CRH's current share price with the Q3 results and outlook of the group's peers. 
CRH trades at a significant discount to the US materials sector, yet every US operator has greater exposure to the 
housing slowdown. Despite having minimal exposure to the housing market in Germany, the group also discounts 
the European sector. We believe CRH's de-rating is unjustified and reiterate our price target of 3600c," it said in a 
note. CRH was down 54c to 24.00 and McInerney fell 2c to 1.26. Grafton slipped 8c to 6.63 and Kingspan dropped 
12c to 14.43. In the financial sector, Bank of Ireland rose 5c to 9.88 and Anglo Irish Bank fell 51c to 9.59. AIB fell 4c 
to 14.34 and Irish Life and Permanent dropped 60c to 13.80 Elsewhere, no- frills airline Ryanair fell 5c to 5.10 and 
bookmaker Paddy Power slipped 55c to 26.30. Other notable movers include Kerry Group up 12c to 20.68, C and C 
up 5c to 4.34, Iaws down 34c to 16.20 Shares at UTV remained flat at 4.60 despite its parent ITV saying that this 
year is "ending on a decent high" in terms of advertising revenues. Executive Chairman Michael Grade said that 
ITV1 advertising revenue in November was up slightly year-on-year and that there was no obvious slowdown in the 
advertising market. "This is positive news for UTV, which holds the ITV franchise in Northern Ireland and generates

43pc of operating profits from television. At its interim results, UTV confirmed a record share of 2.93pc of ITV's 
revenue," according to Conor Duffy, analyst at Davy Research. Also, shares at Irish pharmaceutical company Elan 
rose 20c to 15.65 after its partner in the development of oral Alzheimer's Disease candidate ELND005, Transition 
Therapeutics, said the product completed Phase I studies during the summer in its first quarter results. 
Approximately 110 subjects were exposed to the drug in those trials - ELND005 was found to be well tolerated at all 
doses with no serious or adverse events observed. It was also found that the levels of drug reaching the brain and 
CSF were similar to those shown to be effective in animal models for Alzheimer's Disease. In October, Elan paid 
the second half of the USD15 million upfront licence fee to Transition. Transition has indicated that the product 
remains on track to start Phase II trials by the end of 2007 or early 2008.

Air France is suing Ryanair for 'slanderous accusations', the airline said.
Air France has filed a law suit against the Irish low-cost airline with the Bobigny court of first instance in France, and 
is seeking compensation for damages.
'Ryanair has broadly advertised to the press that it is launching proceedings with the European Commission 
denouncing the alleged collusion between Air France and two other European airlines,' Air France said.
'It is basing its complaint on the mere fact that Air France and the two airlines concerned increased their fares on 
the same day, a few hours apart, following implementation of a fuel surcharge,' it added.
Air France said it considers the facts 'slanderous accusations' not only because they are 'pure fabrication' but also 
because 'Ryanair deliberately leaked the accusations to the media.'

C&W hiked its Europe, Asia and US full-year guidance by 35 mln stg to 205-215 mln stg, but cut its international 
dollar guidance by 20 mln usd to 820-840 mln usd, mainly blaming poor performance in Jamaica. The group also

Ryanair sues European Commission over German funding of Munich airport terminal

Bargain carrier Ryanair said Wednesday it is suing the European Commission over its refusal to investigate 
whether German government funding for a Munich airport terminal amounts to illegal state aid for Lufthansa AG.
The suit, filed in the European Court of First Instance, is the latest salvo between Ryanair and EU competition 
authorities.
For the past two years Ryanair has accused European leaders of demonstrating bias in favor of the continent's 
national flag carriers, citing a range of government financial supports benefiting Lufthansa, Air France, Alitalia and 
Olympic Airways of Greece.
Ryanair Holdings PLChas been subjected to a series of EU investigations into its deals with far-flung, small airports, 
most recently in July when investigators began probing whether Ryanair's exceptionally cheap contracts with three 
airports in Germany and Finland violated competition laws. The EU also is looking into Ryanair's contracts with 
airports in the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Malta.
The Ryanair announcement came on the same day that European Consumer Affairs Commissioner Maglena 
Kuneva published a report alleging widespread deceptive practices in the online sales of airline tickets.
The report did not single out Ryanair, which pioneered the rise of Web-based sales in Europe and is frequently 
criticized by consumer groups for its plethora of add-on charges, including for conventional check-ins and use of 
credit cards. But Kuneva warned that offending airlines would be identified in four months if they didn't reform how 
their Web sites tacked on costs to ticket prices.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair had waited two years for EU authorities to act on the airline's original 
complaint against German state aid to build and operate Terminal 2 in Munich.
Ryanair sues European Commission over German funding of Munich airport terminal
O'Leary said Lufthansa and its partner airlines enjoyed "exclusive use" of the terminal, which was built chiefly with 
more than 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in state aid. He said the terminal had run up losses exceeding 100 million 
euros ($140 million) annually.
"No private investor would have invested in the loss-making facility and then granted exclusive access to just one 
airline. Lufthansa is therefore receiving substantial state aid at Munich Airport, which distorts competition in the 
European air transport market," O'Leary said.
Ryanair mounted a similarly themed lawsuit last week against the European Commission, alleging it has ignored a 
previous complaint against French government policies that allegedly favor Air France.
EU antitrust authorities further annoyed Ryanair in June by rejecting its takeover terms for rival Irish carrier Aer 
Lingus, ruling that a combined operation would create a Ryanair monopoly in Ireland.
The EU in this decade has approved a string of other European mergers involving Air France, Dutch carrier KLM, 
Lufthansa and the defunct Swissair.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said Wednesday it is suing the European Commission over its refusal to investigate whether 
German government funding for a Munich airport terminal amounts to illegal state aid for Lufthansa AG.
The suit filed in the European Court of First Instance, the second-highest EU court, is the latest salvo in an apparent 
tit-for-tat battle between Ryanair and EU competition authorities.
For the past two years Ryanair has accused European leaders of demonstrating bias in favor of the continent's

O'Leary said Lufthansa and its partner airlines enjoyed "exclusive use" of the terminal, which was built chiefly with 
more than €1 billion (US$1.4 billion) in state aid. He said the terminal had run up losses exceeding €100 million 
(US$140 million) annually.
"No private investor would have invested in the loss-making facility and then granted exclusive access to just one 
airline. Lufthansa is therefore receiving substantial state aid at Munich Airport, which distorts competition in the

"Munich Airport's refusal to allow Ryanair to use this facility has subjected passengers in Bavaria to the stranglehold 
of Lufthansa's high fares and fuel surcharges," he said.
Ryanair mounted a similarly themed lawsuit last week against the European Commission alleging it has ignored a 
previous Ryanair complaint against French government policies that allegedly favor Air France. That lawsuit was 
also filed in the European Court of First Instance.
"The French government's operation of massively discounted domestic airport fees in France almost all of which 
supports Air France amounts to approximately €1 billion (US$1.4 billion) of illegal state aid to the benefit of Air 
France, yet the commission has refused to do anything about this for the last 18 months," O'Leary said.
EU antitrust authorities further annoyed Ryanair in June by rejecting its takeover terms for rival Irish carrier Aer 
Lingus, ruling that a combined operation would create a Ryanair monopoly in Ireland.

The European Commission said it is aware that Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has launched a court 
action under EU state aid rules for failure to act in connection will an allegation of state aid to German flag-carrier 
Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
Transport commissioner Jacques Barrot's spokesman said the the commission has not yet seen the content of the 
case lodged by Ryanair.
The commission said it has taken action on the Lufthansa issue and has written to the German authorities to 
request information and clarifications on Nov 18, 2005; July 31, 2006; June 6, 2007; and October 3, 2007.
Replies were received on Jan 18, 2006; Aug 8, 2006; Aug 28, 2007; Sept 17, 2007; and Sept 21, 2007, it added.
The spokesman said the commission is expecting a response from the German authorities to its last letter at the 
beginning of December, and that it is examining any possible advantage given in the context of a state aid 
investigation into the provision and operation of the Munich Airport Terminal 2 and inquiries in relation to this case 
are already at an advanced stage.
He added: 'Cases of this type are complex and take time -- a time-span of just under 18 months is not unusual. In 
these situations, the choice is often between investigating a case quickly and investigating the case correctly. The 
Commission will always opt for the latter.'
Earlier, Ryanair said it has started legal proceedings at the EU's second-highest court -- the Court of First Instance -
- alleging the commission failed to act on its complaint about the exclusive use of the terminal by Lufthansa and 
Star Alliance and called on the EU 'to start promoting competition'.

No-frills airline Ryanair today said it has lodged a case in the European Court of First Instance against the 
European Commission's failure to act on Ryanair's complaint regarding "illegal" State aid granted by the German 
authorities to Lufthansa at Terminal 2 in Munich Airport. 
"The Commission has ignored Ryanair's calls for an investigation of this obvious abuse of the EU State aid rules for 
over two years," the airline said. 
Announcing the launch of these proceedings, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, said, "Lufthansa / Star Alliance 
have exclusive use of Terminal 2 in Munich, which was provided at a cost of E1.5 billion (over E1 billion paid by the 
German Government and the Regional Authorities), and which has led to the airport incurring losses of over E100 
million in 2004-2005. No private investor would have invested in the loss making facility and then granted exclusive 
access to just one airline. Lufthansa is therefore receiving substantial State aid at Munich airport, which distorts 
competition in the European air transport market. 
 "We have called on the European Commission to investigate these serious distortions of competition in favour of 
Lufthansa at Munich. Munich Airport's refusal to allow Ryanair to use this facility has subjected passengers in 
Bavaria to the stranglehold of Lufthansa's high fares and fuel surcharges while Lufthansa has unfairly benefited 
from substantial amounts of State aid. "Ryanair has been left with no alternative but to challenge the Commission's 
inaction in the European courts. We are calling on the Commission to start promoting competition and to stop 
protecting flag carrier high fare airlines which continue to receive large amounts of unlawful State aid."

Ireland's Aer Lingus airline calls mass staff meetings in hopes of avoiding strike next week
Ireland's Aer Lingus airline calls mass staff meetings in hopes of avoiding

Aer Lingus Group PLC, facing the threat of strikes next week, called mass staff meetings Tuesday in hopes of 
persuading employees not to follow their unions' plans for rolling walkouts.
Dermot Mannion, chief executive of the Dublin-based airline, planned to address most of his 3,700-member work 
force in a two-day series of meetings at three airports starting Wednesday.
In a statement, Aer Lingus said Mannion would "underline the importance for the airline that all services operate as 
normal next week. Aer Lingus will not tolerate action that will discommode its customers and sees no legitimate 
reason why services will not operate next week."
Ireland's largest union, representing about half of Aer Lingus employees, criticized Mannion's move as designed to 
undermine union authority.
He "would be far better off dealing with the concerns of the workers and negotiating with their unions, than pursuing 
a zero-sum game in which Aer Lingus only makes money at the expense of its employees," said Michael Halpenny, 
national industrial secretary of the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, or SIPTU.
The union announced Monday night that its members would mount four-hour work stoppages, staggered at different 
times of day from department to department, on Nov. 20 and Nov. 23 at Ireland's three major airports in Dublin, 
Cork and Shannon.
The union said its threat was in reaction to an Aer Lingus move to bind temporary workers to new contracts that 
require longer hours for less pay.
But SIPTU and other unions are in a much bigger, slower-burning confrontation with Mannion over Aer Lingus' 
year-old plan to trim 20 million euro ($29 million) annually from expenses by reforming the entire work force's terms 
and conditions, particularly a heavy bill for overtime pay.
Ireland's Aer Lingus airline calls mass staff meetings in hopes of avoiding strike next week
Unions have refused to accept that plan, and last month, Aer Lingus froze planned pay raises totaling 7.5 percent in 
retaliation.
Aer Lingus has suffered mounting labor tensions since September 2006, when the government floated most of its 
stake in the previously state-owned airline on the British and Irish stock exchanges.
Since then, Aer Lingus' cutthroat budget rival, Ryanair, has mounted an audacious but unsuccessful takeover bid. 
Aer Lingus, seeking to compete with Dublin-based Ryanair and underpin shareholder profits, has repeatedly told 
employees they must endure reforms designed to bring Aer Lingus' cost base closer to the Ryanair model.
Last month, Aer Lingus narrowly defused a showdown with its 480 pilots over its plan to open a new hub in the 
British territory of Northern Ireland. Pilots opposed the move because new pilots were being hired under new British 
contracts rather than existing Irish union-negotiated terms.
Mannion threatened to suspend any pilots who refused to cooperate in recruitment and training of the new pilots, 
effectively grounding the airline, and the pilots relented after winning minor concessions.

increased its dividend. The stock was up $3.60, or 9.8 percent, to $40.40 in afternoon trading.
A group of Goldman Sachs analysts upgraded the European Telecom sector to "Attractive" from "Neutral," naming 
Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom AG as their top picks.
Shares of Deutsche Telekom added 95 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $21.39 in afternoon trading, after earlier setting a 
two-year high of $21.37.
Vimpel-Communications of Russia picked up 93 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $30.71.
Banks also posted strong gains, with shares of HSCB Holdings PLC gaining $2.44, or 2.8 percent, to $88.64 as 
concerns eased about further exposure to debt-related investments in the U.S. eased a bit.
Lower oil prices lifted airline operators, and shares of Ireland's Ryanair Holdings PLC rising $2.05, or 4.8 percent, to 
$44.63.
Shares of Total SA, a French oil company, slipped 25 cents, to $78.58.
Russian wireless provider Mobile Telesystems OJSC missed out on the telecommunications gains, slipping 16 
cents, to $89.84.

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is 'confident' the European Consumer Affairs Commissioner, 
Maglena Kuneva's investigation into airline price advertising would prove its advertising was fair.
The EU consumer affairs watchdog carried out a probe in September and the results are set to be published 
tomorrow. It is believed around half of Europe's airlines, including Ryanair, could be forced to close their websites if 
they fail to iron out problems such as irregularities relating to price indications, contract terms and clarity of 
proposed conditions.
The results do not identify any airlines but the EC is set to publish a list of companies concerned in four months' 
time, sources say.
A commission spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports, but told Thomson Financial News: 'There will be 
no names tomorrow.'
Last month, a Spanish consumer rights group said it had found misleading ticket-related information on seven 
airline web sites -- including Ryanair's.

No-frills airline Ryanair has criticised British Airways for increasing its fuel surcharges to £58. 
In a statement, the airline said, "Even though British Airways and Virgin Atlantic were convicted this year for price 
fixing, British Airways is still increasing its fuel surcharges.
"These fuel surcharge increases are unjust and unfair because British Airways has confirmed that due to its 
hedging, it is buying its fuel for 2007 at USd75 a barrel, almost USD20 below market rates."

Budget carrier Ryanair will roll out the OnAir in-flight mobile connectivity service initially across 25 aircraft during the 
first quarter of next year.
Ryanair is OnAir's full launch customer for the service, which enables passengers to use their mobile phones and 
other devices such as BlackBerrys in flight.
The supplier has been working to secure the necessary approval from national telecom regulators to support the 
start of services for its launch customers, a process that has pushed back the launch of such services into next 
year.
"Our in-flight mobile phone service will be tested on 25 aircraft before the end of March 2008," says Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary. He indicates these are likely to be deployed on aircraft operating out of London 
Stansted.
UK telecom regulators in October launched a six-week consultation on proposals to enable passengers to use their 
mobile devices on board. French telecom regulators have also issued an approval to enable Air France, one of 
three carriers to sign up to OnAir, to carry out its trials.

A strong recovery in the price of Irish shares has been predicted for the remaining weeks of the year by Dolmen 
Stockbrokers.
In its latest Strategy Review, the firm predicts that the ISEQ index will end the year at 8,800, which is nearly 24pc 
above its present level.
It says the Irish market has underperformed significantly since the second quarter as international investors started 
expressing their concern about the outlook for the Irish economy and the property market in particular, by reducing 
their Irish equity exposure. 
 "The unfortunate thing for the Irish market is that with over 42pc of the index weighting in financial stocks and a 
further 19pc accounted for by construction/building related stocks, the ISEQ Index is now a victim of its own 
success," it says. "The rapid price appreciation in these sectors in particular, as investors 'bought' into the Celtic 
Tiger phenomenon, has resulted in substantial gains. "However as growth forecasts are trimmed, and fears of a 
property crash and hard landing circulate amongst overseas investors, these same investors have decided its time 
to take profits and exit the market. "We don't believe that the aggressive sell-off has been justified and in fact has 
been greatly overdone. "The stocks in the sectors referred to above, namely banks and construction all continue to 
perform strongly in their core businesses, have all reaffirmed full-year and forward looking outlooks despite the 
recent uncertainty, and are all trading at levels that lead us to believe the Irish market will recover strongly in the 
last quarter. Dolmen names five Irish shares in its top dozen tips to buy at present. They include two banks - AIB 
and Irish Life and Permanent, and with CRH, Greencore and Ryanair.

Q: It has been suggested the UK government's recent decision to tax flights rather than individual passengers could 
mean more last-minute discounts as airlines desperately try to fill every seat. What impact do you think it will have 
on business travellers? GP, Account Manager, London
A: The decision certainly creates headaches for airline yield managers, whose job it is to ensure the maximum 
return from each seat. But I do not really buy the idea that it will lead to a surge of last-minute price cuts. After all, 
filling every available seat is important to airline revenues with or without a per flight tax. It is more likely carriers will 
divide the tax between passengers based on average load factors (the number of passengers per flight), which is 
bound to result in some perceived unfairness. One possibility is that they may try to reduce "no shows" - 
passengers with fully-flexible tickets who do not turn up for their flights - by offering a greater range of fares with 
penalties for cancellation. The tax, scheduled to take effect on November 1, 2009, will probably deter airlines from 
operating routes on which traffic is relatively light. So travellers needing to get to places away from the mainstream 
may incur greater inconvenience. Its harshest impact will be on business class-only airlines, whose aircraft are fitted 
with fewer seats than conventional carriers.
Q: Why do more low-cost airlines not allow us to pay a bit more to have a seat assigned at check-in? Flying on 
business is stressful enough as it is without the scramble when you board. EasyJet does, but I was once assigned a 
seat on one of their flights and we were then put on a bus to the aircraft - so I still had to put up with the same old 
bunfight. PD, consultant, Somerset United Kingdom
A: One no-frills airline, Ryanair, says the free-for-all saves time and money. Another, bmibaby, claims the opposite. 
Ryanair has tested pre-assignment and is convinced open seating enables it to restrict turn-round time between 
flights to 25 minutes. That results in optimum use of aircraft and holds down costs. Bmibaby says: "We think it 
saves time if there is no rugby scrum on board. We also have a lot of business passengers who like to select a 
particular seat." Ryanair does operate a priority boarding system that allows passengers to be among the first 60 on 
board its 189-seat jets. This costs Pounds 2 per customer with bags to check in but is free to those carrying only 
hand luggage. EasyJet charges between Pounds 2.50 and Pounds 7.50 - it varies between airports - for a service 
called "Speedy Boarding". This buys priority for the first 20 to 30 passengers. The airline says sometimes it is 
necessary to bus passengers to the aircraft, as happened in your case. But it adds if it means you no longer get 
priority you can ask for a refund.
Ask Global Traveller
Q: My company seems to want to track my every movement when I am on the road. They say it is for my own 
security. I just find it intrusive. The risk of anything going seriously wrong on a trip is remote. Do they really need to 
to spend money keeping tabs on me? NC, London
A: Under the UK's new corporate manslaughter legislation, which takes effect next April, your company is even 
more likely to want to know where you are - or at least that you are sticking to its travel policy. The law will make it 
easier to prosecute your employer for gross negligence in failing to exercise a duty of care towards you. This could 
make it more important for travel managers to staff are using approved accommodation and transport. Your 
company may need you to use a pre-booked taxi from the airport in some places, for example. You are not alone in 
finding close tracking intrusive. Perhaps it can be abused but isn't the feeling you are being watched a touch 
paranoid? Are you one of those rare travellers who avoid the temptation to check the Blackberry? Travel managers 
who have had staff involved in disasters say the ability to discover whether staff are safe and inform relatives in a 
very short time is a major plus. One says that whenever he gives a talk on the benefits of tracking he shows a 
television news clip of a family greeting a traveller evacuated from a crisis in Lebanon. The image of their relief, he 
says, is a powerful persuader.

Inmarsat, the FTSE 250-listed satellite communications company, is 'on track' to meet raised full-year consensus 
estimates, its chief executive said on Friday, as it posted a 25% rise in third-quarter pre-tax profit to $33.6 million 
(£16 million) and said it had successfully launched several new services.
One of these will enable airlines to offer internet and mobile telephone connectivity to their passengers, and is 
currently being tested by a number of airlines, including Ryanair (RYA) and British Midlands, Inmarsat's(ISAT) 
CEO, Andrew Sukawaty, said.
Inmarsat, which is among the top 10 holdings of Citywire AA rated Giles Hargreave of Marlborough's Special 
Situation fund, has been in the spotlight recently after an American hedge fund bought into the company and is now 
its largest shareholder, with a 12.38% stake it topped up last week.
The hedge fund is Birmingham, Alabama-based Harbinger Capital Partners, of Harbert Management Corporation, 
run by former Barclays Capital's Philip Falcone. Habert Management oversees more than $20.3 billion in 
investments as of 1 November, according to its website.
Another keen buyer of late has been Lehman Brothers International (Europe). It added to its Inmarsat holding on 
Monday and is now the company's second-largest shareholder with 10.46%.
Lansdowne Partners didn't own a significant stake earlier this year but is now the third largest shareholder with 
10.05%, ahead of BlackRock Investment Management. BlackRock's unchanged 9.31% stake used to qualify it as 
the largest shareholder but now leaves it in fourth position.
Other holders include Legal & General Investment Managers, with 7.7%; KDDI Corporation, with 4.76%; F&C Asset 
Management, with 4.18%; and Prudential, with 3.97%.
Among the funds in which Inmarsat is among the top holdings are Jupiter UK Alpha, F&C UK Mid Cap, Norwich UK 
Growth, Resolution Asset Cartesian UK Opportunities A, and Merrill Lynch UK Income.
At 2:30pm Inmarsat's shares were trading at 468.375p, down 10.625p or 2.2%. Before today they'd risen 25.3% 
since the beginning of the year, and have almost doubled from the 245p they were floated at in June 2005. At the 
stock's current share price the company has a market value of £2.15 billion.
Funds snapping up Immarsat as it promises broadband for planes
From its base in London, Inmarsat operates 10 geostationary satellites that provide mobile phone, fax and data 
communication services to end users around the globe. Its customers are shipowners, broadcasters, national 
governments, airlines, banks and other financial institutions, and include the US Army and most other NATO forces, 
the BBC, CNN, most governments and the UN.
In a report to investors earlier this year, Merrill Lynch said Inmarsat's in-flight mobile telephone service 'could 
represent an additional $100 million a year opportunity for Inmarsat'.
Today, CEO Sukawaty said the company expects to receive 25% of the $2 to $2.50 per minute airline passengers 
will spend making use of the company's in-flight connection service once it's available.
An earlier generation service, Swift 64, currently provides in-flight telephone and internet connectivity via satellite 
connections to people on private and military aircraft.
Other new products at Inmarsat include a new hand-held satellite telephone, known as the IsatPhone, which is 
aimed at business users and individuals who travel or work in areas where normal mobile telephone service doesn't 
exist.

NEWS IN BRIEF
## Fears are growing in Thurles that the town's biggest employer, Erin Foods, is to close with the loss of 100 jobs. 
Staff are expecting to be called to a meeting at which a significant announcement about the plant's future will be 
made. There is little optimism among workers, business leaders and local councillors, and most are now expecting 
that the company will announce its closure. The plant had been experiencing difficulties and had shed jobs during 
the past year. - RTE
## Alleged IRA leader Thomas "Slab" Murphy has appeared in court charged with nine counts of failing to file tax 
returns. He was arrested last night in Dundalk and brought before Ardee District Court this morning. Det Insp Kevin 
Ring, of the Criminal Assets Bureau, told Judge Flann Brennan that following his detention, Mr Murphy was taken to 
hospital after he complained of feeling unwell. A doctor who examined him at the station said he thought the 
accused was feigning injury, the court heard. - Irish Times
 ##The Advertising Standards Authority has upheld a complaint made by the National Women's Council against 
Ryanair. It concerned an ad in the national newspapers when children were returning to school at the end of 
August. It depicted a teenage girl, dressed inappropriately and posing in a sexually-provocative way.The Women's 
Council complained that the advert was inappropriate, irresponsible and distasteful, displaying an obvious 
disrespect for young girls and women. - Irish Independent

Shares on the Dublin market was down nearly 2 percent this morning as soaring oil prices and a weak dollar 
continue to cause investors anxiety. 
At 10.30am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 108.16 points at 7080.14
Once again the Irish equity market seriously underperformed today, with E9 billion wiped off the value of Irish 
shares in the last five days. The index is now almost 30pc off its peak and 5pc below the low point of mid-
September, according to Davy Research.
 However, oil prices retreated from record peaks in Asian trade, falling back under USD96 a barrel after US crude 
reserves were reduced by a smaller-than-expected margin. But the dollar fell back again towards record lows 
against the euro as sentiment towards the currency remained extremely negative. Financial shares were all down. 
Bank of Ireland fell 46c to 10.15 and AIB slipped 62c to 14.15. Anglo Irish Bank dropped 65c to 9.95 and Irish Life 
and Permanent was down 42c to 13.28. Construction shares fared little better. CRH slipped 76c to 23.54 and 
Kingspan fell 36c to 36c to 14.00. Grafton was down 23c to 6.67 and McInerney dropped 4c to 1.36. Elsewhere, 
bookmaker Paddy Power fell 60c to 26.75 despite Playtech, Paddy Power's poker software provider, issuing a 
bullish Q3 trading update suggesting Power's poker business could be continuing to perform very well Other 
notable movers include FBD down 25c to 21.85, Ryanair down 10c to 5.00 and Smurfit Kappa down 18c to 13.01. 
Ryanair ended its share buyback on Wednesday when it bought 1.055m shares and has now spent the promised 
E300 million on acquiring and cancelling shares (at an average price close to E5). This will help lift EPS in future 
years, without incurring any material balance sheet penalties, according to Goodbody Research. Shares at Icon 
were up E1.50 to 40.50 after its peer clinical development organisation PRA International reporting top-line 
numbers for Q3, with revenues up 18oc. Earnings per share was down on last year, mainly due to lower PBIT 
margins, but at 26c it came in some 2c ahead of market expectations. Also, shares at Ormonde Mining were 
unchanged at 0.18 after the company said that further drilling at Ormonde's 100pc owned La Zarza project in Spain

Elan fell 45c to 15.6o on news that the first round bids for Biogen Idec, Elan's partner in the development and 
commercialisation of Tysabri, are due next week. Carl Icahn has offered USD23 billion for Biogen, with other front 
runners touted to be the usual large cap pharma suspects (e.g. Pfizer, Merck and J and J), according to Ian Hunter, 
analyst at Goodbody Research. Meanwhile, DCC is scheduled to publish its H108 results, for the six months ending 
September, next Monday. Goodbody Research said it is forecasting revenues of E1,886 million (up 5pc year-on-
year), EBITDA of E72 million (up 6pc year-on-year), operating profit of E49.5 million (up 10pc from E45.2 million in 
H107) and adjusted EPS of 47c (up 6pc year-on-year), with organic growth being the key driver. Shares at DCC 
were down 16c to 19.59 in morning trading.

BT Ireland grew its revenues by 5.7pc to 549m euro in its first half to the end of September, it announced today.
It said that "new wave revenue", involving broadband, networked IT and mobility services, grew by 22pc year on 
year and now accounted for 30 per cent of total revenue.
The results cover the company's operations across the whole of the island of Ireland.
 It said that broadband growth remained the core element in the company's strategy. Its total number of retail 
broadband connections rose by 60pc in the Republic year-on-year to nearly 74,000, and by 41 per cent year on 
year in Northern Ireland to more than 139,000. The wholesale division also continued to grow and more than 
290,000 homes and business sites across Northern Ireland are using broadband services provided over the BT 
network. Revenues in the business and government sectors were boosted by continued strong demand for 
networked IT services. Key wins secured in the half year include Airtricity, Ascon Contractors, Bank of Ireland, BDO 
Simpson Xavier, Northern Ireland Civil Service, PFPC International, SWS Business Process Outsourcing Ltd and 
Ryanair. BT Ireland also provided the broadcast network service for the launch of the first high definition TV 
coverage of an Irish sporting event, in conjunction with RTE, TV3, TG4 and the Department of Communications, 
Energy and Natural Resources. The company says its continued roll out of its "next generation" network continued 
to gather pace. Over the half year, it says, it upgraded a significant part of its all island fibre optic network to provide 
the transport infrastructure for its converged services. It had introduced broadband services of speeds up to 8Mbps 
via local loop unbundling in 14 areas in Cork, Dublin, Kildare and Limerick. BT Openzone, its public wireless 
broadband service, showed year on year usage growth of 125 per cent as expansion continued into airports, hotels, 
and other prime locations. The half year had also seen Belfast added to the BT Wireless Cities programme. Its 
"next generation" television service BT Vision was rolled out in Northern Ireland with the support of a major 
marketing campaign. Chris Clark, Chief Executive Officer, BT Ireland said, "Our focus on growing new wave 
BT Ireland revenue grows 5.7pc in H1
business while robustly defending traditional revenues has yielded a solid set of results. Innovation underpins this 
growth, and in a challenging and competitive market, has helped us differentiate what we bring to customers." BT 
Ireland directly employs more than 3,000 on the island and is headquartered in Belfast and Dublin.

Shares on the Dublin market shed close to another 2bn euro in value today as soaring oil prices and a weak dollar 
continued to cause investors anxiety. 
The market was nearly 200 points lower early on and, although it recovered somewhat later in the day, it was still

point of mid-September. With the dollar still hovering close to record lows against the euro, and another big US 
financial house - Morgan Stanley - today admitting USD 3.7bn of sub prime losses, the gloomy mood in Dublin did 
its worst. Financial shares were mostly down down. Bank of Ireland fell 21c to 1040 and AIB slipped 17c to 1460.

An index tracking European stocks traded on U.S. exchanges sank Wednesday, with shares of airlines falling on 
concerns over the price of oil, which reached record highs during the session.
The Bank of New York Europe ADR index gave up 2.54 points to 195.53 in afternoon trading. ADRs, or American 
Depositary Receipts, are securities that allow U.S. investors to trade stocks of companies based overseas.
The price of oil rose as high as $98.72, but later retreated after a government report showed oil declines fell less 
than expected.
Shares of Irish air carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC skidded $2.53, or 5.4 percent, to $44.78.
Air France KLM declined $1.33, or 3.8 percent, to $33.88, and set a 52-week low of $33.70.
Shares of CNH Global NV, a Dutch agricultural and construction equipment maker, gave up $3.83, or 5.8 percent, 
to $62.31.
Shares of French telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent slipped 38 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $8.70.
On the winning side, shares of Total SA of France rose $2.86, or 3.5 percent, to $83.55. The oil company reported 
its third-quarter results Wednesday, and said greater production and higher oil prices led to a 29 percent increase in 
profit. Sales grew 3 percent.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC gained 42 cents to $85.20.
Nokia Corp., based in Finland, said it will work with Vodafone Group PLC of Britain to improve Internet access and 
other services, giving customers access to the music services of both companies. Shares of Nokia, a mobile phone

Vueling Airlines SA largest shareholder Jose Manuel Lara has called on the no-frills carrier´s board to recognise the 
need to change the way the airline is managed ahead of an EGM on Nov 26.
Vueling chairwoman Barbara Cassani, or other board members, 'may have realized that the carrier needs a 
change,' giving hope of a dispute-free EGM, El Confidencial quoted him as saying.
Management had done well previously, 'but since the entry (into the Spanish market) of new competitors such as 
Ryanair and Clickair, they have made mistakes. It´s not acceptable to issue so many profit warnings,' he said.
At the beginning of October, Vueling cut its full-year guidance for the second time.
Vueling and Grupo Planeta's Inversiones Hemisferio, which Lara chairs, have been embroiled in a dispute over 
management strategy since Planeta representatives, including Lara, resigned from the carrier's board in October.
Recently, Hemisferio threatened legal action against board members. Vueling, in response, invited the group to 
raise its stake or even acquire the company.
Lara holds 26.8 pct of Vueling.
Separately, Lara confirmed that Miguel Zorita and Javier de Salas had invited him to enter the 'Spanish offer' for 
Iberia.
He added that he is focusing on Vueling for the moment.

There was E3 billion wiped off the value of Irish shares today as oil surged towards near USD100 a barrel and as 
the dollar plunged to new lows against the euro.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 222.86 points at 7188.30
Oil broke new ground today as it continued its climb towards USD100, setting record highs in both London and New 
York as news that some North Sea production will be lost this week, raising supply fears already heightened by 
expectations for a further drop in US inventories. 
 This hit airline shares such as Ryanair, which plunged 28c to 5.20 and Aer Lingus, down 4c to 2.27. Meanwhile, 
the euro hit fresh record highs of USD1.4729 against the dollar as the US unit's relentless falls continued, taking 
major currencies surging past levels which only a few months ago would have seemed astonishing. The trigger 
came from China, where a key official warned that the Asian giant may well diversify its reserves away from the 
dollar. Financial shares took a beating. Bank of Ireland fell 36c to 10.74 and AIB slipped 49c to 14.84. Anglo Irish 
Bank was down 55c to 10.40 and Irish Life and Permanent dropped 26c to 13.57. The construction sector fared little 
better. CRH fell 80c to 24.30 and Grafton was down 25c to 6.95. Kingspan slipped 80c to 14.55 and McInerney 
dropped 4c to 1.39. Robert Eason, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers says Grafton's recent share buyback to date 
would add almost 1c to full year 2008 earnings. On Tuesday, Grafton announced that it had bought back a further 
600,000 shares at an average price of E7.213 per share. Since the first purchase of shares in the middle of 
September, the company has bought back almost 3.8m shares (c.1.6pc of the outstanding shares) at a total cost of 
almost E30 million, which would represent an average price of c.E7.85 per share. "We estimate that in a full year 
this would add almost 1c to earnings and, if the full 10pc share buy-back authorisation was utilised, a further 4c 
could potentially be added to earnings in a full year. As we have noted before, this would still leave scope for the 
company to undertake c.E350 million in acquisitions over the next two years, adding 7c to earnings," he said. 
Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power climbed 59c to 27.59 and Irish Continental Group down E1.75 to 24.00 Other 
ISEQ closes day 3 percent lower
notable movers include FBD down 95c to 22.55, Kerry Group down 29c to 21.27 and Tullow Oil down 12c to 9.41. 
Also, shares at DCC were down 8c to 19.52 despite its peer European waste management group Shanks interim 
results showing strength in the recycling sector. Within the UK operations, Shanks said that the logistical and 
recycling operation, located in the central belt of Scotland, had shown "substantial increases" in trading profits, as 
the economies from being the largest operator in the area feed through. DCC's environmental division, which has 
an operating base in central Scotland, is the smallest in the group, accounting for approximately 2pc of group 
revenues and 7pc of operating profit. "DCC has targeted the environmental division as an "area of primary focus" 
for further bolt-on deals and as we believe that DCC is in the process of ramping up its acquisition spend, it is likely 
that the Environmental businesses will become a more significant part of the wider group," according to Dan 
Cavanagh, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers.

 "Boeing are very keen at the moment now to firm up an order book into and beyond 2012," Mr O'Leary tells the

taking more aircraft beyond 2012. "It's a first round of discussion, so, we're making unreasonable demands and 
Boeing are giving us some reasonable rejections. "But the process has started, which I think is better than not

The figure is greater than the 500 mln stg extra equity funding that Delta had asked its backer, the Qatari

UK Sept manufacturing output falls sharply, may weigh on Q3 GDP
LONDON (Thomson Financial) - UK manufacturing output fell sharply in September, dragged down by widespread 
falls, most notably in electrical and optical equipment, official figures today showed.
THOMSON FINANCIAL NEWS TOP STORIES UK 0805 GMT
Data from the office for National Statistics showed manufacturing output, which makes up about 15 pct of the UK 
economy, fell 0.6 pct in September from August. The drop was the steepest since February this year. It reverses 
August's 0.4 pct rise and misses expectations for output to be unchanged month-on-month.

companies which were merged into Norwich Union and its subsidiaries.

UK's Darling seeks to ease concerns after Citigroup boss quits
LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling sought to ease concerns that the 
turmoil in the US banking sector threatens the outlook for the UK economy.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Darling insisted that the prospects for the world economy, as well 
as the UK's, remain relatively healthy despite a moderation in the rate of growth.
Delta currently sitting on a loss of about 570 mln stg on Sainsbury stake
LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Delta (Two) Ltd is sitting on a loss of about 570 mln stg from its 25 pct stake in J 
Sainsbury PLC, at the current share price, after pulling out of its proposed 10.6 bln stg takeover of the supermarket 
retailer earlier this morning.
The figure is greater than the 500 mln stg extra equity funding that Delta had asked its backer, the Qatari 
Investment Authority (QIA), to put into the deal -- a request that was apparently turned down.

Share prices were higher in thin mid-session trade but off intraday highs, broadly in line with other European 
markets and led by Gas Natural and Gamesa.
At 12.04 pm, the IBEX-35 index was up 88.50 points at 15,911.90, after trading in a range of 15,892-15,959.
Equities opened higher, extending yesterday's late rally after Wall Street came off initial lows, though gains lost 
some momentum through the morning as the IBEX-35 index pulled back from the psychologically key 16,000 mark.
Gas Natural added 0.44 eur to 41.79, off a high of 42.50, after the group announced a bullish guidance for the 
2008-2012 period and reported nine-month to September earnings figures that were at the high end of forecasts.
Enagas led losers, falling 0.11 to 19.67, amid profit taking after recent outperformance and after Gas Natural said it 
has no plans to sell its stake in the company.
Union Fenosa fell 0.29 to 46.84 after selling 2 pct of Red Electrica de Espana (REE) at 38.80 eur per share. REE 
rose 0.07 to 39.07.
Amongst other energy issues, Gamesa rose 1.24 or 3.56 pct to 36.09, boosted by forecast-beating third quarter 
results from Danish peer Vestas Wind Systems.
Sogecable added 0.39 to 28.32, after a Spanish court ruled that Mediapro must pay the broadcaster's Audiovisual 
Sports unit for the rights to broadcast football league matches.
'This is the second court ruling in Sogecable's favour in the last few weeks and supports AVS' claim that it holds the 
exclusive rights to distribute the football matches' an analyst at a leading Portuguese bank said.
Sabadell was unchanged at 6.99, after the bank's Investor Day revealed aims for a return on equity of 20.5 pct, 
annual investment growth of 12 pct and a 500 mln eur rise in profits from ordinary activities by the same date.
Other banks mostly outperformed, with Santander adding 0.02 to 14.55 and BBVA rising 0.05 to 17.25.
Amongst small and medium caps, Vueling rose 0.15 to 16.10, after a solid set of traffic figures after yesterday's 
close and strong guidance from low-cost peer Ryanair.
Madrid shares higher in mid-session trade; Gas Natural up, Enagas down
Fadesa fell 1.20 or 4.82 pct to 23.70, after Cheuvreux downgraded it to 'underperform' from 'outperform' and also 
sharply cut the property company's estimates.

British Airways' plan to set up a wholly owned subsidiary operating Boeing 757s out of Europe's major hubs to the 
US East Coast looks set to put a cat among the pigeons. 
Operators registered in one European Union country setting up satellite operations all over Europe for intra-
European operations is not new. The biggest practitioners are EasyJet and Ryanair. But BA's determination to be in 
the vanguard of those who take advantage of the new EU/US agreement is going to be watched with interest by 
competing carriers, departments of transport, and trades unions - particularly pilot associations.
BA has to bust out of its Heathrow straitjacket or see its potential for growth limited, so "Project Lauren", as the 
venture is coded, is likely to be the first of several moves BA makes in Europe. It sounds like an idea from Ryanair 
boss Michael O'Leary that Flight International revealed in April, but full-service, not low-cost.
Known as a successful legacy carrier with a talent for selling premium seats, especially across the "Pond", BA is 
bound to use this venture as an opportunity to break some old moulds. But which ones? That's what BA and the 
British Air Line Pilots Association are discussing. In the brave new world into which BA and BALPA are venturing, 
there will be a high price to pay for failure to agree - for both sides. If BALPA pushes its luck too far it could become 
a legacy association.

Ryanair profits soar 24% in first half

Ryanair, the leading European low-cost airline, increased its profits sharply in the first six months of the year and 
raised its forecast for full-year profits.
The Irish carrier said it would launch a trial of its in-flight mobile phone service on 25 aircraft by the end of March, 
allowing passengers to receive and make phone calls and text messages on their own mobiles or BlackBerrys.
The airline is aiming to be the first carrier in Europe to launch a mobile phone service across its entire fleet.
Ryanair said yesterday its net profits in the first six months to the end of September had risen by 24 per cent from 
Euros 329m to Euros 408m (Dollars 590m), while turnover increased by 24 per cent from Euros 1.3bn to Euros 
1.6bn.
Passenger numbers rose by 20 per cent to 26.6m, while the average fare level fell by 1 per cent. The group 
remained the world's most profitable airline with a net profit margin of 26 per cent in the first six months.
Ryanair said its performance was supported by a strong increase in ancillary revenues, including commission 
earnings from hotel, car rental and travel insurance bookings and checked-in baggage charges, which rose in total 
by 54 per cent to Euros 252m.
Ancillary revenues accounted for 16 per cent of turnover, and the airline has set a target of increasing this to 20 per 
cent.
The airline has also introduced a Pounds 2/Euros 3 charge for passengers choosing to use airport check-in desk 
facilities in order to encourage the use of online check-in, as a new step to cut costs and increase ancillary 
revenues.
Ryanair said it had implemented its 20 per cent reduction in the number of aircraft it was operating at London 
Stansted airport, the airline's biggest operating base in Europe, during the winter months.
Ryanair profits soar 24% in first half
The cut in capacity would bring "more stability" to fare levels, reduce operating costs and eliminate losses on 
unprofitable winter routes at the airport.
It revised upwards its forecast for full-year profits to an increase of 17.5 per cent to Euros 470m, up from the 
previous guidance of Euros 440m.
The big increase in profits in the first half has been achieved in spite of higher oil prices and a doubling of airport 
charges at London Stansted.
Ryanair repeated its call for BAA's monopoly ownership of London's three biggest airports, Heathrow, Gatwick and 
Stansted, to be broken up.
The BAA monopoly is under investigation by the UK Competition Commission.
The airline is opening four new operating bases during the winter months at Valencia, Alicante, Bristol and Belfast 
City, and expects to announce one or two more in coming weeks for launch next summer.

Troubled financial stocks continued their downhill slalom yesterday, dragging European indices lower for a third 
consecutive session, while Franco-German aerospace group EADS fell after it announced production delays on a 
military aircraft would eat into profits.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 0.7 per cent to 1,549.22, mainly because confidence in the financial sector continued to 
be hurt by the fall-out from the credit market turmoil.
Chuck Prince quit as chairman and chief executive of Citigroup on Sunday night as the company revealed it was 
facing between Dollars 8bn and Dollars 11bn of further losses on its holdings of subprime-related securities.
The news weighed on European financials. Societe Generale
dropped 2.1 per cent to Euros 106.34. Bear Stearns cut its recommendation on France's second biggest bank to 
"peer perform" from "outperform" as it lowered 2008 earnings estimates for French banks by 10 per cent.
Although banks had already written down billions of dollars in assets linked to US subprime mortgage lending, 
deteriorating US housing market fundamentals continued to put pressure on capital markets as investors became 
risk averse, the brokerage said.
"We believe the outlook for (French banks') derivatives, structured finance and proprietary trading businesses has 
deteriorated," it added.
BNP Paribas
slid 1.7 per cent to Euros 70.32, while Natixis slumped 1.5 per cent to Euros 13.87, while Credit Agr icole edged 
down 0.8 per cent to Euros 25.66 after both Lehman and Bear Stearns said the bank would continue to outperform 
its French peers.
In Germany, Deutsche Postbank
EADS hit by delays to military aircraft
tumbled 4.8 per cent to Euros 44.9 and Deutsche Bank
fell 2.1 per cent to Euros 85.16.
Swiss bank UBS
slid 3.7 per cent to SFr54.6 while rival Credit Suisse softened 1.7 per cent to SFr71.25.
Volatile Irish banks also took a pummelling, with Bank of Ireland down 2.8 per cent to Euros 11.49 and Anglo Irish 
Bank falling 4.5 per cent to Euros 10.63.
European insurers followed their banking peers lower with Swiss Re sliding 2.1 per cent to SFr101.8 and France's 
Axa down 1.7 per cent to Euros 29.52. Germany's Munich Re closed 1.8 per cent lower at Euros 128.23 in spite of 
it saying it could exceed its earnings forecast for the full year.
EADS, Europe's leading aerospace and defence group, retreated 3.8 per cent to Euros 22.02 after warning that 
delays of up to 12 months on the development of the A400M military transport aircraft would cut profits by Euros 
1.2bn-Euros 1.4bn in the third quarter.
Shares in Ireland's Ryanair fell by a sharp 4 per cent to Euros 5.52 after it gave an update on passenger numbers, 
prompting Citigroup to keep its "buy" rating but note that the stock's valuation looked stretched.
However, the brokerage added that Ryanair would suffer less from rising fuel costs than its competitors further up 
the price range.
Talk that Siemens would post strong fourth-quarter numbers, and a flight to traditional manufacturing stocks in the 
face of the credit turmoil drove the German technical group up 1.1 per cent to Euros 93.95, dealers said.
Chemicals group Bayer also gained 0.6 per cent to Euros 57.01 on expectation it would post strong third-quarter 
numbers in spite of announcing that it had halted global sales of its anti-bleeding drug Trasylol.
Swedish engineering stocks Sandvik and Atlas Copco rose off their lows after reporting poor third-quarter numbers 
last month, rebounding 3 per cent to SKr119.25 and 2.4 per cent to SKr105 respectively.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, achieved a sharp increase in interim profits and has raised its forecast 
for the full-year.
The Irish carrier said it would launch a trial of its inflight mobile phone service on 25 aircraft by the end of March, 
enabling incoming and outgoing calls and text messages for passengers.
The airline is aiming to be the first carrier in Europe to launch a mobile phone service across its entire fleet.
Ryanair has also introduced a Pounds 2/Euros 3 charge for passengers choosing to use its airport check-in desk 
facilities in order to encourage greater use of online check-in as a new step to cut costs and increase revenues.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the airline planned to add self-service kiosks at airports and would 
"aggressively" increase charges for the use of check-in desks. About 9 per cent of passengers are using online 
check-in and Ryanair is seeking to raise this share to about 40 per cent over the next two years.
Net profits in the six months to the end of September rose 24 per cent from Euros 329m to Euros 408m (Pounds 
283m), as turnover increased 24 per cent from Euros 1.3bn to Euros 1.6bn. Pre-tax profits were Euros 460m, up 
from Euros 372m.
Passenger numbers rose 20 per cent to 26.6m, while the average fare level declined by 1 per cent to Euros 49.
The group remained the world's most profitable airline with a net profit margin of 26 per cent. The big increase in

Ryanair takes off and boosts forecasts
It revised upwards its forecast for full-year profits to an increase of 17.5 per cent to Euros 470m, up from the 
previous guidance of Euros 440m. Ryanair said the fall in average fares during the winter was expected to be at the 
lower end of its previous forecast of a decline of 5 to 10 per cent.
The group said it had spent Euros 267m during the past two months buying back 53.5m shares, representing about 
3.5 per cent of its issued capital.
Ryanair repeated its call for BAA's monopoly ownership of London's three biggest airports to be broken up. The 
monopoly is under investigation by the Competition Commission.
Mr O'Leary said the Civil Aviation Authority, the economic regulator for BAA's London airports, had "repeatedly 
failed to effectively regulate this monopoly which is why it continues to provide third-world service at extortionate 
prices".
Shares in Ryanair closed down 24.5 cents, or more than 4 per cent, at Euros 5.51.

Ryanair Holdings PLC raised its full-year forecast Monday as Europe's leading no-frills airline said its second-
quarter profit rose 26 percent.
Net profit came to €268.7 million in the July-September quarter, Ryanair said, up from €213.4 million a year earlier 
and roughly in line with analysts' expectations.
The growth reflected the rollout of new routes and bases, and Ryanair's increasing focus on making extra money 
from add-on charges and side businesses.
Total revenue rose 25 percent to €861.3 million (US$1.25 billion). Of that, ticket sales rose 20.6 percent to €726 
million (US$1.05 billion), while income from "ancillary" activities including commissions on hotel and rental-car 
bookings; on-board shopping, food and bingo; and extra charges for baggage and check-in rose 54 percent to 
€135.3 million (US$196 million).
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair expected to report a 17.5 percent gain in full-year net profits to €470 
million (US$680 million), up from his previous forecast of €440 million.
O'Leary said Ryanair was enjoying stronger winter bookings than expected. And he said expenses would be kept in 
check with a fuel-hedging deal that has secured the airline's fuel needs through the end of the fiscal year at US$65 
(€45) a barrel compared to current levels near US$95 (€66).
Because of this, O'Leary told analysts in a conference call, "frankly, at the moment, we would welcome higher fuel 
prices."
He said Ryanair's competitors, most of which add fuel surcharges to the cost of tickets, would come under pressure 
to raise prices further because their fuel costs were not hedged as aggressively. Continued increases in oil prices 
"will be good for our growth and it will be good for our yields," O'Leary said.
However, Ryanair shares fell 4 percent to €5.52 (US$7.98) on the Irish Stock Exchange, reflecting broader declines 
in European trading.
Ryanair posts 26 percent gain in 2nd-quarter profit, raises full-year forecast 
Ryanair, founded in 1985, operates 563 routes from 23 bases across 26 countries.

An index tracking Europe-based stocks traded on U.S. exchanges declined Monday, with shares of Irish airline 
Ryanair Holdings PLC dropping in spite of a stronger fiscal second quarter, and a higher full-year forecast.
The Bank of New York Europe ADR index lost 1.95, to 195.12. ADRs, or American Depositary Receipts, are 
securities that allow U.S. investors to trade stocks based overseas.
Ryanair said it would keep expenses down with a deal that will secure 90 percent of its oil through the end of the 
year, at a cost of $65 per barrel. But JPMorgan analyst Chris Avery said the agreement does not cover Ryanair's oil 
needs next year, which could stunt its profit growth.
Shares fell $2.87, or 5.9 percent, to $46.08.
Shares of Rio Tinto PLC, a British mining company, gave up $19.27, or 5.2 percent, to $351.46, as some metals 
prices fell and most mining stocks declined.
British mining company BHP Billiton PLC sank $3.55, or 4.8 percent, to $71.04.
Financial stocks continued to drop, with shares of Bank of Ireland Group sliding $2.58, or 3.7 percent, to $67.55, 
and Allied Irish Banks PLC losing $1.65, or 3.5 percent, to $46.05.
On the positive side, shares of British mobile phone company Vodafone Group PLC added 92 cents, or 2.4 percent,

Shares of Dutch chip maker STMicroelectronics NV picked up 16 cents, to $17.16.

Ryanair Holdings H1 pretax 459.5 mln eur vs 372.2 mln; ups FY guidance
LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Low cost airline Ryanair Holdings posted pretax profits of 459.5 mln eur for the six 
months to Sept 30, against 372.2 mln for the same period in 2006, after passenger numbers grew by 20 pct to 26.6 
mln.
Interim profits after tax increased 24 pct to 407.6 mln eur and revenues also increased by 24 pct to 1.55 bln eur, it 
said, although yields fell by 1 pct. Unit costs increased by 5 pct, mainly due to higher fuel, staff, and airport costs, it 
said.
Delta terminates offer talks with Sainsbury

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's leading no-frills airline, on Monday raised its full-year forecast and posted a 26-
percent jump in second-quarter profit, helped partly by new routes.
Net profit totaled 268.7 million euros in the July-September quarter, up from 213.4 million euros a year earlier, 
Ryanair said. That was roughly in line with Wall Street expectations.
The growth reflected the rollout of new routes and bases, and Ryanair's increasing focus on making extra money 
from add-on charges and side businesses.
Total revenue rose 25 percent to 861.3 million euros ($1.25 billion). Of that, ticket sales rose 20.6 percent to 726 
million euros ($1.05 billion).
Meanwhile, income from "ancillary" activities including commissions on hotel and rental-car bookings; on-board 
shopping, food and bingo; and extra charges for baggage and check-in rose 54 percent to 135.3 million euros 
($196 million).
Looking ahead, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair expected to report a 17.5 percent gain in full-year net 
profits to 470 million euros ($680 million), up from his previous forecast of 440 million euros.
O'Leary said Ryanair was enjoying stronger winter bookings than expected. And he added that expenses would be 
kept in check with a fuel-hedging deal that has secured 90 percent of the airline's fuel needs through the end of the 
fiscal year at $65 (45 euros) a barrel compared with current levels near $95 (66 euros). The remaining 10 percent 
was hedged at approximately $68 (47 euros), he said.
Because of this, O'Leary told analysts in a conference call: "Frankly, at the moment, we would welcome higher fuel 
prices."
He said Ryanair's competitors, most of which add fuel surcharges to the cost of tickets, would come under pressure 
to raise prices further because their fuel costs were not hedged as aggressively. Continued increases in oil prices 
"will be good for our growth and it will be good for our yields," O'Leary said.
Ryanair posts 26-percent gain in 2Q profit, raises full-year forecast
O'Leary said Ryanair also was on track to launch a trial cell phone service on about 25 aircraft by the spring of 
2008. The service would allow passengers to make and receive calls, email and send text for a fee. The service 
would use an on-board network connection that does not interfere with the aircraft's electronics.
Ryanair shares fell 4 percent to 5.54 euros ($7.98) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Analysts said the decline in shares 
partly reflected investor concerns that Ryanair remained unhedged against high fuel costs from April 2008 onward.
Ryanair, founded in 1985, operates 563 routes from 23 bases across 26 countries.

Virgin Media says BSkyB proposals over ITV stake 'don't go far enough' - report
LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Virgin Media said proposals by BSkyB to resolve concerns over its stake in ITV by 
offering to cede voting rights over a portion of its 17.9 pct holding do not go far enough, the Daily Telegraph 
reported.
The satellite company yesterday offered to cede voting rights over a portion of its holding to address concerns 
raised by the Competition Commission, but Virgin Media insists that Sky should offload the entire stake, the paper 
said.

ROUNDUP Ryanair lifts FY forecast on higher H1; better yield outlook
ROUNDUP Ryanair lifts FY forecast on higher H1; better yield outlook

Ryanair, the Dublin-based low-cost carrier, increased its full-year net profit forecast to 470 mln eur, from 440 mln 
eur, after it reported a 24 pct rise in net profits for the first half and said that the drop in yields this winter would not 
be as steep as previously expected.
Shares in the company retreated, however, as it warned that third-quarter net profits would be 'significantly lower' 
than the same period last year, reflecting lower ticket prices and a one-off contribution from the termination of its 
hotel partners last year.
The airline reported net profits of 407.6 mln eur for the six months to Sept 30, against 329.1 mln for the same period 
in 2006, on revenues up 24 pct to 1.55 bln eur. Pretax profits came in at 459.5 mln eur against 372.2 mln.
'We are very pleased with the first six months,' finance director Howard Millar told Thomson Financial News in a 
telephone interview. 'Passenger volumes are up 20 pct and profits are up 24 pct.'
The average ticket price fell 1 pct to 49 eur, in line with predictions that fares would be flat, chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said at a press conference in London.
But he said tickets prices for the next two quarters, guided by good visibility for the third quarter and some 
indications that the fourth quarter, in which Easter falls, would decline by about 5 pct, which is towards the lower 
end of the 5-10 pct fall previously signalled.
Some of the pricing power was down to the carrier taking seven aircraft out of service at Stansted in response to 
Grupo Ferrovial SA unit BAA's doubling of airport charges, making some routes unprofitable in winter, O'Leary said.
'The biggest increase in costs has been in airport charges,' he said. 'Higher airport charges are not justified, 
certainly not at Stansted.'
O'Leary was bullish on the other major cost increase facing the airline -- the higher price of fuel -- because fuel 
surcharges, which are shunned by Ryanair, drive customers to the low-cost carrier.
Ryanair is 90 pct hedged at 65 usd a barrel until the end of the financial year in March, and is also 10 pct hedged 
for the third quarter next year, but the group will probably go into next summer un-hedged, he said.
ROUNDUP Ryanair lifts FY forecast on higher H1; better yield outlook
'We welcome higher fuel charges for the next 12 months,' he said. 'Fuel surcharges result in a more benign yield 
environment. As long as we maintain the price differential we grow more strongly.'
O'Leary said despite higher fuel and airport costs, unit costs increase came in at 5 pct, lower than the company's 7 
pct target.
Strong growth in ancillary revenues, up 54 pct to 252 mln eur, contributed to a 3 pct increase in total revenue per 
passenger, Millar said.
Ancillary revenues grew by 54 pct to 252 mln eur, and now account for just over 16 pct of total revenues, he said.
The airline's decision to introduce charging for checking in at the airport had also been an 'amazing success', he 
added. 'We have changed customer behaviour very quickly, our web check-in numbers have doubled.'
Ryanair's new routes and bases performed well over the summer, O'Leary said, and this winter the airline will open 
130 new routes across Europe and new bases at Alicante and Valencia in Spain, Belfast City in Northern Ireland 
and Bristol in the UK.
A further one or two new bases for next summer will be announced in the coming weeks, he said, adding that he 
would be 'very surprised' if the carrier does not have a base in Eastern Europe by the end of next year.
The airline continued its share buyback programme by buying 53.5 mln shares at a cost of 267 mln eur over the last 
two months, representing about 3.5 pct of the company's share capital, finance director Millar said. 'We have 33 mln 
eur to go to complete the programme,' he said.
Ryanair's latest traffic figures, released this morning, showed an increase in both passenger numbers and load 
factor for October.
It carried 4.52 mln passengers in October, a rise of 21 pct from 3.73 mln in the same month last year, while the load 
factor -- a measure of how full its planes were -- rose to 85 pct from 83 pct.
In reaction to the interim numbers, Citigroup said the second-quarter results, including operating profit of 304 mln 
eur, were better than expected but in line with consensus.
It said higher fuel costs were a concern, but Ryanair was better placed than its competitors, because it is 90 pct 
hedged at 65 usd a barrel until March 2008, but very little after that. However, this is partly offset by the weak dollar 
and a better yield environment, Citigroup said.
Setting its 6.15 eur price target, the broker noted that the share price is on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 19.2 
times against a range of 15-25 historically.
Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank kept a 'buy' on Ryanair, saying it had already upgraded ahead of the company's 
guidance.
The broker noted that although first-half net income of 408 mln eur was ahead of consensus, yields, including bag 
handling revenues, fell by 0.6 pct in the second quarter, slightly less than its view.
The broker noted that Ryanair raised its guidance for full-year net income, citing winter yields as being better than 
previously forecast.
But while it envisages upgrades of 2-3 pct on consensus figures, the broker said it will leave its forecasts for 
Ryanair unchanged.
The company's shares had shed 0.27 eur, or 4.7 pct, to 5.48 eur at 4.08 pm.

ISEQ closes lower on Citigroup backlash
ISEQ closes lower on Citigroup backlash

Highlight: Shares in the Dublin market closed significantly lower today.
Body
Shares in the Dublin market closed significantly lower today as banks suffered the aftermath of a shake- up at 
banking giant Citigroup. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 173.15 points 7461.83
The resignation of Chuck Prince from Citigroup over the weekend, accompanied by the inability to assure investors 
that a potential USD11 billion write-down for sub-prime mortgages would not increase, only made matters worse in 
the Irish financial sector. 
 In the financial sector, Bank of Ireland was down 42c at 11.40 and AIB dropped 50c to 15.85. Anglo Irish Bank fell 
33c to 10.80 and Irish Life and Permanent slipped 58c to 13.50. Shares in the construction sector were mixed. CRH 
fell 37c to 24.88 while Grafton rose 5c to 7.48. Kingspan fell 24c to 15.57 and McInerney dropped 8c to 1.40. 
Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power dropped 55c at 27.90 while no-frills airline Ryanair slumped 27c to 5.48 after 
despite it posting a 23pc rise in pretax profits to 459.5 million euro for the six months to September 30. Other 
notable movers include FBD down 25c to 23.90, Elan down 25c to 15.85 and Icon down E2 to 39.00. Shares at 
media group UTV were down 5c to 5.10 after speculation that Communicorp is likely to sell FM104 in an effort to 
satisfy the Competition Authority's concerns about its takeover of EMAP's Irish radio assets. This would leave 
Communicorp with 98FM and Spin103.8 broadcasting in the Dublin region as well as national stations, Newstalk 
and Today FM. According to Conor Duffy, analyst at Davy Research, "if FM104 is put up for sale, it is likely to be of 
interest to UTV, which was a failed bidder for EMAP's Irish radio assets. The company is still keen to expand its 
radio operations both here and in the UK. Agreement between Communicorp and the Competition Authority is likely 
within the week." Meanwhile, shares at Trinity Biotech dropped 12c to 1.46. Davy Research said they are reducing 
their full year 2007 and 2008 forecasts for the company following a disappointing set of Q3 results on October 25th 
and subsequent discussions with management, Mark Healy, analyst at Davy Research said, "we are pulling back 
full-year 2007 revenue by 4.3pc to USD144 million, and with lower growth rates in some segments, reducing full-
ISEQ closes lower on Citigroup backlash
year 2008 revenues by 5.8pc to USD153 million. In earnings-per-shares (EPS) terms, this moves the 2007 figure 
from 53c to 38.7c. We are reducing 2008 EPS from 57.6c to 44.9c."

Body
No frills airline Ryanair has posted a 23pc rise in pretax profits to 459.5m euro.for the six months to September 30.
The figure compares with 372.2m euro in the same period last year.
Passenger numbers grew by 20 pc to 26.6 m.
 Interim profits after tax increased 24 pc to 407.6m euro and revenues also increased by 24 pc to 1.55 bn euro, it 
said, although yields fell by 1 pc. Unit costs increased by 5 pc, mainly due to higher fuel, staff, and airport costs, it 
said. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: 'These record profits reflect a 20 pc growth in passenger volumes, a 
one pc decline in yields, and strong ancillary growth.' Ancillary revenues grew by 54 pc to 252 m euro, due to 
improved penetration of car hire, hotels, travel insurance, as well as strong onboard sales and excess baggage 
revenues and now account for just over 16 pc of total revenues, he said. Total revenue per passenger increased by 
3 pc as a result of the higher ancillary revenues, while passenger load factors decreased by 1 pc point to 86 pc 
during the period, the company said. The airline's new routes and bases performed well over the summer, he said, 
and this winter the airline will open 130 new routes across Europe and new bases at Alicante and Valencia in 
Spain, Belfast City in Northern Ireland and Bristol in the UK. Advance bookings on new routes and bases are in line 
with winter targets, he said. A further one or two new bases for next summer will be announced in the coming 
weeks, he added. The airline continued its share buyback programme by buying 53.5 m shares at a cost of 267 m 
euro over the last the last two months, representing about 3.5 pc of the company's share capital, it said. Ryanair 
said its outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year remains cautious as it had very little visibility beyond the next two 
months. However, based on its current third quarter forward bookings and the impact of Easter in the fourth quarter, 
it anticipates that winter (H2) yields will be better than previously forecast with the expected yield declines being 
towards the lower end of the -5 pc to -10 pc range. As a result it estimates that full year net profits will rise by 17.5 
pc to about 470 m euro rather than the 440 m euro it previously guided.

Among the earnings stories for Monday, Nov. 5, from AP Financial News:
MIAMI (AP) Burger King Holdings Inc. said Monday its first-quarter earnings rose 23 percent, but shares of the 
world's second largest hamburger chain fell more than 6 percent as three big shareholders disclosed plans to sell 
about a third of their holdings.
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's leading no-frills airline, on Monday raised its full-year 
forecast and posted a 26-percent jump in second-quarter profit, helped partly by new routes.
NEW ORLEANS (AP) Power provider Entergy Corp. reported a 19 percent increase in third-quarter profit Monday 
and announced plans to spin off its non-regulated nuclear business in a bid to boost that business' profitability.
FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) Reinsurer Munich Re AG's third-quarter profit rose 70 percent as a rise in premium 
income, tax gains and a benign hurricane season helped offset a drop in investment income, the company said 
Monday.
SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) Profits for Bradesco, Brazil's largest private-sector bank, rose 19 percent in the third 
quarter, boosted by a big increase in its loan portfolio amid strong consumer demand, the company said Monday.

gripped the markets since August is not over yet. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 110.78 points at 7634.98
Banks were the main fallers after Credit Suisse Group said yesterday that it was "too early to predict" an end to the 
market turmoil and analysts downgraded shares of Citigroup. 
 Europe's banking stocks, the worst- performing shares in the region this year, are set to fall further, according to 
Goldman Sachs. "The downgrade cycle is likely to be deeper and longer- lived than anticipated," it said. In the 
financial sector, Bank of Ireland dropped 32c to 11.83 and AIB slipped 53c to 16.17. Anglo Irish Bank fell 00c to 
10.95 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 92c to 14.00. Construction shares fared little better. CRH dropped 
27c to 25.29 and McInerney rose 1c at 1.39. Grafton remained flat at 7.45 and Kingspan was down 36c to 15.94. 
Elsewhere, no-frills airline Ryanair rose 3c to 5.75 on news that reports from Italy that its state council, the country's 
highest administrative court, has suspended the planned reduction in flights at Rome's Ciampino airport. The 
detailed ruling is due on November 6th. Also, British Airways saw its first half pre-tax profit rise by 26pc on steady 
growth in premium traffic and a strong cost performance, helped by the weak US dollar. According to Joe Gill, 
analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers, "in terms of the read-through for Ryanair and Aer Lingus - BA said that "non-
premium traffic has been soft on the North Atlantic and Europe", while noting that the opening of Terminal 5 at 
Heathrow in just 145 days is likely to create some ripples within the aviation market. While the effect of the latter 
remains to be seen, we nonetheless draw comfort from the positive effect on costs arising from the dollar reported 
by BA." Other notable movers include Kerry Group down 27c to 20.90, Smurfit Kappa down 60c to 12.90, Irish 
Continental Group down 25c to 20.75. Shares at media group UTV were unchanged at 5.15 after BSKYB released 
its first quarter results today, with revenues increasing 11pc year-on-year to £1,185. The group generated operating 
profits of £143m. During the quarter, the company had flat advertising revenues of £78m. Management confirmed 
that growth in the advertising sector had been offset by the loss of access to the Virgin Media platform. It is worth

highlighting that advertising represents 6.5pc of total group revenues; the vast majority of revenues are 
subscription-based. "The reported relative strength of the advertising market is a positive for UTV, which generates 
36pc of revenues and 43pc of earnings from its TV division," according to Conor Duffy, analyst at Davy Research. 
Also shares at Independent News and Media were down 6c at 2.47 despite its European peer Schibsted, reports 
strong results on the back of significant online growth.

Body
There was 2 percent wiped off the value of Irish shares today as banks responded poorly to a key interest rate cut 
by the US Federal Reserve.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 165.36 points at 7745.76
The Fed cut its base interest rate by a quarter percent yesterday with the market now speculating there will be no 
more cuts soon.
 Oil prices also added to market woes, rising to their highest ever levels, exceeding USD96 a barrel in New York, on 
ongoing worries over dwindling US crude stocks, simmering geopolitical tensions, OPEC's reluctance to raise 
output and record dollar weakness. Financial shares took a beating. Bank of Ireland fell 64c to 12.10 and AIB 
dropped 79c to 16.45. Anglo Irish Bank fell 65c to 10.95 and Irish Life and Permanent slipped 83c to 14.82. In the 
construction sector, CRH fell 94c to 25.40 and Grafton dropped 22c to 7.47. McInerney slipped 8c at 1.37 and 
Kingspan fell 3c to 16.22. Elsewhere, no-frills airline Ryanair fell 1c to 5.74 while bookmaker Paddy Power slipped 
29c to 28.26. Other notable movers include FBD down 95c to 23.80, ICG down 25c to 25.75, Kerry up 23c to 20.90. 
Irish clinical research group Icon was up E1 to 41.00 after Kendle, a direct peer of Icon's, reported a strong set of 
Q307 numbers and record net new business wins. Shares at Waterford Wedgwood remained flat at 0.03 after the 
company announced yesterday that is to make up to half of its 1,000 Irish workers redundant as part of the "root 
and branch" overhaul of the company that management pledged to undertake at its AGM last month in a bid to 
restore the firm's financial health. The company is in talks to raise a further E67m from the sale of preference 
shares, following the E100m sold earlier this year, to fund this latest round of restructuring efforts. Philip O' Sullivan, 
analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers said, "overall, while this latest cost-cutting exercise will help to trim the firm's 
losses, we note a number of headwinds facing the company which may undermine efforts to restore its fortunes. 
These include economic uncertainty in a number of key markets and also the weakness of the dollar."

Â· Japan Airlines (JAL) has closed a ¥13.9 billion ($120.6 million) Japan Bank for International Co-Operation 
(JBIC)-guaranteed aircraft financing for one new 777-300ER. WestLB is arranger and underwriter. JBIC provides

than 30 aircraft, and provides third-party portfolio asset management, remarketing and financial advisory services.

understanding with the board of directors in which it is to purchase 42.5% of the bank, though the deal is still 
subject to regulatory approval. HE Hussain Al Nowais, chairman of Oasis, describes the acquisition as a strategic 
expansion for Oasis. "This strategic acquisition will provide us with an ideal platform for regional expansion in 
financial services. 
Through this injection of capital by Oasis, we are confident that we will be able to support the existing shareholders 
and management team at Addax to continue their impressive record of success and capitalize on the exciting 
opportunities going into the future."

Shares on the Dublin market closed higher today despite Irish clinical research group Icon plunging nearly 5pc. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 76.03 points at 7911.12. 
Analysts were unavailable to comment on Icon but the group recently raised its full-year revenue and earnings per 
share estimates (EPS) after it reported an increase in third-quarter pretax profit on a 38pc rise in net revenues. Icon 
closed E2 lower at 40.00. 
 With oil prices soaring and the housing market sinking, the US Federal Reserve is set to combat the economic 
turmoil with more interest rate cuts. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his central bank colleagues opened a two-
day meeting on Tuesday afternoon to assess the economic and financial challenges facing the country and plot 
their next move on interest rates. The markets will closely monitor the tone and content of the statement 
accompanying the Fed rate decision to gauge the likelihood of any further rate cuts. Financial shares were mixed. 
Bank of Ireland rose 47c to 12.74 and AIB was up 25c to 17.24. Anglo Irish Bank increased 2c to 11.60 and Irish 
Life and Permanent climbed E1.15 to 16.64. In the construction sector, CRH fell 26c to 26.34 as crude oil reached 
its all-time high of USD94 a barrel on the New York exchange today after data showed a shock fall in crude stocks 
ahead of peak winter demand. Also, the building giant was affected by the dollar as it fell back towards record lows 
against the euro, losing its earlier gains from healthy GDP and jobs data, as markets remained firmly focused on 
the expected cut in US interest rates. Meanwhile, Grafton rose 18c to 7.69, Kingspan dropped 33c to 16.25 and 
McInerney fell 1c to 1.45. Elsewhere, Irish pharmaceutical company Elan climbed 34c to 16.51 and bookmaker 
Paddy Power rose 8c to 28.38. Other notable movers include Ryanair up 10c to 5.75, Iaws up 48c to 16.25 and

Italy's state council, the country's highest administrative court, has suspended curbs on flights at Rome's Ciampino 
airport, meeting a demand from Ryanair Holdings PLC, said Radiocor.
Ryanair had lost its lower court appeal against an order by Italy's civil air regulator ENAC, which imposed a cut on 
overall flights at Ciampino to 100 a day from 138, the news agency said.
The state council will make its detailed ruling available on Nov 6, it said.
Ryanair told the court that Ciampino slot cuts would force it to cut 66 of its weekly 550 flights, with an annual loss of 
500,000 passengers, 500 jobs, and 125 mln eur in tourist spending, it said.
The regulator and regional Rome authorities have argued that the increased flights at Ciampino is causing noise 
and pollution, and favour shifting flights to a new low-cost airport in the area.

(ANSA) - Forli, October 31 - Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has launched flights to Brussels and to Valencia, eastern 
Spain, from the Ridolfi airport in Forli, northern Italy.
The two flights bring the number of destinations operated by Ryanair from Forli to six and add to the previously-
introduced flights to Barcelona, Frankfurt, Dublin and London.
Six years ago, Ryanair made its debut at the Forli airport launching the flight to London. To celebrate its sixth 
anniversary, the carrier had given the opportunity to its customers to book any one-way flight at the price of 5.99 
euro ($8.66), taxes included, between October 31 and November 8, 2007.
The flights to Brussels and Valencia have already marked a considerable success, which is proven by the 6,000 
tickets already booked for Brussels and 8,000 for Valencia. The flight to the Spanish city will be operated four times 
a week, while that to Brussels three times. The company plans to transport 100,000 passengers annually on the 
two new destinations.
Over the six years of operations at Forli, Ryanair has transported 1.5 million passengers.
By the end of 2007 the carrier will register 12 million passengers in Italy.

Shares on the Dublin market closed lower today as the construction sector put in a lacklustre performance. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 32.34 points at 7835.09. 
Financial shares were mixed. Bank of Ireland dropped 3c to 12.29 while AIB climbed 23c to 17.05. Anglo Irish Bank

Prakashan Limited, the Indian publishers in which Independent News and Media has a 20.8pc stake, releasing 
excellent second quarter results yesterday. "The strong local market conditions are evident in the advertising and 
circulation revenue increases of 24.77pc and 8.35pc respectively," according to Conor Duffy, analyst at Davy 
Research. Also, shares at Prime Active Capital remained flat at 1.16 on reports that it is to invest USD5 million 
(E3.5 million) in a chain of mobile phone stores operating in Atlanta, Georgia. The chain, Cellular Center LLC, has 
just opened its 20th store and has aspirations to increase this number to 50. It is fronted by Robert Haulbrook, 
known to Irish investors from his successful time as CEO of Eircom's mobile unit Meteor According to Philip O' 
Sullivan, analyst at Goodbody Research, "overall, we would view this deal, the first to be announced since the 
restructuring of the former Oakhill business earlier this year, as a positive. The management team has pledged to 
increase the size of the company ten-fold through acquisitions in the printing and telecommunications sectors 
primarily, with this deal, while modest in scale, marking a milestone in the road towards achieving this objective."

Tony Fernandes, the driving force behind the creation of AirAsia, the region's first low-cost, short-haul airline, is 
spreading his wings.
On Friday, the latest experiment to test the appetite of travellers for low-cost flying begins in Kuala Lumpur with the 
first flight by AirAsia X to Australia's Gold Coast airport, 40 minutes from Brisbane. Low-cost is going long-haul.
Within a couple of months, a second route from Kuala Lumpur is planned to Huang Zhou in China and, by October 
or November next year, AirAsia X hopes to be flying its first route into Europe to London Stansted or Manchester.
In barely six years, Mr Fernandes has developed Asia's most successful no-frills carrier from an initial base in 
Malaysia, borrowing heavily from the established role models of Southwest Airlines in the US and Ryanair in 
Europe.
An accountant by training after studying at London School of Economics, the 43-year-old came into aviation from 
the music industry, where he had been vice-president for the Asean countries at Warner Music South-East Asia 
before he quit in 2001.
Watching television in a pub in London on his way back from New York to Malaysia, he saw Stelios Haji-Ioannou, 
the EasyJet founder, criticising British Airways.
"I thought it was very interesting. I went to Luton and returned the next day to film (the EasyJet operation). I thought 
it was amazing and thought I could bring that to Asia."
Mr Fernandes says he always loved aircraft as a child. He was sent from Malaysia to boarding school at Epsom 
College and spent many hours at Heathrow plane-spotting on the way back and forth to London.
AirAsia chief spreads his wings The man behind Asia's leading no-frills carrier is taking the low-cost model into 
long-haul, writes Kevin Done
Short, rotund and effervescent, he cuts an unmistakable figure among his peers, with his open-necked white shirt 
worn always with a bright red baseball cap sporting the AirAsia logo. The cap is as much a part of the brand as the 
orange boiler suit affected by Stelios Haji-Ioannou in his early days at EasyJet.
Mr Fernandes has outdone his mentors, building the lowest cost base of any of the world's budget airlines with 
even lower unit costs than Ireland's Ryanair, the world's most profitable airline with operating margins of about 25 
per cent.
He is rapidly conquering the regional, short-haul space in south-east Asia. AirAsia, which began flying at the end of 
2001, will fly about 18m passengers this year. It has a fleet of about 60 aircraft and has secured the foundation for 
future growth with firm orders for 150 Airbus A320-family aircraft and options for a further 50.
The business base in Malaysia has been expanded through AirAsia-branded affiliates in Thailand and Indonesia. 
Another is under discussion in Vietnam and he is keenly eyeing an operation in the Philippines to complete the 
regional jigsaw.
Owning a minority 49 per cent in the ventures outside Malaysia has circumvented national aviation regulations on 
local ownership and control. China is the focus of the current wave of expansion from the bases around south-east 
Asia as he joins up the dots of the network.
"The building blocks are in place," he says, and the business has been well tested.
"We have survived tsunamis, bird flu, earthquakes, coups d'etat, nasty governments and the high oil price."
But now Mr Fernandes is taking the next step of the adventure into uncharted airspace, heading into low-cost long-
haul. It is territory where even Southwest's Herb Kelleher and Ryanair's Michael O'Leary have refused to go.
Mr O'Leary may have changed his tune somewhat from the days when he used to declare that he would "not touch 
long-haul with a barge pole", but even the iconoclastic Irishman is yet to make the leap. Mr Fernandes is not 
waiting. "You only live once," he says.
Scheduled low-cost long-haul services have been tried before and failed in ill-fated ventures such as Freddie 
Laker's Skytrain out of the UK and Peoplexpress in the US 30 years ago.
"My philosophy is very clear," says Mr Fernandes. "Before a business can grow, it needs to have its costs under 
control. It must be cost-efficient and profitable and it must create value. Costs that do not add value must be 
contained, reduced and even eliminated."
The process has no end. "If we do not strive to be more efficient and choose to be complacent, our days are 
numbered," he says. "This is a continuous task we have to face head-on year on year. It is the critical ingredient to 
operate a successful business."
Most of the experimental long-haul start-ups of the past couple of years have come up with business plans very 
much at the other end of the market, leading to the launch of an array of transatlantic all-business class carriers, 
including Eos Airlines, Maxjet Airways, Silverjet and L'Avion.
They have avoided going into the budget end of the market, not least because the legacy network carriers have 
traditionally subsidised low economy fare offerings at the back of the aircraft through the lucrative earnings made 
from premium travellers in the first- and business-class cabins.
Mr Fernandes believes he can still undercut the network airlines by cutting out the frills and avoiding the complexity 
and resulting costs that burden his competitors.
"We will save in simplicity and strictly point-to-point operations rather than the hub-and-spoke model, which is vastly 
inefficient." Secondary airports will be favoured, and AirAsia X will enjoy the feeder traffic from AirAsia's short-haul 
AirAsia chief spreads his wings The man behind Asia's leading no-frills carrier is taking the low-cost model into

network. Connecting passengers will do the work themselves. There will be no costly baggage transfers and 
interlining.
Between Europe and Malaysia, he is aiming at fares 50-60 per cent below the lowest offered by other airlines, with 
a return fare of about Pounds 200, including taxes and charges.
Mr Fernandes may be the driving force behind the move into long-haul but he is taking care not to undermine the 
existing business by any diversion of effort. He is staying as chief executive of Air-Asia itself, and AirAsia X is being 
set up as a separate company with a separate management and capital base.
AirAsia, which was launched on the stock market in Malaysia in 2004, has a stake of about 16 per cent in 
convertible preference shares in AirAsia X and will be linked through the brand and the marketing.
Mr Fernandes and his original partner, Kamarudin Meranun, are the dominant shareholders in both, while Sir 
Richard Branson, a long-term collaborator on the idea of AirAsia X, has also taken a minority stake.
The entry, just agreed, of two private equity funds - Orix from Japan and Manama from the Middle East - has raised 
further funding of Dollars 75m for a 20 per cent stake, valuing the business at Dollars 375m before its first flight.
Very soon, Mr Fernandes will have founded not one airline of his own but two, all in less than a decade.
Heavy brand promotion spreads the word across the globe
With his background in the music industry, it was perhaps inevitable that the holding company for Tony Fernandes' 
stake in AirAsia was called Tune Air. But it was AirAsia that became the brand name.
As a Malaysian of Indian descent - his father was from Goa, hence the Portuguese name - Mr Fernandes is 
promoting the airline's Asian base as he pushes for liberalisation of aviation across south-east Asia while also 
seeking to create a global brand.
With Sir Richard Branson as a mentor and former employer - Mr Fernandes was financial controller at Virgin 
Communications in London in the late 1980s before joining Warner Music International - Mr Fernandes is very 
aware of the power of the brand.
AirAsia's logo is highly visible at sporting events - from the shirt sleeves of English Premier League referees to the 
rear spoilers of the Williams Formula One racing cars and the advertising boards at Old Trafford. AirAsia is a 
platinum sponsor of Manchester United, a powerhouse sporting brand in Asia.
"I am a big believer in brand- building," he says. "I am trying to get my staff to be the Formula One (of aviation). 
Aligning AirAsia with top brands helps . . . also with the bankers. I believe the cost of borrowing has gone down 
through the brand investment."

BBC Radio 4 spoils its listeners with its Book of the Week and Book at Bedtime.
I first discovered Alistair MacLeod's stories long years ago through a World Service repeat of him reading them for 
Radio 4. I rushed in to the Dublin bookshop Hodges Figgis and bought all five copies to give away.
This week's Book at Bedtime was The Ghost, by Robert Harris, read by Douglas Hodge. It's the story of a 
professional ghost writer who sets out to write the 'memoirs' of a former prime minister.
There's a huge fee on offer, but when he goes on a research trip to Martha's Vineyard he discovers that his 
predecessor disappeared in strange circumstances, and the ex-prime minister is a man with many secrets. The 
piece is downloadable at www.tinyurl.com/jfw38.
* I love The Business - a Sunday morning business programme on RTE Radio 1. Every week the programme has 
insightful but easy-listening finance news. Its playful jargon-busting gathers the most horrible examples of unskilled 
verbal labour.
Last Sunday, it was particularly naughty after a listener e-mailed in the story of hearing Ryanair chief Michael 
O'Leary personally giving an impatient announcement in Dublin Airport: ''Will the last two passengers please come 
to Gate 68 - in person."
The Business imagined what would happen if O'Leary took on further duties, such as the safety announcements. 
You could hear the rueful snickers echoing across the country as an actor read the imagined profit-driven 
'announcements'. Listen to it at www.tinyurl.com/2mcqjo.
* Sensational horrors await us as the national water system breaks down. In the final programme of the 
Investigation on 1 series tomorrow night, Philip Boucher Hayes and Alan Torney reveal the complex of big 
business, local government, farms and ordinary houses that pose an increasing risk to our health. The last half hour 
of a series that took a year to make includes figures such as these:
Radio review: Water crisis will be worse than peak oil
* Farmers can be fined  500,000 for polluting water. The maximum fine for big business is just  3,000.
* Dublin consumes 500 million litres a day. By 2016 it will need 700 million litres, but the city currently has only 1 per 
cent spare capacity.
* 25 per cent of houses in Ireland have their waste water connected to the storm drains, instead of into sewerage. 
This untreated water spews into ditches, rivers and streams.
* The only real option for Dublin's future water needs is to pump 350 million litres from the Shannon into the Liffey 
every day.
* There are plenty of rules on pollution, but they are not enforced. Water, not oil, is Ireland's looming resource crisis, 
Boucher Hayes warns. ''Lack of investment and political neglect are exposing us to increased risk of infectious 
disease," he says.
After learning of a multimillion-euro company that was fined a total of  2,000 for several pollution incidents in surface 
water flowing into the highly polluted Lough Sheelin in Cavan, the programme contacted the Department of the 
Environment.
The programme investigators asked if the department intended to review the system whereby the Environmental 
Protection Agency can only pursue companies through the District Courts, whose maximum fine is  3,000. They 
were told no. Since then, the new Green minister has increased the fines for farmers to  500,000, but not the fines 
for businesses.
The Sheelin flows into the Inny, which flows into the Shannon, which is expected to be supplying the drinking water 
of half the population in a few years. Tom Leahy of Dublin County Council told the show that we currently have 
spare capacity of about 1 per cent and the Dublin area's current demand of 530 million litres a day will grow to 700 
million litres by 2016, and 900 million by 2031.
Most shocking is the heartbreaking description by a former public servant of what he calls ''tricks'' used to 
circumvent environmental law by councils.
Long ago, I worked briefly for the publicser vice, and was impressed by the stringent honesty of civil servants who 
always had it in mind that they were representing the people of Ireland and were responsible for those people's 
interests.
Why should some of our councils be dodging the EPA's testing? Are they not representing the public? Why are they 
not protecting us?

At the start of this year, I made a pact with my environmental conscience to travel by train wherever possible in 
Europe. I have broken it three times already. Not good. So coming back to London from the Mayr clinic in southern 
Austria, I was determined to stay on the tracks. People I spoke to at the clinic were aghast. "How long does it take? 
Twenty-four hours? You'll undo all the good work you achieved here - it'll take you a week to get over it." One 
American woman was forthright. "I'd never do that. I just want to get there, wherever I'm going, as quickly as 
possible."
I don't share these people's dismay at the idea of a long train journey: the only thing that horrified me was the price 
- at Pounds 193 one-way it's nearly 20,000 times more expensive than the cheapest Ryanair flight (cost 1p, 
excluding tax). In all sorts of other ways, the idea of planning a leisurely train itinerary appealed to me. I brought out 
my maps of Europe and looked at the route through the eastern Alps and then on through Germany, either the 
more southerly route through Munich and then Paris or going up to Cologne and then Brussels. I anticipated the joy 
and relief I would feel at not having to take another flight back home, with all its associated queuing, inhumane 
herding, and absurd shoe-removal routine.
So how did it work out in practice? Klagenfurt station is already more interesting than Klagenfurt airport and getting 
there allows you a glimpse of the rather handsome small Hapsburg city with its chestnut avenues. There could be 
no cafe in the airport as characterful as the station one where we took our peppermint tea, filled with some of the 
most desperate nicotine addicts in Carinthia.
The train goes quite slowly at first, along the north shore of the Worthersee, with spectacular views of the jagged 
Slovenian alps. The scenery nearly all the way to Munich (five hours) is magnificent: high mountain pasture and 
narrow valleys, towns beetled over by huge rock-cliffs, then Salzburg with its white castle and Baroque domes. I 
remembered, with a shock at the passage of time, travelling this same journey in the other direction with my father 
half a lifetime ago.
The only down side of the first leg was sharing a compartment with an otherwise pleasant young man who played 
twangy music through his computer and made the usual deafening mobile phone calls. This was partly 
Back on track
counteracted by Arthur Rubinstein's Chopin nocturnes conveyed through an iPod, but I think reading in silence 
apart from the clanking of the carriage would have been better.
We had four hours to spend in Munich - no problem at all. We marvelled at the Jesuit church of St Michael, perhaps 
the greatest Renaissance church built in northern Europe, so beautifully restored that you would not guess it had 
been left in ruins in 1944. Then we proceeded to the huge, gaunt Frauenkirche, or Church of our Lady, and finally 
the Augustinerkeller restaurant, where we witnessed a Briton making an idiot of himself. Hardly necessary to point 
out how very different and more rewarding all this felt than flying over Munich at 35,000ft.
My favourite part of the journey, even though it was accomplished in darkness, was the sleeper from Munich to 
Paris. I have found sleeper trains romantic and exciting since I was a small boy and we used to take the overnight 
sleeper to Scotland, arriving to brisk skies, mountains and a breakfast of porridge and kippers. This sleeper was 
really quite comfortable and even when I wasn't sleeping I loved the feel of the rock, roll and soft jolt of the wheels 
over the long snaking tracks leading home. Here you can rewrite Robert Frost's lines "But I have promises to keep/ 
And miles to go before I sleep:" miles to go as you sleep. If you travel this way, you feel the journey in your bones, 
as well as taking it in with your other senses.
Good as all this was, it could not compare with another train journey I took earlier in the year. In spring, I was lucky 
enough to be the guest of Orient Express travelling from Prague to London. I had always thought of the Orient 
Express as a rather pointless and even tasteless anachronism best suited as a set for those ersatz Agatha Christie 
thrillers. What I hadn't taken on board was the astonishing beauty of the carriages made in France and England in 
the 1920s, embellished with marquetry and other fittings by the finest craftsmen of the day including Rene Lalique 
and Rene Prou.
This was certainly slow travel, since the Orient Express never goes more than 80mph. We ground to a halt a few 
times but in the most beautiful places, a field somewhere in Bavaria and then the valley of the river Moselle in 
eastern France. We were three or four hours late coming into Paris but it didn't matter in the least. There was even 
a grand piano in the bar - what more could you ask?

Body
No-frills airline Ryanair today criticised Aer Lingus for raising its fuel surcharges by 30pc to E65 per flight. 
"Ryanair's October 2006 offer for Aer Lingus guaranteed lower fares and the removal of Aer Lingus' fuel 
surcharges. Since then Aer Lingus has done the opposite by raising its already high fares and twice increasing its 
rip off fuel surcharges," Ryanair said in a statement. 
Speaking today, Ryanair's head of communications Peter Sherrard said, "Ryanair is the only airline to guarantee 
Irish passengers no fuel surcharges, not today, not if oil goes above USD100 a barrel, not ever. Aer Lingus is 
gouging passengers with unjustified 30pc fuel surcharge increases when it is getting its fuel at a 20pc discount to 
current market prices. Ryanair again calls on Aer lingus to end its fuel surcharge scam."

Singapore Airlines CEO welcomes opening of Kuala Lumpur route
Singapore Airlines CEO welcomes opening of Kuala Lumpur route

Byline: By GILLIAN WONG, Associated Press Writer
Dateline: ON BOARD FLIGHT SQ380 
Body
Singapore Airlines Thursday welcomed Malaysia's decision to open the lucrative Kuala Lumpur-Singapore route to 
competition from budget carriers AirAsia and Tiger Airways.
"We welcome the liberalization of the route," Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Chew Choon Seng told The 
Associated Press on board the first commercial flight by the Airbus A380 superjumbo from Singapore to Sydney.
Singapore Airline and Malaysia Airline currently control the route under a 34-year-old agreement to protect the two 
state-run airlines. Their governments have targeted liberalizing air travel between Malaysia and Singapore by 
January 2009.
But AirAsia, Southeast Asia's biggest no-frills airline, has been pushing for permission to launch flights on the route 
sooner, saying this would boost Malaysia's aim of becoming a low-cost travel hub.
Malaysian Transport Minister Chan Kong Choy said Thursday in Kuala Lumpur that the Cabinet has given the nod 
for AirAsia to fly the lucrative route, the fourth busiest in Asia.
As a reciprocal arrangement, one Singapore budget airline will also be allowed to operate flights but it was up to the 
city-state to decide which carrier, he said. It is likely to be Tiger Airways, a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, which 
will be allowed to fly at non-peak hours, starting in January, Malaysia's The Star daily said.
"We hold 49 percent in Tiger, so this development is not altogether without its benefits. We are more than confident 
we will hold our own in the market sector we occupy," Chew said.
Meanwhile, the Singapore government also said Thursday it is "fully committed" to liberalizing air services between 
the two countries.
"This includes not only the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route, but also between Singapore and additional cities in 
Malaysia," said a statement by the Ministry of Transport.

On a separate topic, Chew said SIA is happy with the 19 firm orders that it has placed with Airbus for A380s. The 
first one was delivered on Oct. 15, 18 months behind schedule because of a string of problems at the European 
aircraft maker.
The 19 planes "will take us to the end of the decade," he said.
Chew also said Tiger Airways, in which the Irish founders of Ryanair hold a stake, will eventually sell shares to the 
public.
"The plan for Tiger is to eventually go to the market. It will go to the market when conditions are right," he said.
"Our Irish partners in Tiger are not exactly pressing for an IPO (initial public offering). They want to go to the market 
when conditions are optimal and it's not right now," he added.

Body
Passenger traffic at Polish airports jumped by a quarter in the first nine months of the year with regional hubs 
increasing their market share on the back of booming budget carriers, according to data from the local industry 
watchdog (ULC).
More than 14.6 mln passengers flew in and out of Poland from January through September with Warsaw's main 
Okecie airport still accounting for almost half of all the traffic, the data showed.
Balice, outside Poland's southern city of Krakow, was the second biggest airport in terms of traffic, followed by 
Pyrzyce near Katowice. Both airports cater mostly to low budget travellers.
ULC estimates passenger traffic at Polish airports will rise to 19 mln this year from 16 mln in 2006 and expects 
regional airports to increase its shares in the air traffic market as more passengers choose budget airlines, including 
Hungary-based Wizz Air and Irish Ryanair, over traditional carriers.

The Dublin market closed slightly lower today boosted by another solid performance in the banking sector. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 18.04 points at 7749.58
In the financial sector, Bank of Ireland was up 31c to 12.22 and AIB rose 28c to 16.98. Anglo Irish Bank climbed 
17c to 12.37 and Irish Life and Permanent was up 37c to 16.05. 
 Shares in the construction sector were mixed, CRH rose E1 to 26.95 despite second-hand house sales in the US 
plunging to an eight-year low in September. Also, Russian news agency, TASS, has reported that CRH intends to 
build a production plant for construction materials in the Rostov region of southern Russia. The agency did not 
elaborate on the scale of the investment. "The group has long seen Russia as an attractive market, so a move in 
the region would not come as a surprise," according to Robert Gardiner, analyst at Davy Research. Meanwhile, 
Grafton fell 3c to 8.00 and McInerney dropped 7c to 1.57 Kingspan was up 25c to 16.50 Other notable movers 
include no-frills airline Ryanair up 15 to 5.73 and Irish pharmaceutical company Elan up 2c to 16.45 despite Biogen 
Idec, Elan's partner in the development and commercialisation of Tysabri, reporting weaker than expected third 
quarter 2007 numbers. Overall, the company reported a 3pc decrease in earnings per share to USD0.58, which 
was considerably behind market expectations of a 6pc increase to USD0.64. Elsewhere, ICG down 70c to 25.75, 
FBD up 25c to 24.25 and Kerry Group up 37c at 20.22. Shares at Iaws were up 35c to 15.45 after Hiestand, the 
Swiss baked goods (off-bake) concern in which IAWS owns a 32pc stake, reported third quarter organic growth of 
17.4pc. According to John O'Reilly at Davy Research, "organic growth of this magnitude articulates the positive 
environment for part-baked goods in its markets-the key ones are Switzerland and Germany-and Hiestand's ability 
to beat category average growth. IAWS is similarly characterised." Shares at Tullow Oil were up 28c to 8.74 on an 
upgrade from Citigroup, which raised its price target from 620p to 700p. Tullow also helped sentiment by beginning 
the hunt for an outsider on the board, with the resignation of longstanding non executive Rohan Courtney, who is 
resigning as senior independent director.

Shares in Dublin market recovered from losses suffered today boosted by the banks and Icon.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 122.82 points at 7767.62
The biggest gain of the day came for Irish clinical research company Icon, which soared E1.50 to 38.50 after it

 Meanwhile, financial shares put in a solid performance, Bank of Ireland was up 28c to 12.06 and AIB rose 35c to

Group up 18c to 19.70, C and C up 14c to 5.49. Smurfit Kappa jumped 27c to 13.70 despite warning that its full-
year profits would be affected by higher costs. Shares at Tullow Oil were down 4c to 8.46 after it's share price 
declined almost 6pc on Monday as the UK E and P stocks retreated on concerns ranging from economic woes, 
given the credit crunch in the financial markets, to political events in Turkey and Kurdistan. Also, shares at Glencar 
Mining were up 1c at 4.64 after the Irish prospector said a preliminary independent resource study estimates an

Shares in Merrion Pharmaceuticals are to begin trading on the Irish Stock Exchange's IEX market for small and 
medium-sized companies on Tuesday next October 30th.
Merrion will be the 30th company to list on IEX and the first to have a dual IEX/Nasdaq listing.
The company, which specialises in orally-administered drugs, was backed by the late Tony Ryan, the fioudner of 
Ryanair.
 The quote on the IEX is part of a flotation which aims to raise USD 48m by issuing new shares to institutional 
investors on both sides of the Atlantic. It is expected to have a market capitalisation of between USD155m and 
USD180m at the start of trading. Headed by Michael McKenna, who owns 6.1pc of the stock before the new capital, 
was set up in 2003 to exploit drug delivery technology bought from Elan. Merrion was initially backed by Growcorp, 
an Irish life sciences venture capital firm, which currently owns 45.7pc of the equity. The company is developing 
means of taking drugs orally rather than through injections and other "complex treatment regimes". By making 
drugs easier to take, the company hopes to improve patient compliance.

Body
Ryanair made as much profit over the summer season as it did in the full 12 months of its last financial year, 
according to an estimate by the airline's own broker. 
A note this morning from Davy Stockbrokers estimates profits growth over the period April - Sept at 23pc, meaning 
that the airline made profits over the period of 401m euro 
The note by analysts Stephen Furlong says "That is equal to last year's entire profits and or 90pc of our FY 2008 
forecasts. 
 2This leaves a profit of E42.6m or E1.80 per passenger to be achieved this winter, 50pc worse than last year's 
"worst ever" winter profit (E3.50 per passenger)." "The key assumption is the -1pc yields which, stripping out bag 
charges, implies underlying yield declines of 4pc. Negative effects on the yield are APD tax in the UK, Stansted 
airport charges and slight weakness in sterling. Positive factors are the bag charges, the absence of any real 
operational disruption, Aer Lingus's threatened August strike and record wet weather in Northern Europe. "We 
expect a good summer, with Ryanair's lowest fare guarantee continuing to take market share from competitors.

Shares on the Dublin market slumped nearly 2pc this morning after Wall Street plunged last Friday on renewed 
credit fears and record oil prices. 
At 11.10am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 140.22 points at 7651.64. 
Irish investors are anticipating a potential 'Black Monday' after Wall Street shook the markets with a major plunge 
last Friday. 
 The knock-on effect is expected to be felt in Dublin and elsewhere as most of the decline in New York happened 
after the Irish and European markets had already closed. Shares in the financial sector put in mixed performance. 
Bank of Ireland fell 11c to 12.07 and AIB rose 10c to 16.90. Anglo Irish Bank slipped 21c to 12.14 and Irish Life and 
Permanent was down 14c to 14.97. In the construction sector, CRH was down 34c to 26.06 and Grafton fell 21c to 
8.30. McInerney slipped 5c to 1.70 and Kingspan fell 2c to 16.13. US building materials stocks fell on Friday 
(October 19th) as Caterpillar cut its full-year profit guidance for 2007. The company cited weak US construction 
markets being only partially offset by strength in overseas construction. The group reported that the US housing 
industry deteriorated further in the third quarter as housing starts and sales declined and inventories remained at 
near-record highs Elsewhere, Irish pharmaceutical company Elan dropped 37c to 16.10 and bookmaker Paddy 
Power slipped 10c to 27.30. Other notable movers include Ryanair down 16c 5.58, Smurfit Kappa down 32c to 
13.68, Icon down 59c to 38.40. Icon's third quarter results are to be released tomorrow. Goodbody Stockbrokers is 
forecasting that the company will report a 32pc increase in fully diluted earnings per share over Q306 to 46.0c, from 
a similar increase in net revenue to USD160.0m.

Airport passengers facing &euro;4 security charge
Airport passengers facing &euro;4 security charge

Section: IRELAND

Passengers at Dublin Airport are facing a security charge of up to &euro;4 per flight.
Almost 600 security staff are now employed at Dublin Airport, most of them fulltime.
In the last two years alone, the number of security staff at the airport has doubled, according to the Dublin Airport 
Authority (DAA).
The airport's annual security bill is believed to be about &euro;40 million, most of which is paid by passengers. 
Vincent Wall, a spokesman for the DAA, said the maximum airport surcharge that could be added to a fare was 
&euro;13. This would apply equally to a single internal flight or a return long-haul flight.
Wall said surcharges could apply to five areas, three of which were landing charges, including the landing slot itself, 
time and length of the aircraft on the ground, and use of an air bridge. ''Also inbuilt is a general charge for use of the 
airport's services and a security charge,'' Wall said.
There have been issues with the way some airlines - including Ryanair - have applied extra passenger charges. 
According to the DAA, however, airlines that are regulated by the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) can be 
sanctioned if they apply a surcharge of more than &euro;13.
Airlines are free to impose other charges, such as a fuel surcharge or insurance levy. Consumers Association of 
Ireland president Dermott Jewell said applying so many charges was akin to ''using a sledgehammer to break an 
egg''.
''A &euro;4 security charge for a one-way flight within Ireland seems very excessive," he said.
''If every passenger is paying this, and you multiply that by all the passengers who use the airport, it sounds like 
some sort of profit is being generated, which should not be the case.
Airport passengers facing &euro;4 security charge
''It also seems especially unfair that a person travelling one-way to Cork, for example, should pay the same 
surcharge as a return passenger to Asia. I think there needs to be a serious reappraisal of all airport charges in 
Ireland."

Mannion flies in the face of union demands
Mannion flies in the face of union demands

What a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago, Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion was scrambling 
to fend off a hostile takeover from Ryanair and convince investors that the former state airline had a future as an 
independent entity.
By last week, however, Mannion's grip on power was beginning to look more secure as he faced down a challenge 
from pilots opposed to his plans to establish a new base in Belfast.
That he managed to avert strike action and keep planes in the air, while at the same time setting a precedent 
whereby bases set up outside the Republic will employ staff on local terms and conditions instead of the expensive 
legacy deals on offer at Dublin and Cork, may represent one of his finest achievements so far.
Mannion has been slow to trumpet the progress he has made since August, when he walked a tightrope with plans 
to shut the marginally profitable, but politically untouchable, Shannon-Heathrow route, in favour of new routes from 
Belfast. Despite the long-running row that followed, it now appears certain that the route will close as planned in 
January.
The episode saw Mannion establish an important precedent: that of taking decisions that would be in the interests 
of shareholders as a whole, even if the government and unions objected.
The next time Mannion feels the need to do something that the government finds unpalatable, he can feel confident 
that his path will not be obstructed. The government, despite all the noise of recent weeks, has learned to live with 
the fact that it no longer controls Aer Lingus.
The manner in which Mannion faced down the pilots suggested that the unions are also coming around to life under 
the new regime and the plc world.
Mannion flies in the face of union demands
Mannion's victory in Belfast has given him greater ammunition to force through the cost cuts demanded by Aer 
Lingus's institutional shareholders. The airline has signalled that Belfast will be the first of a number of external 
bases.
Mannion is unlikely to run into the same opposition in dictating work practices and pay deals on offer at these bases 
and, in so doing, has laid the platform for a more realistic fixed-cost base.
By establishing bases with lower costs, the cost bases at Dublin and Cork will come into greater focus. If certain 
savings can be achieved at external bases, why can't the same savings be realised closer to home?
Mannion can also use the bases as a significant bargaining chip: if he plans to add a new service from Dublin, but 
finds unions unwilling to accept new work practices, he can dangle the prospect of operating the same service from 
his cheaper base in Belfast instead.
Just as Ryanair expanded by operating flights between other EU countries instead of maintaining an exclusive 
focus on Ireland, Mannion could aim to copy its model to some degree, bypassing new services from Ireland if fixed 
costs at Dublin or Cork make them less viable than flights on non-Irish routes.
Unions will be conscious that uncompetitive cost structures were at least partly to blame for the decision to exit 
short-haul routes from Shannon.
In theory, Mannion could deny new business to Dublin and Cork and even begin to drop existing services down the 
line, if he has more attractive options from other bases.
Mannion will also be conscious, however, that some of his recent progress has come at a cost. By painting the 
government into a corner over Shannon, he may have instigated a review of its 25 per cent shareholding in the 
airline.
If the government feels its stake provides it with little influence, an argument for divesting itself of its shareholding 
could gather momentum.
The support of the government was crucial in fending off the Ryanair takeover, and Mannion may find it more 
difficult to keep Michael O'Leary at bay without such a relatively sympathetic 25 per cent shareholder.
The Belfast episode has also heightened tensions between Mannion and Ryanair, which subsequently moved to 
become Aer Lingus's biggest shareholder with a 29.4 per cent stake.
O'Leary has begun to devote extra attention to using his stake to make life more difficult for Aer Lingus 
management, with two attempts to force a potentially calamitous egm to vote on the closure of Shannon.
Aer Lingus has taken a potentially dangerous route in rejecting Ryanair's egm requests, which Ryanair has claimed 
is a breach of company law. It is a dispute that could turn nasty and have far-reaching consequences.

Fewer than 3 per cent of Aer Lingus shareholders who bought into the airline when it floated last year held onto 
their investment to qualify for free shares a year later.
The former state airline is to award just 700,000 free shares, worth &euro;1.6 million, under the 5 per cent bonus 
scheme that was set up to encourage retail investors to remain on the shareholder register instead of taking a quick 
profit following the flotation.
Investors who took part in the initial public offering were granted one free share for every 20 that they bought, on 
the proviso that they did not sell their shares for 12 months.
The initiative was similar to a feature of the Eircom flotation in 1999, but was undermined by the sudden surge in 
the Aer Lingus share price days after shares began trading, when Ryanair launched its &euro;1.5 billion hostile 
takeover offer.
Aer Lingus shares closed last Friday at &euro;2.35,which was 7 per cent above the &euro;2.20 flotation price. 
Taking account of the bonus share offer, an investor who contributed the minimum &euro;10,000 to buy shares in 
the IPO would now be sitting on shares worth &euro;11,200 - a total gain of 12 per cent.
But this falls considerably short of the 27 per cent gain that was on offer to investors who sold out at the &euro;2.80 
per share offered by Ryanair.

Dollar fall gives soft landing for oil buyers

It was a black week for heavy users of the black gold. Oil prices flirted with the once unthinkable level of $90 per 
barrel, amid fresh jitters sparked by the Turkish government's show of military strength in northern Iraq.
Commodities traders continued to bid prices up to record highs throughout the week, adding 10 per cent - or almost 
$9 - to the price of light sweet crude in New York, which touched $90 on Friday.
The price of Brent North Sea crude, the industry benchmark on this side of the Atlantic, also hit new highs of around 
$85.
Developments in Turkey were just the latest piece of unwelcome news for heavy consumers of oil, such as Ryanair, 
Aer Lingus and CRH. Oil prices have continued to spiral upward in the six years since the September 11 terrorist 
attacks in the US, as buyers fretted about the effects of US military action in Afghanistan and later, Iraq.
This gloomy environment meant that isolated events such as Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the south-
eastern US in 2005, and disruption to oil supplies caused by technical problems affecting refineries and pipelines, 
stepped up pressure on prices.
Further spikes resulted from negative newsflow from supply data, as well as fears that buyers would not be able to 
get their hands on oil in advance of periods of heavy demand in the winter months.
The collapse of the US dollar over the same period, however, has helped to ease the pain of Irish and European oil 
users, despite the problems it has caused for locally-based businesses that export to American markets.
It has also been part of the problem, as the weaker dollar has allowed non-US-based buyers to bid up prices, 
thanks to the higher dollar spending-power they have been given by exchange rate movements.
Last week saw the dollar test new record levels, as it hit an all-time low of $1.43 against the euro. While Waterford 
Wedgwood chairman Tony O'Reilly lamented earlier this month that the luxury goods group now only received 70c 
Dollar fall gives soft landing for oil buyers
for every dollar that it generated in revenue - compared with over &euro;1.20 earlier in the decade - the currency 
shift has also taken much of the sting out of higher oil prices.
Heavy oil users based in the eurozone have seen their dollar spending power shoot up by 70 per cent since the 
dollar peaked at $0.82 against the euro. So, while the price of Brent crude more than trebled from the $27 level at 
which it traded in advance of the September 11 attacks, the increase in euro terms has been less marked.
It cost a little under &euro;30 to buy a barrel of Brent crude in 2001, but the same barrel cost just under &euro;60 at 
last week's prices. From a European perspective, a doubling of prices in unwelcome, but more preferable to the 
pain being felt by US-based oil consumers.
Last week's developments, however, raised the spectre of prices beginning a fresh march to even higher levels, 
with some analysts, particularly in the US, warning that the $100 barrier was now within sight. But this was 
overdoing the gloom to some degree, according to Paul Harris, head of natural resources risk management at 
Bankof Ireland.
Harris said the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the 12strong group of mostly Middle 
Eastern nations that effectively dictates a large portion of world oil supplies, would be likely to reassure markets 
with news of increased supply if last week's squeeze continued.
''Remarks by the Nigerian OPEC delegate that the cartel may act in the face of continued upward price pressure 
have injected a modicum of caution in respect of the current bull run," he said.
''Watchers will keenly await the next meeting of OPEC - the status of next month's gathering is currently informal, 
but any signs that the market is heading into the $90-per-barrel region will inevitably see the meeting upgraded, 
with an expectation thereafter that a statement on production volume will be released."
OPEC has blamed speculators, such as hedge funds and proprietary traders, for the recent increase in prices, 
arguing that concerns over higher demand have been exaggerated.
This was backed up by unexpectedly positive data on US oil inventories last week, which were double market 
estimates. Harris said this ''took the sting out of any upward momentum'' on prices, and acted as a stabilising factor.
The role of speculators could become clearer if prices stage a retreat this week. Some holders of contracts could be 
forced into selling if signs emerge that the market has peaked for the time being and prices begin to move against 
them.
A number of Irish chief executives, including Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, have avested interest in such an outcome. 
Ryanair said in a recent regulatory filing in the US that it had become ''more selective'' in its hedging policy, and had 
opted to take its chances by buying more of its oil at spot rates, rather than taking fixed prices for supplies months 
ahead of their delivery.
Others who are exposed to oil price movements, such as CRH's Liam O'Mahony, have greater flexibility to pass on 
higher oil prices to their customers, and are more concerned about sudden, sharp price hikes than gradual 
increases.
Nonetheless, last week's squeeze was especially unwelcome. When prices smashed through the psychological 
barriers of $50, $60 and even $70 in recent years, buyers were still reassured by the fact that, allowing for inflation, 
prices remained far below the levels seen in the post-oil shock environment of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
As oil prices top $90, however, even that argument is beginning to wear thin. In 1980, the price of a barrel stood at 
$95 in today's prices - a mere 6 per cent over last week's levels.

Budget airline easyJet PLC has no intention of seeking a joint venture to take advantage of the Open Skies 
agreement on trans-Atlantic airline services, says its founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou.
The announcement this week that Air France-KLM Group and Delta Air Lines Inc. planned a joint venture to share 
profits and revenue on trans-Atlantic routes led analysts to suggest that wider combinations in the industry could be 
on the way.
Europe's second-largest budget carrier and its extensive network will not likely be among them.
"EasyJet will not deviate from its current business model of short flights, one class, all economy. Because it works 
so well why go long haul?" Haji-Ioannou told The Associated Press late Thursday. "There are so many other cities 
in Europe you can fly from."
The Open Skies deal, which comes into effect from the end of March 2008, abolishes limitations on trans-Atlantic 
flights, allowing airlines to fly from anywhere in the European Union to any destination in the United States. The 
deal will also end restrictions on what airlines can charge or whether they can combine in joint ventures with other 
carriers.
EasyJet's main rival, Ryanair Holdings PLC, has expressed clear trans-Atlantic ambitions.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in April he was interested in launching a separate trans-Atlantic 
airline by the end of the decade at a startup cost of $145 million to $290 million.
At the time, O'Leary envisioned that the new airline would target a half-dozen U.S. locations. O'Leary also has 
promised to boost the trans-Atlantic services of its Irish rival, Aer Lingus, if Ryanair's year-old campaign to take 
control of that airline ever succeeds.
AP Interview: easyJet not interested in Open Skies venture, Haji-Ioannou says
But "easyJet is definitely a short-haul airline" with a maximum range of about a four-hour flight, Haji-Ioannou said. 
"We have no aspirations to go longer than that."
"As an investor I'm very skeptical about either 100 percent low-cost airlines or 100 percent business-class airlines 
going long-haul," he said, adding that "the current business model of British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa or even 
Virgin Atlantic for that matter, where they have three classes of service, is probably more optimum."
Haji-Ioannou, whose ventures range from car rentals to hotels to pizza deliveries, was in Greece to launch a new 
cruise ship, the 550-passenger easyCruise Life that will begin sailing between the Greek islands and Bodrum in 
Turkey next April.
The first season of the easyCruise venture in Greece, which began in May with the 200-passenger easyCruiseOne, 
sold out quickly last summer indicating that the prices might have been too low, Haji-Ioannou said.
"We sold out too early last year. We kept some cabins back for the Greeks but come June there was practically no 
cruise available to book until September," he said. "So it was success but we probably could have charged a bit 
more."
EasyCruise began in the French and Italian rivieras, but had two unsuccessful seasons there. Haji-Ioannou said he 
believed success was more likely in the Greek islands, many of which can only be accessed by ship.
The trips differ from traditional cruises by sailing for only a few hours a day, giving passengers more time at shore 
destination to enjoy sights and nightlife. The fact that distances between most of the islands tend to be short helps 
keep sailing time and therefore fuel costs low, Haji-Ioannou said.
With the interest the cruise line enjoyed in Greece, Haji-Ioannou said he aims to expand.
"Depending on the financials of the second ship, my intention is of adding one ship a year," he said.
His next venture to open will be easyOffice, temporary office space to be rented in London from Nov. 14. If it is 
successful, he said, "we could probably run it as a franchise."

SanDisk Corp. led the Nasdaq 100 index lower Friday after the company, which makes flash memory, said third-
quarter profit fell 18 percent as a result of acquisition charges.
The index, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, fell 30.82 
points to 2,156.70 in midday trading. The broader Nasdaq composite fell 38.69 points to 2,760.58.
Shares of SanDisk fell $5.66, or 11.3 percent, to $44.61 despite the Milpitas, Calif., company reporting a profit drop

Bellevue, Wash., truck maker Paccar Inc.'s shares fell $3.09, or 5.8 percent, to $50.57.
Ryanair Holdings PLC fell $2.68, or 5.5 percent, to $46.10. The Irish airline is currently battling European Union 
antitrust regulators as it tries to take over rival Aer Lingus. Ryanair currently holds 29.4 percent stake in the 
company.
On the gaining side, Google Inc. rose $8.33 to $647.64, an all-time high, after the online search engine reported a 
46 percent jump in third-quarter profit, helped in part by strong advertising revenue.
Intuitive Surgical Inc. rose $14.16, or 5.5 percent, to $270.44, a seven-year high. The Sunnyvale, Calif., company 
said third-quarter profit rose to $40.9 million, or $1.04 per share, from $17.3 million, or 45 cents per share in the 
year-ago period.
And Biogen Idec Inc. rose $1.43 to $80.74 as the Cambridge, Mass., maker of drugs to treat conditions including 
multiple sclerosis and arthritis continues to explore selling itself. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who recently bought 
shares, expressed interest in the company last week.

Ryanair claims Aer Lingus broke law

Ryanair has made a formal complaint to the financial services watchdog, IFSRA, claiming that Aer Lingus broke 
Irish Company Law and Stock Exchange Rules.
Ryanair, Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder, alleges that Aer Lingus gave a "selective briefing" to one of its other 
shareholders, the Department of Transport, while excluding others.
Ryanair alleges that Aer Lingus management gave market sensitive information (the closure of the Shannon-
Heathrow route) some eight weeks prior to the announcement of this decision to all shareholders through the Stock 
Exchange notice.
 "Ryanair is gravely concerned that one shareholder (the Department of Transport) which only holds a 25pc interest 
in Aer Lingus was repeatedly briefed on this market sensitive information by the Chief Executive of Aer Lingus on 
the June 13; again by the Chairman of Aer Lingus on the 31 July; and again by both the Chairman and Chief 
Executive of Aer Lingus of August 3 - 4 days before the Stock Exchange announcement of this route closure on 7 
August 2007," Ryanair said. "This repeated and selective dissemination of market sensitive information to one 
shareholder up to 8 weeks prior to making all other shareholders aware of the facts is a clear violation of Stock

Shares on the Dublin market were closed the week on a sour note as airlines took a hit after oil prices climbed to a 
record USD90 a barrel.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 87.33 points at 7791.86.
Oil prices hit a record high of USD90.07 a barrel on continuing geopolitical tensions between Turkey and Iraqi 
Kurds in the crude oil-rich northern Iraq.
 Some market players reckon that USD100 per barrel is not an impossible price in the short term, and warn volatility 
is high and will likely remain so next week Airline shares were particularly affected by price high. Aer Lingus 
dropped 2c to 2.35 and no-frills airline Ryanair fell 22c to 5.52. Meanwhile, the financial sector put in mixed 
performance. Bank of Ireland dropped 13c to 12.05 and AIB climbed 6c to 16.86. Anglo Irish Bank fell 8c to 12.27 
and Irish Life and Permanent slipped 11c to 15.00. In the construction sector, CRH fell 28c to 26.02 and McInerney 
dropped 5c to 1.70. Grafton slipped 16c to 8.35 and Kingspan fell 1c to 16.14. Elsewhere, shares at insurer FBD 
rose 30c to 24.40 and bookmaker Paddy Power remained flat at 27.40. Other notable movers include Kerry Group 
up 6c to 20.09, Iaws up 20c to 15.55 and DCC down 12c to 19.90. Shares at Iona Technologies were unchanged at 
2.90 despite posting its third quarter results, which were ahead of expectations both in terms of revenue and 
earnings. Revenues of USD24.2 million represented a 19pc increase compared to the same period last year, while 
EBITDA increased 91pc to USD5.03m and adjusted EPS rose to 12.4c According to Conor Duffy, analyst at Davy 
Research, "the company continues to make progress in open source and registered its first subscription revenues 
in this quarter."

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has filed with the Irish regulators a formal complaint against Aer Lingus for alleged 
regulatory breach.
Ryanair accused Aer Lingus of disclosing market sensitive information to one shareholder, the Department of 
Transport, weeks prior to a formal announcement to shareholders through a notice to the stock exchange. It 
submitted the complaint with the Irish Financial Regulatory Services Authority.
Ryanair is the largest shareholder of Aer Lingus which, in turn, is 25 pct owned by the Department of Transport.
'This appears to be a clear and flagrant breach of Stock Exchange rules by... Aer Lingus and we have asked the 
(regulators) to investigate this matter and take appropriate action,' Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's head of regulatory 
affairs, said.
'It is long past time that the Department of Transport stopped behaving as the downtown office of Aer Lingus, and 
that Aer Lingus stops treating the Department of Transport as its downtown head office,' he said.

Highlight: Shares on the Dublin market closed marginally down today.
Body
Shares on the Dublin market closed slightly down today as construction shares took a beating on the possibility of 
another interest rate hike and the rise in oil prices.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 42.45 points at 7888.82. 
Irish shares suffered falls, in particular building giant CRH and budget airline Ryanair, as oil prices reached to a 
record high above USD87 a barrel amid fears of a Turkish invasion of Iraq. 
 Oil prices surged as Turkey moved a step closer Monday to a possible incursion into northern Iraq as the 
government sought parliament's approval for military action against Kurdish rebel bases despite US opposition. 
Also, shares were affected by the news of a possibility of another European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate hike 
as euro zone inflation surged over the ECB'c preferred level of 2pc in September. Annual inflation in the euro zone 
rose to 2.1pc in September from 1.7pc in August, the Eurostat data agency said. Meanwhile, financial shares were 
mixed. Bank of Ireland was up 1c to 12.35 and AIB climbed 5c to 16.68. Anglo Irish Bank rose 14c to 12.44 while 
Irish Life and Permanent slipped 2c to 15.38. In the construction sector, CRH dropped 54c to 26.80 and Grafton fell

Flybe has become Europe's largest independent carrier as the UK airline has reinvented itself in a changing market
As the members of the European Regions Airline Association meet for their general assembly in the Olympic 
homeland of Athens this week, their arena is increasingly being invaded by budget carriers. But are they contending 
for the same prize and can there be only one victor?
The dividing line between Europe's low-cost and regional carriers is blurring, as budget carriers build regional 
presence and hybrid models emerge, such as Flybe in the UK.
Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley claims this is increasingly squeezing regional airlines out of the 
market: "There is less and less room for regional carriers because low-fare airlines, led by Ryanair, are bypassing 
hub connections for a fraction of the price and offering what the market really wants - low fares. That means that the 
only market left for regional carriers is the small pool of regional passengers who need a connection from the 
regions to one of the big hubs to travel long haul."
But ERA air transport policy director Andrew Clarke says regional carriers are continuing to flourish in the face of 
budget competition. Over the first five months of 2007, European regional passenger numbers rose by 8%. "This 
shows that the regional air industry is expanding," says Clarke. "Low-fares airlines are a new phenomenon, but 
regional airline expansion is still a fact as well."
The regional manufacturers agree. Executives from ATR, Bombardier and Embraer say that Europe's regional 
carriers still serve an important feeder and point-to-point role.
Embraer says: "EasyJet and Ryanair are using regional airports mainly to access nearby high-density markets, 
therefore not directly impacting true regional routes. Regional airlines are focused on business passengers in 
medium- and low-density markets, avoiding low-cost carrier competition. In general, low-cost carriers impact the 
revenue environment with their low-fare policies creating challenges for small capacity aircraft operations in the 
same area."
'NORMAL' FARES
Raid on regionals
Jean-Yves Grosse, chief executive of Air France subsidiary Regional, agrees that the new reference point for 
"normal" fares has been a challenge. "Ryanair and EasyJet, up to now, have had clearly differing strategies," he 
says. "EasyJet is more focused on the business market, which remains the central part of our own strategy. There 
the competition tends to be more direct."
By deploying small aircraft, regional carriers fulfil two roles. They offer high-frequency flights with connectivity for 
business travellers and serve thin regional routes that cannot be sustained by larger aircraft.
Clarke says: "The fact that more flights between two points are served by low-cost airlines still leaves a vast swathe 
of markets that aren't connected. The regional airlines serve that market by feeding into hubs. Regional airlines are 
very flexible. If one market becomes unsustainable, they can move on to another. As low-fares airlines grow, they 
will enter markets that our carriers have been serving previously. Only a small proportion will be affected."
Business travellers account for roughly half of ERA members' traffic total. Clarke says budget carriers fail to offer 
the frequency and connectivity that business travellers need. He says this business-class niche means that fully 
inclusive service remains a competitive priority for Europe's regional carriers.
But Barry MacKinnon, Bombardier Regional vice-president for markets and airline analysis, says European network 
airlines such as Air France are simplifying their short-haul product and this is being replicated by their regional 
carriers. "A lot of [European] CRJ900 customers are operating with 90 seats. The USA is going in a somewhat 
different direction, with two or three classes. We certainly have plenty of examples of our clients operating in 
Europe in the low-fares environment. It is a new growing segment. You can argue that the budget model has been 
taken down to smaller city pairs of regions."
Examples include Q400 operator Flybe in the UK, Italian CRJ1000 launch customer Myair and CRJ900 operator 
Atlasjet of Turkey.
NEW MARKET SEGMENT
MacKinnon adds: "Flybe is an exciting example of a new market segment. What it is doing with Q400s is targeting 
markets that may not suit Boeing 737 operators like Ryanair."
Exeter-based Flybe, which recently acquired British Airways regional arm BA Connect, has become Europe's 
largest independent regional carrier. Starting life in 1979 as Jersey European Airways, it was rebranded British 
European in 2000. Flybe emerged in July 2002 when British European was forced to dramatically change its 
business model to survive in the low-fares era.
Flybe chief commercial officer Mike Rutter says: "The model of the regional carrier, which had historically been 
there, had become defunct. If we didn't want to be usurped by changes in low-cost carriers, we had to change 
rapidly."
Rutter believes the UK regional sector has been redefined. Under Flybe's low-cost regional model, it has right-sized 
its fleet with Bombardier Q400s and Embraer 195s to serve routes uneconomical for 150-seat operators. He says: 
"The Ryanairs and EasyJets of this world tend to concentrate on sectors of 2h or more, leaving carriers like us to 
have the right kind of model and vacuum up the rest of the market. As a result of that, what you've got is a 
shrinkage of regional carriers in the UK market place.
"We don't particularly worry ourselves about the regional operators at the bottom end. The guys in larger aircraft 
sector learn that they can't make money and pull back. We are winning the long-term strategic battle, but there are 
always a number of short-term tactical battles." Rutter says competition is "ferocious" on the 5-7% of its routes 
where Flybe's network overlaps with the larger budget carriers, but competition has diminished over time.
Within three to five years Rutter believes that Europe's regional carriers will be pushed into a niche role, serving thin 
business routes, as the budget regional model spreads.
Raid on regionals
Flybe is looking to capitalise on this development. It is planning to export its business model by 2009-10, mirroring 
its UK operation in mainland Europe. Rutter identifies France, Scandinavia and Spain as potential candidates, 
owing to their hub-and-spoke focus and underdeveloped point-to-point regional networks. Clarke believes other 
carriers will follow Flybe's example: "I am sure the line will blur. Given Flybe's obvious success, I am sure others will 
explore the market opportunities." 
But Embraer says the regional low-cost model is too young to be considered a new segment: "We understand that 
the fundamental change is from a set of discrete and defined business models to a more gradual and continuous 
blurred area between the traditional four models: legacy, low-cost, regional and charter carriers." 
Although regional airlines have always had to be cost-conscious, budget carriers have hit yields and encouraged 
renewed cost scrutiny. Together with spiralling fuel prices, this has increased demand for aircraft with low seat-
kilometre costs and helped to revitalise the turboprop market.
Efficiency rules
ATR senior vice-president commercial John Moore says: "To some extent, this has contributed to the success of 
ATR. Major and regional airlines have to focus on controlling their costs. They need to use the most efficient 
aircraft. We've seen a dramatic increase in the demand for our aircraft over the last few years, which has partly 
been driven by demand from carriers trying to offer low costs on a regional basis and competition from low-cost 
carriers."
ATR's low-cost customers include Philippine low-cost carrier Cebu Pacific and India's Air Deccan. Moore says this 
emerging low-cost regional sector will create additional opportunities for ATR, but he does not see it forming the 
majority of its sales.
Bombardier's MacKinnon agrees that the increased competition has had a positive impact on European demand. 
He says the call for larger aircraft with lower seat-kilometre costs is part of the genesis behind the new CRJ1000, 
set to enter service in late 2009. "This is expanding our market. We are getting additional sales from this and view it 
positively. It has been folded into our forecasts. We are well positioned because we are the only manufacturer 
offering turboprops and regional jets," he says.
Embraer also welcomes changes within the market, saying: "Some legacy carriers are using our aircraft to right-
size narrowbody flights and keep a presence in medium-density markets."
In 1988 two-thirds of aircraft in the European regional fleet had fewer than 40 seats. By 1997 this had declined to 
31% and today the figure is 13%. Clarke says: "We've seen a huge change in aircraft size. We are seeing a 
constant move towards larger aircraft."
continuing trend
ATR, Bombardier and Embraer acknowledge this trend - which has prompted a flurry of large regional aircraft 
development over recent years - and see it continuing unabated.
They suggest a number of potential triggers for the upsizing, including increased infrastructure and fuel costs, 
environmental concerns, unit cost minimisation, market liberalisation and general traffic growth.
Moore says the 70-seat ATR 72 accounts for roughly 80% of ATR's current demand, having gradually overtaken 
the smaller ATR 42. But despite the shift, ATR has no plans to shelve the entry-level model. Moore says: "We are 
seeing good steady demand for [the ATR 42]. We don't see the market going away and do not hold the view that 
there is no further demand. It has probably stabilised where it is now."
ATR is forecasting demand for 2,700 new turboprops between now and 2026. Around 85% will be in the 60- to 90-
seat category. Moore says ATR is studying the market for a larger turboprop aircraft, but has not made any 
decisions. Bombardier forecasts a need for 5,300 aircraft in the 20- to 99-seat segment over the next 20 years, with 
turboprops accounting for 15-20% of the total, while Embraer expects demand for 7,500 30- to 120-seat jets. The 
Raid on regionals
Brazilian manufacturer expects airlines to increasingly use 70- to 120-seat to right-size their fleets and bypass 
congested hubs.
Embraer believes that the 30- to 60-seat market has matured, but it says these aircraft will continue to play an 
important role in the regional sector. Although the 50-seat jet renewal cycle will begin in 2015-20, lasting at least 
five to 10 years, Embraer does not see a market for aircraft with fewer than 50 seats.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects entry-level aircraft of around 70 seats, but says: "As the economy continues to 
grow throughout Europe, we could see some long and thin market opportunities with good yields demanding a 
niche 50-seat jet service."
ATR also recognises a niche for smaller capacity operations. Moore says ATR has no plans to develop any smaller-
capacity aircraft, despite a lack of new-build products to fulfil this potential market, but says it will be interesting to 
see how the market progresses.
He says: "Fewer and fewer regional carriers are still operating 30-seat aircraft, so that has created a niche 
opportunity for small carriers to fill that gap. It is a market that large regional carriers will find difficult to make sense 
of."
Used aircraft
Moore says larger regional carriers are limiting the number of types within their fleets, potentially fuelling this niche. 
He suggests this demand could be partly met with used aircraft. ATR forecasts demand for 135 aircraft in the 15- to 
39-seat category over the next 20 years and 270 in the 40- to 59-seat segment.
Bombardier forecasts a need for 1,000 aircraft in the 20- to 59-seat range. MacKinnon believes infrastructure costs 
and environmental concerns will stem demand for small aircraft in Europe. Like Moore, he sees used aircraft as a 
source of entry-level capacity.
He says: "I don't think we'll see entry-level aircraft with fewer than 30 seats in Europe. The costs are too high. We 
are hard pressed to see new opportunities in the 30-seat segment in Europe."
Clarke says that ERA member Eastern Airways, a British Aerospace Jetstream specialist, has more than 20 routes 
in the UK and few face competition. He says: "It shows that even with the prevalence of low-fares airlines, there are 
many routes that are a regional airline niche."
Last year Eastern was forced to axe its Manchester-London Stansted link due to competition from German budget 
carrier Air Berlin. But Air Berlin found it unviable, and Eastern is planning to resume the link in October.
As budget and regional carriers hone theirskills and financial fitness, perhaps both can be winners in the race for 
market share.

Highlight: While Ryanair is by far the most cost-efficient and profitable low-cost airline, Aer Lingus is well placed to 
survive.
Body
While Ryanair is by far the most cost-efficient and profitable low-cost airline, Aer Lingus is better placed to survive 
the cut-throat world of no-frills aviation, a major report from Goodbody Stockbrokers shows today.
Analyst Joe Gill looked at seven low-cost airlines around Europe and found that only EasyJet and Aer Lingus come 
anywhere close to the cost disciplines exercised by Ryanair but both are well ahead of the likes of Aer Berlin, 
Norwegian, SkyEurope and Vueling.
On the basis of the report, Mr Gill recommended that investors add Aer Lingus to their portfolios along with Ryanair 
and EasyJet and cut the other four.
 The report used Available Seats per Kilometre (ASKS) to draw comparisons between the airlines. It found that, 
while total unit costs per ASK for Aer Lingus is some 82pc higher than that of Ryanair, it is just 7 points away from 
drawing level with Ryanair's biggest European competitor, EasyJet. Aer Lingus falls down badly on staff costs at 
14.7, by far the highest of all seven carriers, some 306pc behind Ryanair's 4.8 and double EasyJet's 7.4. On 
revenues, Mr Gill found that Ryanair has unit sales that are 22pc lower than the average of the other six carriers but 
its unit costs are a massive 40pc lower than all the others. It is this fixation with keeping a lid on costs throughout its 
operations that singles Ryanair out as the most profitable in Europe and "threatens the profitability of any carrier 
with higher unit costs," he said. "Ultimately, the most important measure in all of these businesses is unit 
profitability. On a per ASK basis it is evident that Ryanair is generating the highest margins," he said. However, 
while well behind Ryanair's profitability per ASK, Aer Lingus still makes a profit while three of its competitors, 
including EasyJet, make a core earnings margin percentage loss.

Body
Shares on the Dublin market closed significantly down today despite Irish pharmaceutical company Elan surging 
6pc on news that it will have the right to buy up its US partner, Biogen's share of MS drug, Tysabri, if Biogen is sold.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 89.24 points at 7931.27
Shares at Elan rose 99c to 16.79 after Biogen said last week that it has put itself up for sale.
 However, part of its partnership deal with Elan says that the Irish firm has the right to buy the MS drug in its entirety 
in the event of a change of ownership. It also has the right to sell its Tysabri interest, continue the pact or 
restructure it, it said. According to Jack Gorman at Davy Research, "Elan has a number of options open to it should 
a Biogen deal materialise. It can acquire Biogen's 50pc interest in Tysabri, sell its own stake in certain 
circumstances, or continue with a prospective new owner under the existing or a restructured collaboration. In any 
case, a Biogen transaction will help crystallise value for the Tysabri franchise." Meanwhile, in the financial sector,

Body
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, has rounded on the Department of Transport, calling for its closure or 
renaming to 'Department for Useless Monopoly Protection' (DUMP).
He accused the Department of acting as 'a downtown office for Aer Lingus'.
'In 2002 the Fianna Fail led Government promised there would be a competing terminal at Dublin Airport . 
Subsequently the Department of Transport awarded the second terminal to the same DAA monopoly who have so 
mismanaged the first terminal. This has resulted in the cost of Terminal 2 exploding fourfold from E200m to over 
E800m,' he said.
 The Aviation Regulator has confirmed that if these plans proceed, then passenger charges at Dublin Airport will 
double from the current high base, he added. 'The Department of Transport clearly prefers Aer Lingus's higher air 
fares and increasing fuel surcharges over the needs of consumers. As usual the Department of Transport have a 
policy of protecting inefficient operators like the DAA and Aer Lingus at the expense of the consumer,' he said.

Ryanair could be prevented from voting at meetings of Aer Lingus shareholders - even if it is permitted to retain its 
29.4 per cent stake in the former state-owned airline.
Aer Lingus instigated legal action in the European Court of First Instance last week, seeking to force Ryanair to sell 
its shares in the company. The company said it would also ask the court for a ruling that would stop Ryanair 
''interfering in the running of Aer Lingus's business''.
Aer Lingus is hopeful that the court will apply a ruling that would go as far as preventing Ryanair from using its 
stake to influence the outcome of shareholder votes.
This could see Ryanair's shareholding effectively frozen by stripping the carrier of the voting rights attached to its 
shares. Such a move would remove Ryanair's current veto on so-called ''special resolutions'', which require the 
support of 75 per cent of shareholder votes at annual general meetings and extraordinary general meetings. It 
would also make it easier for the board of Aer Lingus to win support for motions its puts to shareholders.
Aer Lingus is scheduled to hold an extraordinary general meeting before the end of the year that will ask 
shareholders to approve the purchase of new long-haul aircraft.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, has previously indicated that he would not use the airline's stake to 
unnecessarily disrupt shareholder meetings or vote against management proposals.
But relations between the airlines have deteriorated sharply following O'Leary's requests to convene a meeting over 
Aer Lingus's decision to axe its Shannon-Heathrow route.
The Aer Lingus board rejected these requests, citing concerns over possible breaches of competition law.

Tiger Airways, the Singapore-based airline backed by the family of the late Tony Ryan, is in talks with investors 
about expanding into new territories.
The budget airline plans to start flying within Australia during the next month and is already considering other 
routes. Tony Davis, chief executive of Tiger, said the airline was likely to strike deals with local investors that would 
take a majority stake in any new joint venture.
By doing so, Tiger, which started flying in September 2004, could overcome foreign ownership rules that are in 
force in Asia. ''There is certainly plenty of interest from such strategic investors about creating this kind of joint 
venture," Davis was quoted as saying in British reports. The Ryans own 16 per cent of Tiger.
The main shareholder is Singapore Airlines, with a 49 per cent stake. Last month, Tiger set up a new holding 
company, Tiger Aviation, to give it more flexibility to form subsidiaries and raise funds for new aircraft.
The airline has struck a supply deal with Airbus and plans to expand its fleet from nine aircraft to 26 by the end of 
2010 and 72 aircraft by 2016.
Tiger faces competition from rivals, including Air Asia, but hopes to become one of the dominant low-cost airlines in 
the region.
''We still have a long way to go until LCCs [low-cost carriers] are established in Asia the same way they are in the 
US or Europe," Davis said. However, he said low-cost airlines were an alternative to rail in Asia and the growth 
opportunities for airlines were ''tremendous''.
Tiger had been linked to a stock market flotation this year, but then said that it did not expect to complete a listing 
until at least next year. Indigo Partners, an investment company co-founded by Ryanair chairman David 
Bonderman, owns 24 per cent of Tiger.
Tiger Airways seeks expansion
According to Tiger's website, the firm ''is based on Europe's successful Ryanair, which uses its very low-cost base 
to offer competitively low fares on a consistent basis. It also involves scrutinising every single aspect of the 
business to remove nonessential costs''.
Ryan, the founder of Ryanair and Guinness Peat Aviation, died earlier this month, aged 71.

Coffey Construction, a Galway firm involved in building the new second terminal at Dublin Airport, had turnover of 
more than &euro;95 million last year.
The company made a pretax profit of &euro;1.25 million, compared with a profit of &euro;1.6 million in the 16 
months to the end of 2005. Turnover last year was &euro;95.3 million, a slight increase on the &euro;118.5 million 
recorded in the previous 16month period.
At the end of last year, Coffey Construction had a retained profit of &euro;7.4 million and stocks valued at 
&euro;42.8 million. The company is 39.3 per cent owned by Patrick Coffey, while Thomas Coffey and Olive Coffey 
had stakes of 38.3 per cent and 15.3 per cent respectively. The three are directors of the firm, alongside Mark 
Coffey and Noel Kerrigan.
T he directors shared &euro;1.6 million in remuneration and pension contributions last year, according to recent 
accounts. The company employed 493 people and its employment costs came to &euro;24.8 million.
Coffey Construction is part of a consortium with two Portuguese companies that recently won a contract worth 
almost &euro;50 million for the cladding of a new terminal at Dublin Airport.
The 75,000 square-metre Terminal 2 (T2) was granted planning permission by An Bord Pleanala this month, but 
low-cost airline Ryanair has applied for a judicial review of this decision, because it considers the terminal too 
expensive.
Contracts worth a total of &euro;180 million were awarded to seven contractors by Dublin Airport Authority earlier 
this month.
The cladding contract awarded to Martifer, Moto Engil and Coffey, was one of the largest.
&euro;95 million turnover for airport construction contractor
The other contractors who will be working on T2 include Alandale Logistics (general building); Fitzpatrick (apron 
works); Laing O'Rourke (substructure and superstructure concrete);McAvoy Group (accommodation); Siac 
(enabling works and services); and Watson Steel Structures (steelworks).
The contracts represent the first tranche of 17 construction packages making up theT2 project. The project - which 
includes a 75,000 square metre terminal building, a 24,000 square metre departures pier and other airport campus 
upgrades - has been broken into 17 separately-tendered elements.
Construction is expected to start next February, and is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2009.
T2 will open to passengers in early 2010 and will increase the annual capacity at Dublin airport to 32 million 
passengers.

Body
Dublin shares closed the week on a sour note with the index plunging as investors bailed out of banking and 
building stocks. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 162.25 points at 8020.51.
The ISEQ was the worst performer in comparison to other European bourses, which clocked up only moderate falls. 
Banking shares on the Irish exchange plunged after new figures from the Central Bank showed that the rate of 
growth in mortgage lending slowed again in August, pointing to substantially lower lending levels to come. 
Construction shares were also affected by the news as the figures reflect the continuing slowdown in the country's 
housing market. Markets will also be watching speeches from a number of Fed officials over the week, which may 
point to a possible cut in interest rates later this month. Meanwhile, shares in the financial sector all took a beating. 
Bank of Ireland dropped 37c to 12.75 and AIB slipped 47c to 17.21. Anglo Irish Bank fell 27c to 12.90. Elsewhere, 
shares at bookmaker Paddy Power dropped 6c to 25.31 and no-frills airline Ryanair slipped 12c to 5.55. Other 
notable movers include Icon down E1 to 38.50, DCC down 6c to 21.15 and FBD down 10c to 24.70 despite

The European Commission confirmed it is unable to force Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC to dispose of 
its 29.4 pct shareholding in flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC.
A spokesman for EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: 'A decision was adopted this morning by the 
commission confirming that, in the view of the commission, it is unable under the EU merger regulation to require 
Ryanair to reduce its minority stake in Aer Lingus.'
'Essentially, this is the case because the minority stake does not confer control and the merger regulation only 
allows the commission to intervene if a party has effective control of another company'.
'The decision was taken following a formal complaint from Aer Lingus against the commission for failure to act and 
therefore this decision rejects the Aer Lingus complaint,' he added.
Yesterday, Aer Lingus said it would start legal proceedings to force Ryanair to dispose of its minority stake.
The commission's decision allows Aer Lingus to make an appeal to the Luxembourg-based European Court of First 
Instance (CFI).
Aer Lingus said it believes EU merger regulation does, in fact, give the commission the power to force a stake sale 
because the stake was part of the original takeover attempt of the carrier by Aer Lingus which the commission 
blocked.
Aer Lingus said its application to the CFI will be made in the coming weeks.

European Union antitrust regulators said Thursday that they did not believe they had the power to order Irish airline 
Ryanair PLC to sell a large stake in rival Aer Lingus Group PLC.
The European Commission refused to allow Ryanair's hostile €1.48 billion (US$1.9 billion) takeover in June, saying 
it would create a monopoly for flights from Dublin airport.
But the EU's executive arm rejected a formal complaint from Aer Lingus that accused regulators of failing to uphold 
EU law because it has not ordered Ryanair to offload its 29.4 percent holding in Aer Lingus.
EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said antitrust officials believe they could only intervene if a company had "effective 
control" of a takeover target.
"In the view of the Commission, it is unable under the EU merger regulation to require Ryanair to reduce its minority 
stake in Aer Lingus essentially because this minority stake does not confer control," he said.
Aer Lingus said Wednesday it planned to challenge regulators at the EU's appeals court, the Court of First 
Instance, to force them to act.
Todd said the Commission believed its understanding of the rules was clear but it would follow any court order that 
told them differently.
"If Aer Lingus were to appeal to the court as they have indicated they intend to and if the court were to interpret the 
merger regulation in a different manner than we have thus far that would be for the court and we would of course 
respect the court's ruling," he said.
Ryanair has become the biggest Aer Lingus shareholder in hopes of eventually taking over its rival but it faced an 
uphill struggle to reach the 50 percent level it needed for a successful bid.

Other shareholders, led by the Irish government with 25 percent, and Aer Lingus employee controlled trusts holding 
more than 15 percent of shares both fiercely opposed the Ryanair approach.
Ryanair has also swore to take the European Commission to court for blocking its bid. It is only the second time 
since 2001 that regulators have stopped a takeover from going ahead.

Aer Lingus to take legal action to force Ryanair sale
Aer Lingus to take legal action to force Ryanair sale

Body
Aer Lingus is to take legal action to force Ryanair to sell its 29.4 per cent stake in the former Irish state-owned 
carrier after the European Commission indicated it would not use its powers to force a disposal.
The move follows the Commission's earlier ruling prohibiting a takeover bid by Ryanair on grounds of unfair 
competition.
Lawyers say the Commission has often forced bidders to dispose of a stake when a bid is deemed illegal under 
competition rules but in this case because the offer had lapsed it allowed Ryanair to retain its stake.
Aer Lingus is to apply to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg once the Commission has published its formal 
ruling on the disposal, expected next week.
John Sharman, Aer Lingus chairman, said the company was "fully prepared to face competitive opposition on the 
runways" but Ryanair was using its shareholding to "interfere with the commercial business of Aer Lingus and to 
further its own interests". Alec Burnside, of Linklaters, Aer Lingus' legal advisers in Brussels, asked: "Is it desirable 
for Ryanair to have a 30 per cent stake of its main rival?"
The stake-building by Ryanair started in the days following the initial public offering of Aer Lingus last year. 
However, a coalition of the government's 25 per cent, a stake controlled by a workers trust and stakes acquired by 
a pilots group and by Denis O'Brien, the telecoms entrepreneur, stymied Ryanair's bid.
Ryanair has twice called for Aer Lingus to hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting to discuss a recent decision 
to switch its Aer Lingus' Heathrow service out of Shannon to Belfast.
The closure of the Shannon route was strongly criticised by local politicians and business groups, but the Dublin 
government declined to intervene on the grounds Aer Lingus was now a commercial company.
Ryanair said: "It is impossible to claim that Ryanair have any influence over them. We presume this initiative was 
designed to cover Aer Lingus' embarrassment at the current share price of Euros 2.35, which is 20 per cent lower 
than Ryanair's offer of Euros 2.80 almost one year ago."

Tiger Airways, the Singapore-based budget airline that will start flying within Australia next month, is negotiating 
with investors to establish operations in a third country as it continues to expand.
Tony Davis, chief executive, told the Financial Times the joint venture would most likely be majority-owned by local 
investors, although the agreement would give Tiger substantial leeway over commercial and operational 
arrangements.
"The foreign ownership limits in most of Asia necessitate local partners but there is certainly plenty of interest from 
such strategic investors about creating this kind of joint venture," said Mr Davis.
The negotiations underline the extent to which Tiger and rivals such as Malaysia-based AirAsia are trying to expand 
rapidly their geographic footprint to emulate the success of low-cost airlines in the US and Europe.
Tiger's leading shareholder is Singapore Airlines but another significant investor is the family of Tony Ryan, the 
recently deceased founder of Ryanair, the European low-cost carrier. "We still have a long way to go until LCCs 
(low-cost carriers) are established in Asia the way they are in the US or Europe," Mr Davis said. "But if you look at 
the road and rail networks in a region like south-east Asia, as a transport alternative, the growth opportunities for 
LCCs are tremendous."
Last month, Tiger created a new holding structure, Tiger Aviation, giving it "a lot more flexibility'' to form Asian 
airline subsidiaries, as well as making it easier to raise funding to help cover the cost of new aircraft.
Following a deal with Airbus, Tiger is planning to expand its fleet from nine aircraft to 26 by the end of 2010 and 
then 72 aircraft by 2016.
Some new budget airlines in Asia have opted for a mixed fleet, as well as a two-class structure to attract business 
passengers away from the legacy carriers.
Tiger eyes venture in third territory
Mr Davis, however, said Tiger would remain "a purist", sticking to a fleet of Airbus A320s to help contain costs in 
what promises to be a much more competitive Asian market. "What is becoming clear in Asia, as has been the case 
in North America and Europe, is that ultimately two or three LCCs will become pre-eminent," he said.

Following a recent deal with Airbus, Tiger is planning to grow its fleet from nine aircraft to 26 by the end of 2010 and 
then 72 aircraft by 2016.
Concerning the timing of a mooted initial public offering, Mr Davis said: "There's no immediate need to inject more 
cash in the business. So as to an IPO, it's obviously something the shareholders will consider at the appropriate 
time."

Highlight: Ryanair has files complaint with EU over Lufthansa over surcharges/
Body
No-frills airline Ryanair said it had lodged a formal complaint with the European Commission over increases made 
by Deutsche Lufthansa , Air France-KLM and Swiss on Sept 25 to their fuel surcharges.
Speaking today in Hamburg, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said, "In a six hour period on 25th September, four 
airlines which account for some 30pc of the European short haul market, Lufthansa, Swiss, KLM and Air France all 
increased their fuel surcharges by another E5 to as high as E70 per seat. Last month British Airways was fined by 
the British and American Governments for price fixing.
"This latest abusive increase in fuel surcharges highlights the lack of competition between the European mega-
carriers, who continue to gouge European consumers by imposing bogus fuel surcharges. Ryanair is the only airline 
in Germany to guarantee passengers that they will never have to pay fuel surcharges, not now, not ever."

Aer Lingus is to take legal action to force Ryanair to sell its 29.4 per cent stake in the former Irish state- owned 
carrier after the European Commission indicated it would not use its powers to force a disposal.
The move follows the Commission's earlier ruling prohibiting a takeover bid by Ryanair on grounds of unfair 
competition.
Lawyers say the Commission has often forced bidders to dispose of a stake when a bid is deemed illegal under 
competition rules, but in this case, it allowed Ryanair to retain its stake because the offer had lapsed.

Ryanair suing France in Euro Court of Human Rights, hopes to avoid French labor laws

Ryanair Holdings PLC said Wednesday it will sue France in the European Court of Human Rights in hopes of 
preventing its French-based staff from being subject to French labor laws and social security taxes.
The action follows a July verdict by the Council of State, France's highest administrative court, against Dublin-
based Ryanair and British budget carrier easyJet PLC.
The Paris court ordered both airlines to comply with a November 2006 government decree requiring them to 
observe French labor laws for their employees based in France. The court also refused to refer their complaints to 
the European Court of Justice.
While easyJet accepted that ruling, Ryanair said Wednesday it would mount a fresh legal challenge at the 
European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.
Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs, Jim O'Callaghan, accused the Council of State of a conflict of interest, saying it 
had offered legal expertise to the earlier French government decree.
"This bizarre confusion of consultative and judicial functions within the French supreme court ... denied Ryanair the 
right to fair trial and made it necessary for us to seek justice in the European Court of Human Rights," O'Callaghan 
said.
"Ryanair is confident that the European Court of Human Rights will correct the obvious injustice caused by the 
French judicial system and allow Ryanair's employees working on Irish aircraft and on Irish contracts to continue to 
enjoy Ryanair's industry-leading pay and employment conditions under Irish law," he said.
Ryanair, which previously has accused France of seeking to protect Air France from foreign no-frills competition, 
does not recognize labor unions a policy that is an anathema to union-friendly France.
Ryanair suing France in Euro Court of Human Rights, hopes to avoid French labor laws
Ryanair operates at 20 French airports. Its complaint chiefly involves staff based at its hub in Marseilles, southern 
France, which was opened in 2006 with two Ryanair aircraft.

Aer Lingus threatens to suspend pilots if they don't accept new Belfast base

Aer Lingus Group PLC warned its pilots Wednesday that they will be suspended without pay unless they promise, 
in writing, to support the Irish airline's plans to open a Northern Ireland hub.
The surprise ultimatum raises the risk of disruptions at the airline, which is battling budget carrier Ryanair for 
supremacy in Ireland's skies.
The Impact union said it was advising members not to submit to the Monday deadline. Spokesman Niall Shanahan 
called the threat of mass suspensions "an act of madness."
But analysts said the previously state-owned airline, which has spent years seeking to boost efficiency and profits, 
appears to have reached the breaking point with union leaders, who have spent the past year opposing a cost-
saving plan.
The latest dispute concerns Aer Lingus' plans to open a new hub Dec. 10 at Belfast International Airport in the 
neighboring British territory of Northern Ireland.
Union leaders want staff there to receive the same union-negotiated working hours and benefits as in the Republic 
of Ireland and for existing staff to receive first consideration for the Belfast posts. But Aer Lingus insists it has the 
right to hire new staff under more flexible British terms of employment, and says pilots must help select and train 
new Northern Ireland-based pilots.
Pilots initially threatened to strike in response to the Belfast plan but backed off in August, after Aer Lingus had 
already been forced to cancel some flights and charter emergency aircraft from rival Ryanair.
Aer Lingus this week began suspending its approximately 30 elite pilots who hold instructors' qualifications. They've 
refused to take part in interviewing and training Northern Ireland-based pilots.
Wednesday's letter from Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion raised the stakes further, because it 
demanded a written promise of cooperation from all 450 of the airline's pilots.
Aer Lingus threatens to suspend pilots if they don't accept new Belfast base
Mannion wrote that it was "crucial that this base is set up with the unreserved cooperation of all Aer Lingus pilots."
"It is important that you understand that if you fail to confirm your willingness to unreservedly engage in your full 
range of duties ... you will be suspended from the payroll from 3 a.m. on Tuesday, 16th October 2007," Mannion 
wrote.
Aer Lingus has already confronted wider union forces by announcing last week it will withhold a previously 
promised 7.5 percent pay raise unless workers accept the company's latest cost-cutting plan. Union leaders insist 
that they must keep negotiating the terms of the plan.
