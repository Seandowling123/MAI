Budget airline Ryanair has reported record profits as its recession-resistant business model continues to attract 
passengers from higher-fare carriers.
The Dublin-based airline said Monday its full-year net profit for the fiscal year ending March 31 rose nearly 50 
percent to (EURO)560.4 million ($715 million), a record high for the business.
Sales rose 21 percent to (EURO)4.39 billion even though the number of passengers carried rose just 5 percent to 
75.8 million, reflecting higher average ticket prices. Fuel costs rose 30 percent to nearly (EURO)1.6 billion because 
of higher oil prices and Ryanair's continuing expansion of its route network and all-Boeing 737 fleet.
Reflecting the record profits, Ryanair says it plans to pay stockholders an exceptional dividend of (EURO)0.34 
($0.43) per share.

Industry seeks change but faces regulation and competition, writes Ross Tieman
Body
Much of Europe's aviation industry is caught in a vortex of seemingly-endless restructuring. No matter how much 
legacy airlines adapt, by the time they have reshaped, their operating environment has altered again, and new 
threats have emerged.
The 3,500 job cuts unveiled by Lufthansa on May 3 come against a dark horizon. The airline lost EUR381m in the 
first quarter of 2012. It expects an operating profit for the year, but is shedding 3 per cent of employees as part of a 
EUR1.5bn, three-year cost-cutting programme.
Air France-KLM has also launched a restructuring drive, designed to slash ex-fuel unit costs by 10 per cent, after a 
net loss of EUR809m in 2011.
And International Airlines Group (IAG) is seeking more work for less pay at its main Spanish arm Iberia, after 
winning a productivity deal at British Airways, newly enlarged by a takeover of former rival BMI which added take-off 
and landing slots at London's Heathrow.
Restructuring experts say Europe has too many airlines, competing in an imperfect market distorted by state 
involvement. They also face higher costs from dearer fuel, at a time of intensifying competition.
Airline profit margins tend to be slim. But the International Air Transport Association (Iata) forecasts that while those 
in Asia, North America, Latin America and the Middle East are likely to remain profitable in 2012 unless oil prices 
spike higher, European airlines collectively will lose EUR600m.
Roger de Peyrecave, leader of the airlines team at PwC, says: "A lot of pressures are converging on Europe's 
airlines in 2012 and beyond".
Partial liberalisation of the European Union aviation market has enabled low-cost airlines, led by Ryanair and 
easyJet, to undercut rivals on short and medium-haul routes.
Airlines flying into area of high pressure
Now fares on long-haul routes are under pressure from restructured North American carriers, and highly-efficient 
airlines based in the Arabian Gulf.
Gulf airlines, by operating only large, fuel-efficient wide body aircraft, benefit from low costs and have operating 
bases handily located midway between Europe and Asia.
Historically, the leading European former flag carriers used profits from long-haul routes to subsidise the short-haul 
flights that bring passengers to and from their long-haul hubs.
But as long-haul fares come under pressure, European carriers must try to reach the highest levels of efficiency on 
each kind of route they operate.
Philipp Goedeking, a managing director and aviation expert at corporate turnround specialist AlixPartners, says: "A 
big, and very rapid change, is going on in the European aviation market".
He identifies three main kinds of carrier among roughly 500 airlines in Europe.
The big full-service carriers have the scale to achieve efficiencies, but need to cut costs.
Partly because of historic agreements, they often pay higher salaries for lower productivity from staff than the 
second group, their big short and medium-haul low-cost rivals.
The third group comprises midsized flag carriers and a number of newish privately owned airlines. "There are many 
small unprofitable low-cost carriers, which in reality may be low-fare but certainly not low-cost," he says. "Airlines 
are scale-driven."
The difficulties of some of these under-scale companies, in a market where the European Commission is a vigilant 
opponent of state aid, are readily apparent. Two airlines, Spanair, backed by the state of Catalonia, and Malev, 
Hungary's state airline, have collapsed this year.
LOT in Poland and CSA Czech Airlines are among state airlines that are simultaneously striving to improve 
efficiency and find a partner.
Advisers and consultants are working with many companies to find a way forward.
Restructuring airlines is complicated, Mr Goedeking says. "You have to work with governments, renegotiate 
incentives, explore alliances and consolidation opportunities, and - in parallel - cut all possible costs."
Bigger carriers usually have only one reason to buy their smaller brethren. "You never buyanairline;you buy access 
to a market," Mr Goedeking says.
Buying and closing airlines within Europe removes rivals and triggers competition concerns.
This year, Etihad, a fast-growing Gulf carrier, lifted its stake in Air Berlin to 29 per cent and acquired a near-3 per 
cent stake in Aer Lingus of Ireland.
Tanja Wielgoss, head of aviation activities in central Europe for AT Kearney, a consultancy, says: "This is a first 
sign of the way things may go.
"Instead of negotiating traffic rights with each of the European states, Etihad now has access to a Europe-wide 
feeder service for its Abu Dhabi hub."
If Europe's big legacy carriers are to respond effectively, they need a new vision that their employees, who are 
often asked to work harder for less money, can share, she says.
"Moreover, their almost exclusive focus on the bottom line may not be enough in times when the business model is 
fundamentally challenged."
Airlines flying into area of high pressure
To thrive, European carriers will need to understand and provide what customers like, and are willing to pay for, she 
says.
But Ms Wielgoss also thinks governments should get out of the way. "It is time for national states to tear down the 
old system of traffic rights," she says.
"Passengers would benefit if there were real economies of scale. Travellers would be able to choose between 
clearly defined services and standards."

The June strike coincides with the Jubilee celebrations in Britain.
"Ryanair will operate a full schedule of flights to/from Stansted airport during the planned periods of disruption (23 -

The ISEQ closed a volatile week at its lowest point in months amid thin trading as investors awaited developments 
in the ongoing Greek and eurozone crisis.
The index fell 11.75 points to 3,014.26.
European stocks ended deep in red on Friday, with a key index hitting its lowest level in five months as mounting 
fears about the ability of Spain and Greece to deal with debts and fix their troubled banking sectors spooked 
investors.
Irish Continental Group (ICG) has issued an interim management statement for carryings up to May 12th and 
financial information for the first four months. As the statement indicates, ICG's business is significantly weighted 
towards the second half of the year when a higher proportion of operating profit is generated. In the period up to 
May 12th, passenger numbers were down 1.4pc on the previous year, with car volumes down 4.1pc but at higher 
yields. Over the same period, RoRo volumes were down 3.7pc, container freight volumes shipped decreased by 
5.9pc to 140,900 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units) and terminal lifts in Dublin and Belfast fell by 4.7pc year-on-
year. ICG's shares rose 14c to E15.23. Datalex also issued an IMS for the four months ending April 30th, 2012. The 
company performed strongly in the period, with growth in transaction revenue in the four months to April 2012 of 
more than 20pc compared to the same period in 2011. This is broadly in line with our expectations: we are 
forecasting FY 2012 transaction revenue up 21pc. This has been helped by the significant addition of new 
customers with eight new contracts signed last year. Transaction revenue should continue to gain momentum as 
more of these customers go live. The pipeline of customers includes Delta Airlines, Westjet, Malaysian Airlines and 
Garuda. The company has also gained a new customer in April - a major national carrier in Asia. Its shares climbed 
3c to E0.55. Independent News and Media (INM) has issued (May 18th) a first-half trading update covering the first 
19 weeks of the year, ending May 11th. Overall group revenues are marginally behind compared to our expectation

for the first half as a whole. However, cost reduction is running ahead of expectation and other than adjusting the 
mix slightly, we will not be making any change to numbers for the year. Davy continue to forecast group EBIT of 
E63.9m and diluted adjusted EPS of 8.0c. INM's shares dipped 1c to E0.27. Ryanair is due to release 2012 results 
on Monday. Goodbody are forecasting net income of E500m compared to the company's last guidance of E480m 
and consensus of E494m. Our forecasts imply a net loss of E58m in the final quarter (consensus E65.5m). We are 
looking for fares up 15pc for the full year and the final quarter. Last year, Michael O'Leary offered 12pc yield growth 
guidance for 2012, enough to cover rising fuel and deliver flat profits. That would equate to 9pc in 2013. "Bear in 
mind 2012 finished at 15pc compared with the initial guidance of 12pc (with net income finishing at E500m vs. 
E400m original guidance). We are forecasting 10.6pc yield growth in FY13, but the analysis we have done in this

The ISEQ plunged this morning amid talk of a bank run in Greece and fears of contagion spreading around Europe, 
including Ireland.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was down 33.81 points to 3,050.67.
European shares extended their losing streak as worries over Spanish lender Bankia caused its shares to fall more 
than 20 percent, hitting markets and adding to growing fears of contagion from Greece's economic crisis. The pan-
European FTSE 300 index was down 0.9 percent at 984.22 points by 1026 GMT, close to a 4-1/2 month low of 
983.95 points reached on Wednesday. Spain's benchmark IBEX index fell nearly 2 percent to its lowest level since 
mid-2003, as shares in Bankia slumped following a report in the El Mundo newspaper that its customers had 
withdrawn more than 1 billion euros from their accounts over the past week.
Paddy Power has issued a strong trading update that signals a continuation of very positive momentum across the 
business. Group net revenues are up 28pc year-to-date in constant currency terms, driven by 31pc growth in online 
revenue and 26pc growth in retail revenue. The revenue performance across all divisions remains ahead of Davy's 
expectations. In the core online business, sports-book net revenues are up 30pc year-to-date. This compares with 
the broker's forecast for H1 growth of 28pc, albeit the forecast includes Euro 2012 while clearly the year-to-date 
number does not. This suggests that an acceleration of growth is likely between now and the end of June, implying

The ISEQ plunged this morning amid talk of a bank run in Greece and fears of contagion spreading around Europe, 
including Ireland.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was down 33.81 points to 3,050.67.
European shares extended their losing streak as worries over Spanish lender Bankia caused its shares to fall more 
than 20 percent, hitting markets and adding to growing fears of contagion from Greece's economic crisis. The pan-
European FTSE 300 index was down 0.9 percent at 984.22 points by 1026 GMT, close to a 4-1/2 month low of 
983.95 points reached on Wednesday. Spain's benchmark IBEX index fell nearly 2 percent to its lowest level since 
mid-2003, as shares in Bankia slumped following a report in the El Mundo newspaper that its customers had 
withdrawn more than 1 billion euros from their accounts over the past week.
Paddy Power has issued a strong trading update that signals a continuation of very positive momentum across the 
business. Group net revenues are up 28pc year-to-date in constant currency terms, driven by 31pc growth in online 
revenue and 26pc growth in retail revenue. The revenue performance across all divisions remains ahead of Davy's 
expectations. In the core online business, sports-book net revenues are up 30pc year-to-date. This compares with 
the broker's forecast for H1 growth of 28pc, albeit the forecast includes Euro 2012 while clearly the year-to-date 
number does not. This suggests that an acceleration of growth is likely between now and the end of June, implying 
further potential upside to our revenue growth forecast. Gaming net revenues have grown 25pc year-to-date (Davy

Lufthansa 's Franz out to prove he is more than a costcutter
Lufthansa's Franz out to prove he is more than a costcutter

Byline: Andrew Parker and Ralph Atkins
Highlight: Interview
Christoph Franz
Chief executive, Lufthansa
Buying Transportes Aéreos Portugueses will be considered, say Andrew Parker and Ralph Atkins
Body
Christoph Franz is seeking to bring some order to the sprawling empire created by his predecessors.
Lufthansa's chief executive is busy selling assets and cutting costs at Europe's largest airline by revenue after it 
slipped to a EUR13m net loss in 2011 , his first year in charge.
The eurozone crisis, high fuel costs and intense competition took their toll, as well as regulatory decisions led by the 
ban on night flights at Frankfurt airport, the German airline's cargo and passenger hub.
"The night-flight ban - that is the German equivalent of not creating a third runway in Heathrow," says Mr Franz, in a 
light-hearted but ultimately serious comparison with how the UK government has angered British airlines.
While Mr Franz is powerless to overturn the night-flight ban at Frankfurt that will reduce Lufthansa's annual 
earnings by EUR40m, he is starting to take some drastic steps to improve profitability.
BMI British Midland, the lossmaking UK airline that Lufthansa took control of in 2009, was sold last month to 
International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways.
BMI has struggled on multiple fronts and Lufthansa blamed the EUR199m operating loss for pushing the group into 
the red last year. Mr Franz insists that Lufthansa was always going to find it difficult to challenge IAG at Heathrow - 
even though BMI has the second-largest portfolio of take-off and landing slots at the capacity-constrained airport 
after BA.
Lufthansa 's Franz out to prove he is more than a costcutter
"Though it's an important portfolio, it's still too small with regard to market share," he says.
He should know when to cut and run because the 52-year-old is well-versed in restructuring. He was involved in 
Lufthansa's turnround following the first Gulf war, when he served in the office of Jürgen Weber, the then chief 
executive.
In 2004 he became chief executive of Swiss International Air Lines, where he cut costs before its acquisition by 
Lufthansa.
The restructuring now being implemented at Austrian Airlines, which Lufthansa bought in 2009, has parallels with 
what happened at Swiss.
Austrian ran up a EUR62m operating loss in 2011 and the airline's pilots were told last month that they must 
transfer to Tyrolean Airways, a regional airline controlled by the Austrian flag carrier.
The pilots face having to work longer hours and are being asked to switch from attractive final-salary pensions to 
less lucrative defined-contribution schemes.
But Mr Franz's restructuring skills may well find their severest test in Lufthansa's home market of Germany.
Air Berlin, easyJet and Ryanair, the low-cost carriers, are encroaching on Lufthansa's short-haul routes, while Gulf 
airlines led by Emirates are putting pressure on long-distance flights between Germany and Asia.
Mr Franz is seeking to fight back against the budget airlines by stripping out duplication between Lufthansa's point-
to-point short-haul services and Germanwings, the group's German low-cost carrier, which suffered a EUR52m 
operating loss in 2011.
With greater co-ordination, he is hoping that the group can maximise profitability through Lufthansa's premium fares 
and Germanwings' low-cost structure. If not, he suggests Lufthansa could decide to abandon its premium brand 
positioning on short-haul routes.
That decision may be accelerated by the probable rejuvenation of Air Berlin, the lossmaking German airline that last 
year secured Etihad, the deep-pocketed Abu Dhabi carrier, as its largest investor.
Mr Franz complains that Lufthansa is not competing on a level playing field with the Gulf carriers, highlighting how 
these state-controlled airlines benefit from government-funded hub airport infrastructure.
But he sees little or no chance of any redress. "The [European] airlines are fairly weak to defend their interests," he 
says.
While he may have to spend much of his time improving Lufthansa's efficiency in the face of a competitive 
onslaught, Mr Franz is keen not to be seen simply as a costcutter.
He says he is willing to consider deals, albeit in a more cautious manner than his predecessors, and will examine 
the case for buying Transportes Aéreos Portugueses, the Portuguese carrier that is a leading European provider of 
flights to Brazil.
"Buying airlines is . . . exciting," he says.

It has been a challenging start to the year for Spanish airlines, with the collapse of long-establish Spanair, the 
launch of - and industrial tension around - Iberia's new Madrid short-haul airline, and continued concern about the 
country's economy.
The fall of Spanair at the end of January, despite its well-documented financial difficulties, was still sudden. The 
Barcelona-based Star Alliance carrier had to suspend flights on 27 January after talks with Qatar Airways over a 
cash-for-shares deal collapsed. With the Catalan regional government making clear that Spanair could expect no 
further loans from the authorities, the airline ran out of avenues to secure much-needed investment. Spanair had 
racked up operating losses of more than $400 million between 2006 and 2009.
Spanair, which operated a fleet of 29 aircraft, carrying around seven million passengers annually, was one of three 
significant operations out of Barcelona's El Prat airport. Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling, which has grown strongly 
since its merger with fellow Barcelona-based operator Clickair in 2009, was joined by Irish budget carrier Ryanair at 
the Catalan capital's main airport in 2010. It was one of four Spanish bases Ryanair opened that year as the no-frills 
carrier pushed into the country, encouraged by Spanish efforts to bolster tourism by cutting airport fees.
Vueling was quick to step in and mop up routes vacated by Spanair, and chief executive Alex Cruz expects to 
benefit from further consolidation. "I can't see how the market will continue with current fuel prices without further 
consolidation and we plan to take advantage of that," Cruz told analysts at its 2011 annual results conference call 
earlier this year. Vueling, which lifted net profits to E10.4 million ($14 million) in 2011, could grow capacity by up to 
a quarter this year. It also hopes to make a decision on an order for around 30 aircraft in the summer.
Iberia holds a 46% stake in Vueling - having been one of the original shareholders in Clickair - and, under a wet-
lease deal, used the Barcelona-based low-cost carrier as a stop-gap solution to its problems on short-haul routes

out of Madrid. In common with most European network carriers, Iberia had found its short-haul operations 
increasingly unprofitable amid tougher competition.
loss of patience
Following Iberia's merger with British Airways, the boss of its parent company International Airlines Group (IAG), 
Willie Walsh, made overhauling Iberia's short-haul operation a priority. And after loss of patience with Iberia's 
unions, the answer was to establish a separate operation, Iberia Express.
"What we have at Iberia is a cost base that is too high and that the trade unions have refused to address," said a 
determined Walsh, days before Iberia Express launched in late March. "So the response to that situation is for the 
company to establish Iberia Express. We are determined that it will expand its operations in the way we have 
outlined. There is no credible alternative to Iberia Express."
Iberia Express launched operations on 25 March, using four Airbus A320s operating on domestic routes to Alicante, 
Malaga, Mallorca and Seville from its Madrid Barajas base. Its first international services, to Dublin and Naples, 
follow in June. It expects to operate 13 A320s by the end of the year, and three more next year. "We have worked 
more than two years on this project," says Iberia's chief executive Rafael Sánchez-Lozano. "Iberia Express is key to 
Iberia. We have to ensure profitability on short- and medium-[haul] routes."
It effectively means Iberia's second launch of a low-cost operator in six years. Like Clickair, which launched in 
October 2006, Iberia Express will focus on costs. The new carrier aims to save E100 million ($132 million) by 2015. 
Its fleet is sourced from Iberia.
"Iberia Express will have the same philosophy as Clickair," says Iberia Express chief executive Luis Gallego. "We 
want an airline that works as fast as Clickair and has the same punctuality. We want to create a model that will be 
self-efficient and eventually will not have to rely on subsidiaries."
Iberia Express will mainly address domestic routes as parent company Iberia builds on connecting traffic at the 
Madrid hub. According to Sánchez-Lozano, 70% of long-haul flights are connecting flights.
little overlap
The launch of Iberia Express will not affect the operations of Iberia regional operator Air Nostrum or Vueling, says 
Sánchez-Lozano. "Air Nostrum has a franchise agreement with Iberia and tends to operate smaller aircraft on 
smaller routes. It will continue to play an important role for Iberia."
He adds: "There could be some routes overlapping with Vueling but it [Iberia Express] has a different business 
model. Vueling is not aimed at linking a network and operates point-to point routes from Barcelona."
But if the vision is clear, the birth has not been so, as labour protests continue. Iberia pilots held 12 stoppages 
between December 2011 and March 2012 - costing the airline an estimated E36 million - in protest at the creation 
of Iberia Express, which Spanish pilots union SEPLA says undermines the job security and working conditions of its 
members.
But the dispute entered a new phase in April, when 150 Iberia flights were grounded in the first of 30 additional one-
day strikes that will now be repeated every Monday and Friday until July.
"The productivity of Iberia pilots is the lowest in Spain," the airline argues. "They fly an average of 650 hours per 
year, compared with the 900 the law permits."
Though Iberia's bargaining agreements impose a limit of 820 hours on short-haul fleets and 850 hours on long-haul 
ones, additional conditions and restrictions mean that pilots never reach these limits. "Without eliminating these 
conditions and restrictions, it would be impossible to increase productivity to a level near that of competing airlines," 
the airline insists.
The pain in spainSpanish bombs; Spanair's collapse and Iberia's efforts to overhaul short-haul operations at 
Madrid through Iberia Express, has sent shockwaves ....
SEPLA claims that up to 8,000 jobs will be put at risk if the parent company starts moving short and medium-haul 
capacity from the full-service carrier to its low-cost subsidiary. The pilots' union says it has drawn up its own cost-
cutting plans to save the company E90 million per year, mainly through lower salaries for new hires.
Tensions were stoked further when Iberia announced it will cut pilot payroll expenses by 20% while demanding a 
25% increase in productivity. Resolving the profitability of Iberia's short-haul operation is a crucial part in turning 
round the fortunes of Iberia, the financial performance of which - full-year results for IAG clearly illustrate - is lagging 
behind its partner, British Airways. The UK airline generated an operating profit of E592 million in 2011, compared 
with losses of E61 million by Iberia in the same period.
These differing fortunes in part reflect the relatively robust business climate that has remained in London, even with 
a slow economy. Spanish economic woes, though, have continued. Spain is back in recession and concerns over 
its debt crisis remain.
An appetite for the airline business still exists in the country. Spanish investors - including Vueling founders Carlos 
Muñoz and Lázaro Ros - have launched one of the only new airlines in Europe in recent years. Ambitious start-up 
Volotea has just launched flights initially out of Venice, but it will open a summer operating base in Ibiza and begin 
serving the Balearic Islands in the middle of June.

Landing at Seville's San Pablo airport is a similar experience to that encountered when visiting any number of 
European cities, with EasyJet and Ryanair among the airlines running regular services to the location, along with 
Spanish low-cost specialist Vueling and the recently-established Iberia Express.
What makes the location unique can be seen on the southern side of its single runway, where several massive new 
hangars dominate the skyline. The ramp outside is dotted with a variety of military transport aircraft, ranging in size 
from Airbus Military's diminutive C-212, flown around the globe for almost 40 years, up to the A400M "Grizzly", 
which is less than 12 months away from entering use.
The reason for choosing Spain's fourth-largest city to house the final assembly line (FAL) for Europe's new-
generation military airlifter stems from the nation's rich heritage in this sector, which was built by the then-CASA 
company. It also reflects a strong desire by parent company EADS to establish a new airlift centre of excellence in 
Seville, with support and financial backing also coming from the Andalucian authorities.
Major investment in the San Pablo site has included the construction of assembly lines for both the A400M and 
Airbus Military's light and medium transports, plus flight-test facilities, a paint shop and a major international training 
centre (see box, P34).
production focus
The signature in May 2003 of a development and production contract for an original 180 aircraft was the catalyst for 
creating the facility for completing the A400M. Major structures arrive aboard Airbus A300-600ST Beluga 
transports, with five development examples having been flown and the first two production aircraft now on the line.
Production should hit its planned maximum rate of 30 per year during 2015, with deliveries to be made to launch 
nations Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK, plus export buyer Malaysia.
The airbus effect Its military transport heritage helped Seville secure the A400M final assembly line, delivering 
jobs and skills and providing a lift for Airbu....
While the new aircraft is the largest to have been assembled in Seville, the expertise required to run the line draws 
in no small part from Airbus Military's success with the C-212, CN-235 and C-295. These are completed in a 
spacious hangar just behind that built for the larger type, and where the effects of a new transformation programme 
are beginning to have a major impact.
November 2013 will bring the 30th anniversary of the CN-235's first flight, while its stretched-fuselage and re-
engined C-295 stablemate made its debut sortie in 1998. A combined 375 of the twin-turboprops have now been 
sold, including 100 of the newer design, accounting for more than one-third of Airbus Military's total of 1,060-plus 
transports.
The company's production rate for the light and medium types averaged 18 per year between 2007 and 2011, a 
period during which it also expanded the number of special mission variants on offer. These now include maritime 
patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft, plus an airborne early warning and control system version being offered 
to a prospective launch customer with Israeli partner Elta Systems.
With multiple versions of the CN-235 and C-295 typically to be found in the facility's four work stations and with 
parts arriving from locations including Chile, Indonesia, Poland, Portugal and Turkey, Airbus Military faced a serious 
challenge in managing its production flow, says Ricardo Rojas, head of the FAL for light and medium products.
"Every station is organised like a small factory, with logistics and control," Rojas says. "We have to manage the 
workload, with a tack-time of 10 days to move to the next position." Each station on the pulse line has between 40 
to 50 people working on it, depending on the version of aircraft being completed. "It's very difficult to manage that," 
he says. "You need to have flexibility in your people."
Two shifts of about 300 people each work on the light and medium FAL, with its total staffing level being around 
700.
The company has recently established a basic reference group (GBR) model, under which all C-295s will be 
manufactured with certain equipment and wiring installed. This will enable any aircraft to be adapted for tasks 
beyond the air transport mission from a wide range of options. As a result, Rojas says the time needed to 
accommodate such requests can be cut by up to 30% for some versions, with the step also reducing costs. A 
further 10% saving could follow, along with reduced non-recurring costs for new versions.
sales target
The first aircraft to have been completed using the new model was delivered to Ghana last month, the 87th C-295 
produced. While it will split production equally between the type and the CN-235 this year, largely because of a 
follow-on French order for the smaller model, under current plans only three CN-235s are likely to be completed in 
2013.
With the production model transformed, Airbus Military is stepping up its efforts to boost the current build rate. "At 
18 a year we are in a comfort zone, but we aim to increase deliveries up to 25," says Jerónimo Amador, head of 
market development for light and medium transport aircraft. "The production line is ready for that."
The target is to deliver 20 per year for the next three years, with sales opportunities including an Indian air force 
deal to replace 56 Hawker Siddeley 748 transports. The company is also looking to broaden the variety of special 
mission variants of the C-295 that it can offer to its existing and new customers. In all, Amador says Airbus Military 
aims to sell about 215 aircraft between 2012 and 2021.
Beyond the new efficiency being enjoyed by customers of the medium transport, the GBR transformation has 
already had an impact on the A400M. An initial 15 personnel from the light and medium FAL were transferred in 
January to work on the new project, another 25 will follow during November.
The airbus effect Its military transport heritage helped Seville secure the A400M final assembly line, delivering 
jobs and skills and providing a lift for Airbu....
Work on the A400M line is now focused on completing assembly of the first of at least 172 production aircraft. To be 
delivered to the French air force around the end of this year, MSN7 is in the Station 35 position undergoing system 
tests before having its Europrop International TP400-D6 engines installed. First flight will occur "during the 
summer", Airbus Military says.
All parts for aircraft MSN8, France's second of 50 A400Ms, are already in the hangar, with assembly work due to 
commence soon. The next aircraft, to be put together from early next year, will be delivered to the Turkish air force.
Airbus Military's workforce in Seville has been sourced from within the region. "The employees are local people," 
Rojas says. "We are always measuring their skills and launching training to get the level that we want." A new 
assessment process for all members of staff this year will define the skills required to perform each type of job.
New assembly-line staff receive instruction in Andalucia, where an aeronautical engineering degree course is now 
available in Seville, before arriving as specialists in areas such as electrics or mechanics. On-the-job training will 
enable them to broaden their expertise, which Rojas says is vital for the long-term: "In the future we want people 
who are capable of doing everything."
The company is studying whether to also introduce the GBR concept with the CN-235, but a decision will be driven 
by its future orders intake.
One possibility is that further development could be performed in partnership with PT Dirgantara Indonesia, using a 
model already being introduced with the C-212. All parts for the -400 version are already made in Indonesia, and 
Airbus Military is preparing to assemble its last-ever example in Spain. Components are due to arrive in San Pablo 
during June, with the transport to be delivered to Thailand in December. All subsequent examples will be completed 
in Indonesia.
"We are now analysing the potential for an aircraft in the C-212 category," Amador says, identifying the need to 
support commercial operators flying on "pioneer routes" to remote parts of Indonesia. "We believe the C-212 is still 
a good product for this utility market."
A long-term partner to Airbus Military and CASA before it, Jakarta also signed a February order for nine C-295s, the 
last two of which should be assembled in the customer nation.
Although it was first flown 14 years ago, Amador says the C-295's sales performance to date, and its growing range 
of special mission applications, mean Airbus Military is in no hurry to launch work on a "C-2XX" successor, but it 
continually assesses the market need.
"Our view is that the C-295 with continued development is a solid product for the next 15 to 20 years," he says. "We 
don't see now a significant need for a new development."

INTERNATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE WELCOMES ALL-COMERS
The airbus effect Its military transport heritage helped Seville secure the A400M final assembly line, delivering 
jobs and skills and providing a lift for Airbu....
AS PRODUCTION aircraft MSN7 takes shape on the A400M final assembly line, Airbus Military is also working to 
ready the training system which will prepare the first pilots and loadmasters to operate Europe's new-generation 
airlifter.
With the first aircraft due to be delivered to the French air force around the end of this year, the company is making 
preparations to begin training the service's first four pilots, up to six loadmasters and maintainers using the 
international training centre (ITC) at its San Pablo site near Seville.
Opened in October 2010 and already supporting customers for Airbus Military's light and medium transports, the 
12,000m2 (130,000ft2) facility has 22 training rooms and will eventually house six full-flight simulators, including at 
least one for the A400M.
"We plan to complete training on the first two French air force crews before the end of this year," says Ian Burrett, 
Airbus Military's head of training and aircrew operations. "We have got a lot to do in the next seven months, but are 
very much on track to do that."
The first equipment needed to deliver the course is nearing readiness, with a computer-based training system now 
going through validation testing.
Procedural and maintenance trainers will follow, with a Thales-built full-flight simulator to be in use around August 
but only able to support operations from about the end of the year. To enter use as a Level C device, the simulator 
will later be certificated to the Level D standard, potentially enabling pilots to achieve a zero flight-time conversion to 
the A400M.
A CAE cockpit-maintenance trainer will also enter use in August, and a Rheinmetall-produced cargo hold trainer will 
be available from March 2013. The latter will support loadmaster instruction, including for applications such as 
airdrop.
With the initial work for France to be at its most intensive between October and December, the company will employ 
other assets, including its "aircraft zero" systems simulator and production-standard development aircraft MSN6.
Early training for all A400M nations will be conducted using the ITC. In-country facilities will follow for the French air 
force and UK Royal Air Force at their Orléans and Brize Norton bases, with Germany yet to announce the location 
for its domestic infrastructure. Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain will send personnel to Seville, while Turkey's plans 
are yet to be confirmed.
The annual throughput at the ITC is about 1,000 people, including pilots, maintainers and mission system operators 
from nations including Chile, Egypt and Indonesia, who can also learn in Seville while using their own aircraft.
"Once at full speed on the A400M it will probably be around 2,000," Burrett says. "The students also learn from 
each other, which is a real benefit of a multinational programme."

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) called on Transport Minister Leo Varadkar to break-up the 
DAA monopoly and free it from the dead hand of the Dept of Transport protection after Dublin airport failed to meet 
EU security standards, which means that all aircraft and passengers departing from Dublin airport must undergo 
similar security check at destination airports as if they were flying from Middle Eastern or third world countries with 
known security or terrorism risks.
Ryanair noted that all aircraft and passengers departing from Dublin may now undergo segregation and additional 
security checks upon arrival due to the failure of the DAA and its downtown office the Dept of Transport to comply 
with European security minima.

Spanair's collapse and Iberia's efforts to overhaul short-haul operations at Madrid through Iberia Express, has sent 
shockwaves through Spain's airline market
It has been a challenging start to the year for Spanish airlines, with the collapse of long-establish Spanair, the

Its military transport heritage helped Seville secure the A400M final assembly line, delivering jobs and skills and 
providing a lift for Airbus Military's other products
Landing at Seville's San Pablo airport is a similar experience to that encountered when visiting any number of 
European cities, with EasyJet and Ryanair among the airlines running regular services to the location, along with 
Spanish low-cost specialist Vueling and the recently-established Iberia Express.
What makes the location unique can be seen on the southern side of its single runway, where several massive new 
hangars dominate the skyline. The ramp outside is dotted with a variety of military transport aircraft, ranging in size 
from Airbus Military's diminutive C-212, flown around the globe for almost 40 years, up to the A400M "Grizzly", 
which is less than 12 months away from entering use.
The reason for choosing Spain's fourth-largest city to house the final assembly line (FAL) for Europe's new-
generation military airlifter stems from the nation's rich heritage in this sector, which was built by the then-CASA 
company. It also reflects a strong desire by parent company EADS to establish a new airlift centre of excellence in 
Seville, with support and financial backing also coming from the Andalucian authorities.
Major investment in the San Pablo site has included the construction of assembly lines for both the A400M and 
Airbus Military's light and medium transports, plus flight-test facilities, a paint shop and a major international training 
centre (see box, P34).
PRODUCTION FOCUS
The signature in May 2003 of a development and production contract for an original 180 aircraft was the catalyst for 
creating the facility for completing the A400M. Major structures arrive aboard Airbus A300-600ST Beluga 
transports, with five development examples having been flown and the first two production aircraft now on the line.
Production should hit its planned maximum rate of 30 per year during 2015, with deliveries to be made to launch 
nations Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK, plus export buyer Malaysia.

While the new aircraft is the largest to have been assembled in Seville, the expertise required to run the line draws 
in no small part from Airbus Military's success with the C-212, CN-235 and C-295. These are completed in a 
spacious hangar just behind that built for the larger type, and where the effects of a new transformation programme 
are beginning to have a major impact.
November 2013 will bring the 30th anniversary of the CN-235's first flight, while its stretched-fuselage and re-
engined C-295 stablemate made its debut sortie in 1998. A combined 375 of the twin-turboprops have now been 
sold, including 100 of the newer design, accounting for more than one-third of Airbus Military's total of 1,060-plus 
transports.
The company's production rate for the light and medium types averaged 18 per year between 2007 and 2011, a 
period during which it also expanded the number of special mission variants on offer. These now include maritime 
patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft, plus an airborne early warning and control system version being offered 
to a prospective launch customer with Israeli partner Elta Systems.
With multiple versions of the CN-235 and C-295 typically to be found in the facility's four work stations and with 
parts arriving from locations including Chile, Indonesia, Poland, Portugal and Turkey, Airbus Military faced a serious 
challenge in managing its production flow, says Ricardo Rojas, head of the FAL for light and medium products.
"Every station is organised like a small factory, with logistics and control," Rojas says. "We have to manage the 
workload, with a tack-time of 10 days to move to the next position." Each station on the pulse line has between 40 
to 50 people working on it, depending on the version of aircraft being completed. "It's very difficult to manage that," 
he says. "You need to have flexibility in your people."
Two shifts of about 300 people each work on the light and medium FAL, with its total staffing level being around 
700.
The company has recently established a basic reference group (GBR) model, under which all C-295s will be 
manufactured with certain equipment and wiring installed. This will enable any aircraft to be adapted for tasks 
beyond the air transport mission from a wide range of options. As a result, Rojas says the time needed to 
accommodate such requests can be cut by up to 30% for some versions, with the step also reducing costs. A 
further 10% saving could follow, along with reduced non-recurring costs for new versions.
SALES TARGET
The first aircraft to have been completed using the new model was delivered to Ghana last month, the 87th C-295 
produced. While it will split production equally between the type and the CN-235 this year, largely because of a 
follow-on French order for the smaller model, under current plans only three CN-235s are likely to be completed in 
2013.
With the production model transformed, Airbus Military is stepping up its efforts to boost the current build rate. "At 
18 a year we are in a comfort zone, but we aim to increase deliveries up to 25," says Jerónimo Amador, head of 
market development for light and medium transport aircraft. "The production line is ready for that."
The target is to deliver 20 per year for the next three years, with sales opportunities including an Indian air force 
deal to replace 56 Hawker Siddeley 748 transports. The company is also looking to broaden the variety of special 
mission variants of the C-295 that it can offer to its existing and new customers. In all, Amador says Airbus Military 
aims to sell about 215 aircraft between 2012 and 2021.
Beyond the new efficiency being enjoyed by customers of the medium transport, the GBR transformation has 
already had an impact on the A400M. An initial 15 personnel from the light and medium FAL were transferred in 
January to work on the new project, another 25 will follow during November.
Work on the A400M line is now focused on completing assembly of the first of at least 172 production aircraft. To be 
delivered to the French air force around the end of this year, MSN7 is in the Station 35 position undergoing system 
No Headline In Original
tests before having its Europrop International TP400-D6 engines installed. First flight will occur "during the 
summer", Airbus Military says.
All parts for aircraft MSN8, France's second of 50 A400Ms, are already in the hangar, with assembly work due to 
commence soon. The next aircraft, to be put together from early next year, will be delivered to the Turkish air force.
Airbus Military's workforce in Seville has been sourced from within the region. "The employees are local people," 
Rojas says. "We are always measuring their skills and launching training to get the level that we want." A new 
assessment process for all members of staff this year will define the skills required to perform each type of job.
New assembly-line staff receive instruction in Andalucia, where an aeronautical engineering degree course is now 
available in Seville, before arriving as specialists in areas such as electrics or mechanics. On-the-job training will 
enable them to broaden their expertise, which Rojas says is vital for the long-term: "In the future we want people 
who are capable of doing everything."
The company is studying whether to also introduce the GBR concept with the CN-235, but a decision will be driven 
by its future orders intake.
One possibility is that further development could be performed in partnership with PT Dirgantara Indonesia, using a 
model already being introduced with the C-212. All parts for the -400 version are already made in Indonesia, and 
Airbus Military is preparing to assemble its last-ever example in Spain. Components are due to arrive in San Pablo 
during June, with the transport to be delivered to Thailand in December. All subsequent examples will be completed 
in Indonesia.
"We are now analysing the potential for an aircraft in the C-212 category," Amador says, identifying the need to 
support commercial operators flying on "pioneer routes" to remote parts of Indonesia. "We believe the C-212 is still 
a good product for this utility market."
A long-term partner to Airbus Military and CASA before it, Jakarta also signed a February order for nine C-295s, the 
last two of which should be assembled in the customer nation.
Although it was first flown 14 years ago, Amador says the C-295's sales performance to date, and its growing range 
of special mission applications, mean Airbus Military is in no hurry to launch work on a "C-2XX" successor, but it 
continually assesses the market need.
"Our view is that the C-295 with continued development is a solid product for the next 15 to 20 years," he says. "We 
don't see now a significant need for a new development."
First flown in Seville in 2010, A400M development aircraft "Grizzly 2" shone in recent high-altitude tests in Bolivia
The C-295 is now offered as an airborne early-warning asset

INTERNATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE WELCOMES ALL-COMERS
AS PRODUCTION aircraft MSN7 takes shape on the A400M final assembly line, Airbus Military is also working to 
ready the training system which will prepare the first pilots and loadmasters to operate Europe's new-generation 
airlifter.
With the first aircraft due to be delivered to the French air force around the end of this year, the company is making 
preparations to begin training the service's first four pilots, up to six loadmasters and maintainers using the 
international training centre (ITC) at its San Pablo site near Seville.
No Headline In Original
Opened in October 2010 and already supporting customers for Airbus Military's light and medium transports, the 
12,000m2 (130,000ft2) facility has 22 training rooms and will eventually house six full-flight simulators, including at 
least one for the A400M.
"We plan to complete training on the first two French air force crews before the end of this year," says Ian Burrett, 
Airbus Military's head of training and aircrew operations. "We have got a lot to do in the next seven months, but are 
very much on track to do that."
The first equipment needed to deliver the course is nearing readiness, with a computer-based training system now 
going through validation testing.
Procedural and maintenance trainers will follow, with a Thales-built full-flight simulator to be in use around August 
but only able to support operations from about the end of the year. To enter use as a Level C device, the simulator 
will later be certificated to the Level D standard, potentially enabling pilots to achieve a zero flight-time conversion to 
the A400M.
A CAE cockpit-maintenance trainer will also enter use in August, and a Rheinmetall-produced cargo hold trainer will 
be available from March 2013. The latter will support loadmaster instruction, including for applications such as 
airdrop.
With the initial work for France to be at its most intensive between October and December, the company will employ 
other assets, including its "aircraft zero" systems simulator and production-standard development aircraft MSN6.
Early training for all A400M nations will be conducted using the ITC. In-country facilities will follow for the French air 
force and UK Royal Air Force at their Orléans and Brize Norton bases, with Germany yet to announce the location 
for its domestic infrastructure. Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain will send personnel to Seville, while Turkey's plans 
are yet to be confirmed.
The annual throughput at the ITC is about 1,000 people, including pilots, maintainers and mission system operators 
from nations including Chile, Egypt and Indonesia, who can also learn in Seville while using their own aircraft.
"Once at full speed on the A400M it will probably be around 2,000," Burrett says. "The students also learn from 
each other, which is a real benefit of a multinational programme."

Aer Lingus now flying highest in Dublin

Aer Lingus has overtaken its largest shareholder, Ryanair, as the biggest carrier at Dublin Airport, according to 
passenger traffic data seen by *The Sunday Business Post*.
Aer Lingus has performed strongly at Dublin in the early months of 2012, showing a near 8 per cent rise to the end 
of February compared to the same period in 2011.
It carried more than 920,000 passengers during the period and has continued to perform strongly since, according 
to sources.
Ryanair's Dublin traffic for the first two months fell to 913,000, down almost 13 per cent compared to the same 
period in 2011. It has regularly attacked what it says are higher charges at Dublin Airport. Analysts say that the 
airline has moved from a long period of aggressive growth to one of consolidation right across its network.
The Dublin Airport Authority traffic figures show that overall traffic fell 4 per cent in the early months of 2012 
compared to 2011. The figures also reveal that Dublin's new Terminal Two is outperforming its projected share of 
total traffic. It now caters for more than 45 per cent of passengers through the airport despite projections it would 
cater for 35 per cent.
Much of the airport's highest value traffic, particularly transatlantic flights, is routed through Terminal 2. A number of 
high-profile airlines using the terminal, apart from Aer Lingus, have also gained strongly, according to the 
passenger traffic data. Etihad has increased its traffic by 16 per cent, Emirates is a new arrival and domestic carrier 
Aer Arann is up 24 per cent in the early months of the year.
Other carriers in Terminal One apart from Ryanair have also lost traffic, including Air France, down 11 per cent, and 
TUI, down 25 per cent.
Aer Lingus now flying highest in Dublin
The Dublin Airport Authority last week announced to staff a voluntary redundancy programme for up to 150 staff, 
largely in Terminal One. Decreasing traffic is only part of the reason the redundancies are focused on Terminal 
One, with wage rates up to 30 per cent higher in the older facility than in Terminal Two, according to sources.
"DAA has suffered a very significant fall in passenger traffic and commercial spends," information given to staff by 
the company explaining the redundancy programme said. "Passenger traffic in 2012 is expected to remain below 
2005 levels. Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports incurred losses during 2011.
"Cost reduction has not kept pace with revenue falls and traffic declines and operating costs in certain areas of the 
business remain well in excess of those at peer airports. The scale of losses at our airports is unsustainable and is 
not consistent with DAA's commercial mandate."

When German software firm SAP announced earlier this month that it is to create 250 new jobs in Dublin and 
Galway, it emerged that 150 of them will be in the areas of sales and services.
The move reflects what IT industry sources say is an increased confidence among some firms that are now 
comfortable about spending on improving their systems after several years of consolidation and, in many cases, 
downsizing.
While SAP's software is used by some of the country's largest firms, including AIB and Ryanair, it also has a large 
and growing number of SME customers here which use its SAP Business One programme.
According to Morgan Browne, managing director of Intelligent Information Systems -- one of SAP's largest partners 
in Ireland and Britain -- demand for the programme has risen sharply over the past few months.
"We're seeing a scenario now where people are spending because they don't want to have to hire staff," Browne 
said. "They've cut their business back over the past number of years to manage the recession, but now they're 
starting to grow again. Instead of hiring someone new to help them do that, they're looking for new systems to help 
grow the business.
"We've seen massive growth in the Irish market over the past six to nine months, and we believe that will continue; 
the pipeline is still very strong, and there are more and more companies that are coming on-stream all the time. 
Obviously that's not the case across all sectors -- construction is still dead, for example -- but if you look at areas 
like manufacturing, distribution, there is definitely a lot of business out there."
SAP Business One is an integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) system which is used by over 30,000 
customers around the world. Its functions include automating financial and accounting processes, customer 
relationship management, and warehouse and production management.
ERP: Software firms turn the corner
According to Browne, the system is suitable for companies with employee numbers ranging from just a handful to 
around 200. "One of its key benefits is that it's a pre-templated solution," he said.
"That means that it can be deployed very rapidly, but it also means it is a much more affordable ERP solution for a 
large number of companies. We've been working with it since 2003, and we've deployed it in most industries at this 
stage. Even though it's pre-templated, it is still very flexible because of the applications that can be added on, and 
that can be tailored to different needs."
According to Browne, SAP Business One's users tend to fall into two categories. "First of all you've got companies 
who are starting up who need a solution now, or who will need one in a year or two because their process are 
complex and require some significant traceability," he said.
"Then you have slightly larger SMEs which have expanded but are currently using multiple applications that aren't 
tied together, and now want to bring everything under one application, rather than having a series of disparate 
systems."
For both of these customer groups, the ability to save money and make their businesses more efficient is one of the 
main attractions of the software.
"But they're not the only ones," he said. "You will also have better visibility because your data is stored in one 
location and you no longer have to worry about managing multiple systems. Integration is also becoming a key 
issue for a lot of people.
"They want cloud-based solutions as well as on-premises solutions. They're looking for mobility so that they can 
make decisions on the road, they're looking at integration with other applications, they want to be able to offer self-
service for their customers online. These are some of the main reasons why customers are investing at the 
moment."
According to Browne, the applications that are currently being developed for SAP Business One can now meet 
those needs.
"Because of what's possible with the applications, companies are able to empower their staff on the road. The 
mobility that's now available through the applications lets them view their business partner information and process 
their transactions through their iPad," he said.
"And then of course you've got analytics in the cloud as well, so the applications enable staff to have visibility of 
information remotely. There's been a lot of pent-up demand in Ireland in recent years. There are a lot of companies 
who need this kind of product, and have needed it for a while now, but they've been putting it off because of the 
recession. Now they are feeling a bit more confident about making that move."
According to Browne, the software can be deployed in as little as 20 days, but the actual time it will take will depend 
on how complicated the business is, and the level of resources that are available internally.
For companies currently running older, less integrated systems, contemplating a move can seem a little daunting, 
especially at a time when many business budgets are still under pressure.
But Browne said that, in some cases, the cost of managing some of those legacy systems could be considerably 
higher than a fresher solution.
"There are people out there who have systems running on non-supported software who are now in a situation 
where they feel the need to upgrade. On average, they can be up and running with something like SAP Business 
One within three months. When you consider the savings they could make, that's not a lot of time," he said.

Laws of aerodynamics demand that forward forces offset drag for flight to be possible. Executives at easyJet seem 
to have taken the lesson on board. In spite of a 26 per cent increase in first-half fuel costs - an extra £100m, year 
on year - the low-cost carrier posted a sharply reduced pre-tax loss of £112m, down from a £153m deficit in the first 
six months of 2011. True, this was helped by a much milder winter and so reduced weather-related costs: lost flight 
segments were about a 10th of the previous year's figure. But revenue per seat was almost 12 per cent higher, 
while seat numbers nudged up 3.5 per cent. Result: a near 16 per cent jump in revenues.
The path ahead remains tricky, though. The second half last year saw changes to booking fees, priority boarding 
and bag charges, so revenue comparisons will become tougher. Competitor capacity, which was constrained over 
the winter, could become slightly less disciplined. And on the cost front, the London Olympics may cause airspace 
congestion, compounding the continuing fuel pressures. That said, with about half its summer seats sold, the 
company says revenue per seat will be up by the "low to mid-single-digits". EasyJet also continues to woo cost-
conscious business travellers (now a fifth of its customer base). Frequencies have been stepped up on routes such 
as Paris-Milan and London-Amsterdam, while new regional bases at Nice and Toulouse look like a timely bid for Air 
France trade given impending restructuring at the French carrier.
So the question for investors is whether easyJet can keep up the pace. Its shares, at a two-year high, have had a 
strong run, so profit-taking could occur. But easyJet trades on 11 times estimated earnings for 2012 and under 10 
times for 2013, compared with 13.5 (2012 consensus) for low-cost rival Ryanair. The altitude is not demanding.

Ryanair today said that the Government has missed an opportunity to sell Shannon Airport to a private sector buyer 
who would invest in infrastructure and growth.
The comment came after the Government said earlier today that it has decided to split Shannon out from the Dublin 
Airport Authority (DAA) and merge it with Shannon Development to form a new State owned entity with a 
commercial mandate.
Ryanair said Shannon's traffic has fallen from over 3.6 million in 2007 to 1.6 million in 2012 and Ryanair does not 
believe that a semi-state company will make Shannon either cost competitive or efficient.
"When the BAA sold Edinburgh Airport (9m ppa) last month for almost E1 billion and when the trend across Europe 
is for Govts to sell airports to private sector investors, who can run and grow them more efficiently, today's transfer 
of Shannon from one semi-state quango to another is a missed opportunity to introduce real change and reform as 
well as real competition between the Govt-owned airports," Ryanair said. However, the Government's decision has 
been welcomed in the region. The Irish Hotels Federation (IHF) today voiced strong support for the Government's

Ryanair today said that the Government has missed an opportunity to sell Shannon Airport to a private sector buyer 
who would invest in infrastructure and growth.
The comment came after the Government said earlier today that it has decided to split Shannon out from the Dublin 
Airport Authority (DAA) and merge it with Shannon Development to form a new State owned entity with a 
commercial mandate.
Ryanair said Shannon's traffic has fallen from over 3.6 million in 2007 to 1.6 million in 2012 and Ryanair does not 
believe that a semi-state company will make Shannon either cost competitive or efficient.
"When the BAA sold Edinburgh Airport (9m ppa) last month for almost E1 billion and when the trend across Europe 
is for Govts to sell airports to private sector investors, who can run and grow them more efficiently, today's transfer 
of Shannon from one semi-state quango to another is a missed opportunity to introduce real change and reform as 
well as real competition between the Govt-owned airports," Ryanair said. However, the Government's decision has 
been welcomed in the region. The Irish Hotels Federation (IHF) today voiced strong support for the Government's 
plans to establish Shannon Airport as an independent entity and to restructure enterprise support agencies in the 
Shannon region. Micheal Vaughan, the Shannon based President of the IHF said this is a momentous

Highlight: Interview
Aditya Ghosh
President, IndiGo
India's top no-frills airline profits from a simple formula, writes James Fontanella-Khan 
Body
Aditya Ghosh, youthful president of IndiGo, says there is no big secret behind the success of India's only profitable 
airline in an infamously difficult aviation market.
When asked how the no-frills carrier manages to make money while its rivals bleed red ink thanks to extortionate 
taxes , high fuel prices and fierce price competition, Mr Ghosh simply says: "We stick to the basics."
"We don't try to do anything fancy, we don't try to bend the wind, we just stick to our business model," the 36-year-
old executive says from his cramped office at company headquarters in the New Delhi suburb of Gurgaon. "We fly 
our planes on time; the flying experience is neat; and our fares are consistently lower than our competitors."
Analysts tend to agree. They say that, in contrast to Kingfisher Airlines, the debt-laden carrier close to bankruptcy , 
privately held IndiGo has followed the strategy of Southwest Airlines in the US and Europe's Ryanair: offer only low-
cost fares to busy destinations using just one type of plane.
"In terms of operations IndiGo is by far the best airline in India," says Sharan Lillaney, aviation analyst at Angel 
Broking. "It's definitely on track to become the Indian Southwest, but it will have to prove itself over time."
The president of the five-year-old carrier, owned by Rahul Bhatia, an Indian billionaire, and Rakesh Gangwal, the 
US Airways former chief executive, says keeping things simple in a crowded field of seven airlines including the 
subsidised national carrier is not easy.
'It is surprising how many airlines stray from the basics'
"'Sticking to the basics' sounds obvious but it is surprising how many airlines stray from these basics," says Mr 
Ghosh.
Analysts say the quality of IndiGo's in-flight services and the chic PanAm-style of its cabin crew uniforms have 
given the young carrier an edge over rivals by bolstering its perception as a premium brand despite being a low-
cost operator.
This has helped IndiGo win over many business travellers who have tended to prefer Jet Airways, the country's 
largest full-service operator, and Air India, the state-run flag-carrier, reckons Mr Ghosh.
Figures from India's directorate general of civil aviation show that IndiGo's on-time performance is the best in the 
country, with 96 per cent of its New Delhi and Mumbai flights landing on schedule.
Jet Airways trails with 84 per cent of its flights on the same routes - the country's busiest - landing on time while 
Kingfisher gets just 59 per cent of it flights on schedule.
That performance has helped turn IndiGo, which has been profitable in each of the past four years, into the 
country's largest carrier by market share despite having a smaller fleet than its competitors. Net profit rose to 
Rs6.5bn ($105m) in the year ended March 2011, compared with Rs5.5bn a year earlier.
With 56 aircraft serving 26 destinations across India it controls 21.9 per cent of the passenger market, the same as 
Jet Airways which has close to 100 planes over about 60 routes.
"We want to expand," says Mr Ghosh, "but we are going to do it slowly," sticking to the no-frills model.
IndiGo last year ordered 180 Airbus A320 jets worth $15.6bn - the second largest single order in the commercial 
aviation industry. Mr Ghosh says that, while some of these planes will be used to fly to the Gulf and parts of south 
and south-east Asia, the majority will sustain the carrier's domestic growth ambitions.
"This is one of the most under-penetrated markets in the world," says Mr Ghosh. "There are 3m Indians for every 
plane we have in this country, compared to one in 50,000 people in developed markets . . .   there is no 
overcapacity problem here."
India's passenger numbers soared nearly 20 per cent in 2011 to almost 60m compared with the previous year and 
analysts expect that figure to grow at about 15 per cent annually.
But Mr Ghosh says there is no space for complacency. With global markets in turmoil, plans for an initial public 
offering have been shelved as IndiGo focuses on sustaining profits in an environment in which Mr Ghosh expects at 
least one airline to go bankrupt within the next year.
"If market forces prevail, then definitely there will be somebody really struggling that could go down," he says.
"I must add," he says quickly, "that this is not meant to be a self-serving statement. If tomorrow IndiGo is not 
running an efficient airline we do not deserve to be allowed either to survive."

New challenges on radar for Ireland 's two airline giants

Ireland may be one of Europe's economic patients, but there are few countries where the aviation sector is quite so 
interesting. The two big Irish carriers, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, are both, in very different ways, at intriguing 
watersheds.
Ryanair has long outshone its peers, but last week Aer Lingus was also top of the class. While Lufthansa, SAS and 
Air France all reported widening quarter losses, Aer Lingus cut its losses, and most analysts agreed the results 
showed that chief executive Christoph Mueller is making progress, despite high oil prices and tough economic 
conditions.
The results only added to the fizz of speculation that surrounded Aer Lingus, after it was revealed that Middle 
Eastern giant Etihad had acquired a near 3 per cent stake in the airline. Nothing is at all certain yet -- an extremely 
difficult pension problem remains to be solved, for example -- but most analysts believe it may only be a matter of 
time before the Abu Dhabi airline buys the government's 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
**The state of Aer Lingus**
So what would a former Irish flag carrier that was one-third owned by a cash-rich Middle Eastern airline look like? 
Looking at what Etihad has done at Air Berlin, where it recently amassed a 29.2 per cent share after first buying just 
under 3 per cent, gives some good clues.
That purchase has given Etihad a good foothold in the German market and it is likely any move to buy a stake in 
Aer Lingus would be motivated by the Irish airline's strong presence in Britain as well as Ireland, not least at London 
Heathrow.
Building up strong codeshare partnerships backed by shareholdings has become the latest tactic in Etihad's bid to 
catch up on its Middle Eastern rivals, Emirates and Qatar Airways, in terms of European penetration. Recent figures 
from aviation analyst group CAPA, showing seats sold between Britain and the Middle East, puts Emirates well in 
New challenges on radar for Ireland 's two airline giants
the lead, followed by British Airways, and then Qatar Airways, trailed closely by Etihad. A strong partnership with 
Aer Lingus could help to change that.
At Air Berlin, Etihad has placed its chief executive and chief financial officer on the board. A similar approach could 
be expected at Aer Lingus, allowing Etihad boss James Hogan to exert a direct influence on Aer Lingus strategy. 
While he points out that such an investment would not give Etihad control of Aer Lingus, Merrion Capital analyst 
Gerard Moore believes Etihad would look to benefit from this influence in a number of ways.
"It would look to feed as much traffic from Ireland and Britain into its Abu Dhabi hub as it could. It would look to win 
as much of the Australia and Asia Pacific- bound transfer traffic market as possible," he said. "Aer Lingus could 
benefit from this through codeshare agreements that would give it a share of profit for every passenger it puts on an 
Etihad flight."  
Aer Lingus could also look to route Etihad transatlantic bound passengers through Dublin, said Moore. For 
example, Etihad is currently restricted on the number of flights it operates to Canada because of competition 
concerns Canadian carriers have with Middle Eastern carriers. Etihad could use Aer Lingus to gain greater access 
to North American airports, Moore believes.
Dublin has distinct advantages in this regard. Not only is it a relatively short flight from the US east coast, but it is 
one of just a handful of airports outside the US through which passengers can pre-clear US immigration and 
customs.
Of course, if Etihad buys a bigger stake in Aer Lingus, it is likely to do so because it views it as a good standalone 
investment in its own right, the strategic advantages notwithstanding. Gerard Moore points out that Etihad is an 
airline with deep pockets and so the type of investment needed to take a chunk of Aer Lingus is not a big deal.
"The EUR 15 million needed to purchase nearly 3 per cent of Aer Lingus thus far is about half the price of a new 
aeroplane for Etihad,"   Moore said. "Nevertheless, Aer Lingus is a very well-run airline that is making money and 
will probably pay dividends soon, so Etihad management could certainly justify this investment on a standalone 
basis. On top of that, they may also believe that they still have a lot to learn from Aer Lingus in terms of training, 
operations, route planning and other areas. Etihad has only been in existence since 2003."  
There is much to gain for Aer Lingus too if Etihad buys a significant shareholding. Apart from the immediate benefits 
of added traffic from a codeshare agreement, Etihad would be viewed as a long-term, strong investor with deep 
pockets that is committed to the industry.
"Etihad's investment in Air Berlin and the $255 million loan it provided to it removed all doubts about its financial 
security,"  said Moore. "Aer Lingus has plenty of cash and is not in a situation where it needs this type of help but, if 
that changed in the future, Etihad would certainly have the deep pockets to help it."  
However, all of this threatens to ignore the presence of the other great pillar of Irish aviation right at the heart of the 
story. Ryanair is not just a fierce competitor of Aer Lingus, but also a 29.8 per cent shareholder in the airline. It has 
said that it is open to selling its shareholding in tandem with the government, but the complications of EU foreign 
ownership rules and Ryanair's tendency to do things its own way, mean that high stakes games could lie ahead.
Etihad has almost 3 per cent of Aer Lingus, so buying the government's stake would give it 28 per cent, still less 
than Ryanair. Ryanair was blocked by Aer Lingus from getting a seat on the board because Aer Lingus argued it 
was a competitor. It is likely Ryanair would kick up a fuss if Aer Lingus took a different attitude with Etihad, and that 
airline in turn would probably question the value of an investment without board influence.
But in reality, Ryanair has already written off the cost of its Aer Lingus investment and such boardroom 
machinations may be a sideshow for Michael O'Leary and his management team as they try to guide the low-cost 
pioneer through a whole new stage of its own existence.
**Ryanair looks East**
New challenges on radar for Ireland 's two airline giants
Ryanair's ambitions are on a different scale to those of Aer Lingus. Its network has crept ever further eastward and 
is now pushed right up against the Eastern European Union border.
The corpse of Hungarian airline Malev was barely cold when Ryanair announced it would open a base in Budapest. 
Other eastern bases have been opened or announced in Poland and Cyprus and there has even been some 
speculation in the past that Ryanair could look to acquire its Eastern European rival Wizz Air to quickly build mass 
in the region.
Most intriguingly, there was speculation in recent weeks that the airline was eyeing up routes into Israel and Turkey. 
Healthy economic growth, rising salaries, a booming aviation market in Turkey, warm winters and the right airport 
deals could conceivably tempt Ryanair into virgin territory. Yet all of this must be viewed in the knowledge that the 
conveyer belt of new Boeing 737s that has sustained and driven Ryanair growth is coming to an end.
"They are under no pressure to order new aircraft,"  said Brian Devine of NCB Stockbrokers. "Their aircraft will be 
less than four years old when all of their orders are delivered. If you look at Southwest it is about 11 or 12 years old. 
Significant costs come in when they are about eight years old because you have to do a maintenance rehaul. But 
they can allow it to run for a while and wait for the best deal. They are trying to play Chinese aircraft manufacturer 
COMAC off against Boeing to see if Boeing will shift on their prices. It will be 2016 at the earliest before they 
actually take an order."  
The nature of how Ryanair does its business is changing as growth slows and aircraft deliveries come to an end.
"There is certainly more of a focus on pushing up pricing than there has been in the past in Ryanair," said aviation 
analyst Neil Glynn of Credit Suisse in London. "Fare sales generally start around EUR 15.99 rather than the pricing 
that you would have seen through 2008 or 2009 with EUR 1 flights. It is a function of the business maturing but also 
of the European market maturing. But it certainly does not spell the end of the low-cost model for Ryanair. The key 
for Ryanair is how its fares compare to other airlines and other modes of transport and how low do its fares need to 
be to stimulate demand."  
The airline still retains the ruthlessness of old when anything gets in the way of it offering the low fares it needs to 
undercut the competition. But its decision to rip half of its routes out of Alicante when the Spanish airport asked it to 
use airbridges displays an increased focus on what is, or is not, working, some analysts believe.
Analysis recently published by aviation network planning publication Anno Aero illustrates the point. While the 
airline did establish 269 routes in the period between August 2011 and August 2012, it also dropped 130 routes in 
the same period. A net gain of 139 routes is still impressive while other airlines are cutting back, but route planning 
at Ryanair is now less an unstoppable juggernaut and more a game of chess.
The end of its fleet expansion later this year will only add to the pressure to drop less-performing routes in order to 
capitalise on new opportunities. Ryanair grounded 80 aircraft last winter, and analysts say they are unlikely to be 
deployed next winter without a significant drop in the price of fuel.
"Ryanair was a classic growth company,"   said Gerard Moore. "But now they have changed approach and make 
more decisions based on the overall portfolio, trading different routes off against one another. The positives of doing 
this are that it keeps on raising the bar for the profitability for each route. This allows them to look, for example, at 
the least performing ten routes and churn them into new more profitable routes in order to raise the overall 
average."  
The negative side of this is that at the overall European level they will be missing out on market share gains, Moore 
believes.
"They will miss out on growth opportunities that they could otherwise go for because they have decided to cap their 
own growth. Other airlines such as Easyjet and Norwegian are still growing.
New challenges on radar for Ireland 's two airline giants
"We estimate that if Ryanair failed to do an aircraft deal which ensured deliveries before 2020, and if it shunned the 
leasing market, its market share would fall from 11 per cent today to 9 per cent in 2020. Over the same period, 
Easyjet's market share would grow from 8 per cent to 10 per cent, assuming it followed the upper end of its fleet 
plan. Easyjet would thus surpass Ryanair as Europe's number one low-cost carrier," Morre said.
"Norwegian Air is also expected to become a clear number three low-cost carrier player by 2020, with the company 
itself estimating it will hold 6 per cent market share by 2020."  
Nevertheless, consolidation rather than massive growth and settling into new realities may be the priority for 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus as they fly their sometimes crossing paths in the coming years. Just how both airlines 
handle likely turbulence ahead will set the tone of Irish aviation for a long time to come.
.........................
**Bulletin**
*Aer Lingus and Ryanair both face changing times and new challenges. Aer Lingus looks set to finally emerge from 
beneath the Government's wing, while Ryanair must learn to live without phenomenal growth.
*Quarterly results for Aer Lingus last week showed that it is performing well and Etihad's purchase of just under 3 
per cent of its shares shows it is firmly in the Middle Eastern airline's sights.
*Ryanair may have established 269 routes since last August, but it also dropped 130. A long-held growth strategy is 
slowing into one of consolidation.

Terminology, as professionals might have it -- or jargon, as detractors might suggest -- plays a role in virtually every 
area of professional endeavour.
It is often suggested that professionals use jargon to retain the mystique of the profession and, in effect, to exclude 
outsiders. This can sometimes be the case. It might even be conceded that lawyers are among the worst offenders.
It seems to me that there is a case for trying to use terminology that at least has some prospect of being understood 
by a wider public. This is particularly so in the context of Latin terminology. Why, for example, use *locus standi 
*when 'standing' will do equally well?
But not all terms are capable of quite such an easy translation. Two examples are 'discretion' and 'deference'. 
Discretion conveys an impression of a judge being entitled to do almost what the judge likes. Lawyers will know that 
discretion, as used in the context of a judge's role, is a narrower, much more principle-based concept. However, 
there can be little doubt that the term may be apt to mislead.
But at the heart of the debate about the standard of judicial review is the concept of 'deference'. In broad terms, the 
courts are said to give 'deference' to the decisions of administrators and statutory bodies. The problem is that the 
term conveys to the intelligent, non-legally trained reader an impression of almost doffing the cap.
Many public bodies now make decisions which affect the rights and entitlements of individuals, including social 
welfare tribunals and planning authorities.
Ryanair (and, very often, it is Ryanair) may be unhappy with the decision of the Aviation Regulator or airport 
authorities. The fundamental question is as to what role the courts have in reviewing or scrutinising those decisions.
There are two justifications for the courts giving an appropriate level of respect to the decisions of public bodies. 
The first is the question of expertise.
With all due deference and respect
Those aspects of the decisions of expert bodies which involve the body using its particular expertise may attract a 
higher level of respect.
Secondly, there are cases involving public bodies which do not involve the courts giving any special level of respect 
to the decision because the decision is of a type where the law gives no particular weight to the views of the public 
body concerned. For example, the law gives the courts, rather than the planning authority, the task of deciding 
whether there has been a breach of planning law.
The law does not give a planning authority any particular role in interpreting its own planning permissions.
One of the difficulties in recent years is the proliferation of statutes which give a right of appeal -- or a right of appeal 
on a point of law -- from the decisions of statutory bodies. The courts are increasingly faced with the task of 
deciding, without much statutory guidance, the appropriate level of review.
Development of a single and coherent statutory scheme for the conduct of such appeals to the courts would add 
greatly to the ease and coherence of such an appellate structure.
The Constitution gives the Oireachtas the power to make laws. The courts have the right to scrutinise those laws to 
determine whether they are consistent with the Constitution and, of course, to interpret the law. However, many of 
the laws which are passed in modern times involve the Oireachtas in giving a particular decision-making role to 
individuals (for example government ministers) or to statutory bodies (for example, An Bord Pleanála or the 
Employment Appeals Tribunal).
If the law conferring that decision-making power is inconsistent with the Constitution, then the courts should strike it 
down. If, however, the law is consistent with the Constitution, the separation of powers requires the courts to 
respect the fact that the Oireachtas has given the relevant power to a particular person or body, and not the courts.
Similar respect is paid by the courts to private bodies which have the right to make decisions.
Where parties agree that a dispute is to go to arbitration, the courts will only intervene in the result in very limited 
circumstances. Likewise, membership of private organisations, such as major sporting organisations, involves an 
agreement between all concerned to abide by the rules of the organisation.
Of course, if the relevant body does not comply with its own rules, or if there is a fundamental failure to provide 
constitutionally-guaranteed fairness in the process, the courts can intervene.
There is no opt-out clause. If you don't like the rules of the GAA, you can always resign, although you may find it 
hard to operate as a hurler outside the confines of the GAA.
Where the law gives the power to make a final decision to some entity other than the courts, then the courts' 
respect for that decision is not really deferring to the body concerned, but rather respecting the law.

Aer Lingus, the Irish flag-carrier, will issue its first dividend since flotation six years ago and said it would aim to 
continue payouts to shareholders every year it makes an operating profit.
The change to dividend policy follows a strong first quarter, when growth in long-haul routes prompted an upgrade 
in full-year forecasts .
The planned payout of 3 cents a share - totalling EUR15.9m - follows pressure from the company's biggest 
shareholder, Ryanair, for access to the more than EUR400m net cash Aer Lingus holds on its balance sheet. But 
the low-cost carrier hit out yesterday at the "paltry" sum being offered.
The dividend, planned for July, will bolster Irish government coffers by about EUR4m, since Dublin owns 25 per 
cent of the airline.
The government is seeking to sell that holding but has been delayed by a debate over how to cover a EUR700m 
hole in the pension fund for Aer Lingus and Dublin airport employees.
It has said that it wants at least EUR1 per share, a threshold analysts believe should be easy to achieve. Shares fell 
slightly in trading on Friday, to 98 cents.
Aer Lingus asked shareholders last autumn to approve technical changes that would allow special dividends to be 
paid. But it said yesterday that rather than special dividends, it was committed to annual payouts in years of 
operating profit, so long as the payments were "appropriate and prudent in the context of the group's financial 
position, strategic objectives and prospects". It said it would aim to repeat this 3 cent per share payout for another 
two years.
Joe Gill, an analyst with Bloxham, said that the conservative size of the dividend - against operating profits of 
EUR49m last year - could boost the value of the government's stake when it decided to sell.
Maiden dividend payout by Aer Lingus
He expects the holding to come on to the block this year, since "the troika" - the European Commission, 
International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank - overseeing Ireland's EUR68bn bailout recognise that 
it will be easier to sell than other government assets.
Middle Eastern carrier Etihad has emerged as a strong contender to buy the holding after revealing a 3 per cent 
stake in the group this week and saying the two airlines were in talks over a code-sharing agreement, which would 
allow them to sell seats on each other's flights.
Mr Gill said such a deal would appeal to the government, which was likely to require any buyer to commit to 
retaining routes into Ireland.

Ryanair Condemns Aer Lingus Dividend As Paltry, Insult To Irish Govt
Ryanair Condemns Aer Lingus Dividend As Paltry, Insult To Irish Govt

Body
(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) welcomed Aer Lingus's (AERL.L) decision to pay shareholders 
a dividend, which highlighted the Irish Govt's continuing control over the Board and policies of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair's call for a dividend over the past three years were repeatedly ignored and Ryanair was prevented from 
tabling a request for a dividend at last year's AGM, yet within weeks of Minister Leo Varadkar calling for a dividend, 
the Board of Aer Lingus has done as he requested and declared one.
However, Ryanair condemned the proposed 3 cents per share dividend as paltry and an insult to Minister Varadkar 
from a company with a gross cash pile of over 1 billion euros and net cash balances of over 400 million euros. The 
Irish Govt will receive a dividend of less that 4 million euros from Aer Lingus which will make no difference 
whatsoever to Govt finances.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said,
"Aer Lingus could easily afford a dividend of ?50m which would generate ?12.5m for Minister Varadkar while still 
leaving Aer Lingus with almost ?1bn of gross cash, which the airline doesn't need since it has no aircraft orders, no 
material capital expenditures and no expansion plans. Today's dividend of 3c per share is an insult to Minister 
Varadkar and the Irish Govt."

Ryanair carried 6pc more passengers last month than in April of last year, the airline's latest traffic figures show.
The no-frills Irish airline carried 7.2 million people on its aircraft during the month compared to the 6.8 million it 
carried in April 2011.
The figures also show that 76.3 million people flew with the airline in the 12 months to the end of April.
Its load factor- an industry wide measure of how well airlines fill their aircraft - fell 1pc to 81pc in April and it 
recorded a load factor of 82pc for the 12 month period to the end of last month. The rise in passenger numbers 
comes despite Ryanair having reduced capacity across much of its network of routes around Europe to cope with 
surging fuel costs.

Body
An Irish subsidiary of US software giant Oracle recorded a 79pc increase in pre-tax profits to dollar 55m (E41m) last 
year, new accounts just filed with the Companies Office show.
Dublin-based Oracle East Central Europe Ltd increased its turnover by 26pc to dollar 214m to the end of May last 
year.
The filings show that the company, which produces and sells computer software for the Central European market, 
paid a dividend of dollar 140m to its US parent last year.
The directors state in their report that they were "satisfied with the performance of the company during 2011".
The main activity of the firm -- based at East Point Business Park in Dublin -- is to sell computer software and 
hardware products and related services in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Albania, 
Macedonia, Malta and the Baltic states. The numbers employed by the firm remained at 64 last year made up of 57 
in sales staff and seven employed in administration. The firm's operating profits last year increased by 82pc from 
dollar 30.6m to dollar 55.8m. After the profits and dividend payout are taken into account, the firm's accumulated 
profits fell from dollar 178.9m to dollar 87.1m. Cash held by the firm last year reduced from dollar 201.3m to dollar 
128m. The company's cost of sales last year totalled dollar 79.3m compared to dollar 63.9m in 2010 with the firm's 
administrative expenses increasing from dollar 75.2m in 2010 to dollar 79.2m last year. The figures show that the 
Baltic States accounted for dollar 24.3m in revenues with dollar 11.7m generated in Bulgaria and dollar 5.3m 
recorded in Macedonia or Malta. Oracle was founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison, who remains the corporation's chief 
executive. Globally, last year, Oracle increased its revenues by 32pc to dollar 35.6bn. The Irish Independent XXXX 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said yesterday that Aer Lingus will be "broken up" if Etihad or a financial investor 
buys the Government's 25.1pc stake in the former state-owned airline. But the Ryanair chief executive also said 
that the low-cost carrier "would welcome" any other financially strong airline or investor that acquires the 
Roundup-Oracle Ireland profits increase Roundup
Government's stake. He said Ryanair, which owns just under 30pc of Aer Lingus, could work with the buyer "to 
restore shareholder value" at its rival. Mr O'Leary was responding to Etihad's confirmation that it has bought a 2.9pc 
stake in Aer Lingus in recent weeks. Etihad declined to comment. However, analysts said there's no reason to 
believe that Aer Lingus would suffer any detrimental structural shift if the Middle East airline were to buy the 
Government's stake. Transport Minister Leo Varadkar yesterday described Etihad's purchase of Aer Lingus shares 
as a "good thing". "It is a vote of confidence both in the airline and the Irish economy," he said. Shares in Aer 
Lingus closed up 1.8pc yesterday at 99.3 cent, while shares in Ryanair were 2.2pc higher at E4.35. Ryanair has 
previously indicated that it would be willing to sell its holding in Aer Lingus to any buyer of the Government's stake 
subject to an "acceptable agreement on price and maximising shareholder value". Ryanair has made two failed bids 
for Aer Lingus. A spokesman for Ryanair declined to say whether the airline would be willing to offload a portion of 
its stake to any potential buyer, or whether it would enter into a sale discussion on an all-or-nothing basis. As a non-
European carrier, Etihad is prohibited from owning more than 49pc of an EU airline. It already owns just under 30pc 
of Air Berlin. British Airways owner IAG had been touted as another potential buyer of the Aer Lingus stake, but 
after recently completing the purchase of BMI and having expressed an interest in Portugal's TAP, the chances of 
any move on the Irish carrier are waning. The chief executive of Qatar Airlines, which had been perceived as 
another potentially interested party, recently ruled out having any designs on Aer Lingus, saying he would "leave 
that opportunity to Etihad". The Irish Independent XXXX Pre-tax profits at directory enquiry firm, 11890, last year 
increased more than four fold to E688,177, new figures show. According to accounts filed by the Dublin-based Call 
11890 Ltd, they show that the firm increased its pre-tax profits by 308pc from E168,318 to E688,177 in the 12 
months to May 31,2011. The abridged accounts show that the firm's gross profit increased by 54pc from E1m to 
E1.67m last year. Founder and chief executive of the firm, Nicola Byrne said yesterday that she is "very pleased" 
with how the company performed last year. Ms Byrne confirmed that revenues remained static last year and said: 
"We were more profitable last year because we became better at what we do and we have invested a lot in 
technology." The firm is the only exclusively-Irish based and owned directory enquiry firm with offices based in 
Dublin and Galway where numbers employed dropped from 79 to 61. Rival directory enquiry firm, 11850 has its 
main call centre for Ireland located in the Philippines after shutting down its Dublin call centre in 2010. Ms Byrne 
said: "The 'Buy Irish' message from us started to resonate with people here last year and it gained traction." Ms 
Byrne said that the firm's recent promotion of free calls from Eircom landlines for three months increased its market 
share to around 23pc. "We have taken a hit with that, but our profits will be in or our around what we had last year 
as we were ahead of where we were last year in terms of profits before the promotion. The Irish Examiner XXXX 
The Government has never submitted any documentation to the ECB on the renegotiation of the promissory notes, 
according to a member of the bank. The director general of the Secretariat and Languages Services in the ECB, 
Pierre van der Haegen, said: "Having duly looked into this matter, we would like to inform you that the ECB did not 
receive any documents from the Irish Government on the renegotiation of the terms of the promissory notes." The 
Irish Examiner requested copies of any requests by the Government and any negotiating documents submitted to 
the ECB under the right of access to documents enshrined in EU treaties. Micheal Noonan, the finance minister, 
deferred the promissory notes payment of E3.06bn on Mar 29 and replaced it with a long-term government bond 
backed by the Bank of Ireland. Mr Noonan said Bank of Ireland may refinance the bond through the ECB. "Put 
simply, E3.06bn will be settled by delivery to IBRC (the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation) of a long-term 
Government bond with an equivalent fair value," Mr Noonan told the Dail. "Ultimately, it is intended that this long-
term Government bond will be financed for one year, on commercial terms, with Bank of Ireland, who may, in turn, 
re-finance the bond with the ECB." A spokesperson for the ECB said there was "no formal obligation on the Irish 
Government to (submit documents to the ECB) do this." The press office of the ECB pointed to a recent speech by 
its president, Mario Draghi, who said it was an Irish operation but that Ireland was expected to meet all of its 
obligations. He said: "The ECB is not part of it, as it is the redemption of the promissory notes and a subsequent 
reduction in emergency liquidity assistance provided by the Central Bank of Ireland. "Again it is of the utmost 
importance that the commitments of the Irish State are met in line with standing contracts and agreements." The 
Department of Finance said that a working group had been set up to work on the promissory notes. The Irish

OFT renews probe into Ryanair's Aer Lingus stake

Body
UK Court has permitted the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to investigate Ryanair's 30% shareholding in Aer Lingus. 
The probe aims to find whether the stake would harm UK consumers as both airlines are big players in the United 
Kingdom.
The OFT investigation started in September 2010, but was blocked in July this year under Ryanair's objection that it 
was "out of time". Ryanair acquired its stake in 2006 as part of an unsuccessful takeover bid. The European 
Commission blocked the bid in 2007 because of its potential effect on UK customers and aviation competition.
"It is unacceptable that our principal competitor has been allowed to remain as a significant shareholder on our 
share register even though the European Commission blocked their hostile takeover almost five years ago", 
comments Christoph Mueller, chief executive, Aer Lingus.
"This intolerable situation cannot be allowed to continue and today's judgment confirms that the OFT has the 
jurisdiction to investigate the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus," he adds.
The renewal of the investigation means the OFT could refer Ryanair's stake to the Competition Commission, which 
can order divestment. ypalagacheva@euromoneyplc.com

UK Court has permitted the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to investigate Ryanairâ(EURO)(TM)s 30% shareholding in 
Aer Lingus. The probe aims to find whether the stake would harm UK consumers as both airlines are big players in 
the United Kingdom.
The OFT investigation started in September 2010, but was blocked in July this year under Ryanairâ(EURO)(TM)s 
objection that it was â(EURO)oeout of timeâ(EURO). Ryanair acquired its stake in 2006 as part of an unsuccessful 
takeover bid. The European Commission blocked the bid in 2007 because of its potential effect on UK customers 
and aviation competition.
"It is unacceptable that our principal competitor has been allowed to remain as a significant shareholder on our 
share register even though the European Commission blocked their hostile takeover almost five years 
agoâ(EURO), comments Christoph Mueller, chief executive, Aer Lingus.
"This intolerable situation cannot be allowed to continue and today's judgment confirms that the OFT has the 
jurisdiction to investigate the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus,â(EURO) he 
adds.
The renewal of the investigation means the OFT could refer Ryanair's stake to the Competition Commission, which 
can order divestment. ypalagacheva@euromoneyplc.com

UK blames 'severe weather' for long queues at Heathrow airport

The UK government has blamed the country's notorious weather for long immigration queues at airports last 
weekend, which have stoked fears about preparations for this summer's Olympic Games.
Damian Green, the immigration minister, told parliament yesterday there had been "some breaches of acceptable 
waiting times" at Heathrow airport, but blamed it on "severe weather".
Dismissing what he called "wild suggestions" from the opposition Labour party about lengthy waiting times, Mr 
Green acknowledged that queues had been too long and promised that all immigration desks at Heathrow and 
other key border points would be staffed during peak periods for the games.
Complaints of chaos at UK airports have been growing since late last year, following cuts in the number of border 
officials and a Home Office decision to subject every arriving passenger to rigorous security checks. This was the 
result of a scandal last summer when some border officials were found to have relaxed controls without permission.
Boris Johnson, London's mayor, said yesterday that the delays had given visitors "a terrible impression of the UK" 
and urged ministers in his own Conservative party to take control of the situation. "2 hr immigration line. 2 people at 
desks. Welcome to the UK. What a disgrace," one disgruntled visitor tweeted. Another added: "Great Britain should 
be called Great Obstacles."
Most airlines and BAA, Heathrow's operator, declined to comment on the controversy. But one person close to BAA 
questioned the suggestion that a stormy weekend was responsible for the airport tempest: "[The government] would 
be better off focusing on providing enough staff for the [passport] checks they have put in place."
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said the lengthy immigration queues were not confined to Heathrow 
and highlighted similar issues at Stansted airport, from where the Irish airline operates. "The big problem with the 
queues at Heathrow and at Stansted is they [the Home Office] are treating EU citizens like potential bloody 
terrorists and they are not."

Mr O'Leary accused the UK Border Force of "mismanagement", claiming it was not short-staffed as a result of 
budget cuts but rather suffering from a work-to-rule mentality.

Push for Heathrow airlines to fund extra border staff Cameron backs bid to end airport chaos

Airlines using London's Heathrow airport would pay higher landing fees to help sort out Britain's border chaos under 
a plan backed by David Cameron, prime minister.
Heathrow owner BAA is studying the plan, which foresees airlines funding extra Border Force staff through the 
charges they pay the airport operator.
The proposal emerged as the British government was trying to contain a growing row over long queues at 
Heathrow's passport control ahead of the Olympic Games . Ministers hope to fix the problem of two-hour-plus 
queues by ensuring Border Force staff respond rapidly to big influxes of passengers inside Heathrow's immigration 
halls.
Mr Cameron believes that airlines should meet a share of the cost of cutting the queues. One government official 
said: "People standing in the lines often think it's the airlines' fault - not the government's."
Another official said: "The real answer is to get the airlines to pay for more security - that's the long-term answer."
BAA levies annual landing charges worth more than $1.6bn at Heathrow. The fees pay for infrastructure 
investment, which includes some equipment at the border, but the company is interested in the possibility of using 
the charges to also fund additional Border Force staff.
The Border Force's headcount is due to be cut by 18 per cent by 2015 compared with 2010 levels, and the 
reductions are contributing to the long queues at passport control at Heathrow. Damian Green, UK immigration 
minister, tried to reassure travellers yesterday, telling parliament that queues at passport control at Heathrow were 
partly owing to "severe weather". He promised all immigration desks at Heathrow and other airports would be 
staffed during peak periods for the Olympics.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said the queues were not confined to Heathrow and highlighted similar

treating EU citizens like potential bloody terrorists and they are not."

no final decisions having been reached. The person added the arrangements could involve airlines getting a rebate 
on their landing charges if the Border Force missed performance targets on queues.
Theresa May, home secretary, is expected to meet airlines this week. A Home Office official said there was no 
opposition in principle to the idea of the private sector funding public sector border guards, just as shopping centres 
sometimes pay for local police to patrol malls. "We will look at the proposal with interest," said the official.

Airline meals - 85 years old
Crack open the diminutive plastic bottle of lukewarm Chardonnay and lift the lid on your foil-packed chicken 
something or other! Tuesday, 1 May marks the 85th anniversary of airline catering.
British Airways claims its predecessor Imperial Airways invented in-flight catering on its London to Paris service in 
1927.
A male steward in spotless white tunic offered his 20 passengers the choice of whisky, beer or sparkling water, 
together with sandwiches or biscuits. A thermos flask meant coffee or beef tea was also available.
What a contrast to today, when passengers on "full service" short-haul flights can choose fromwell, pretty much a 
knocked-down version of the same menu.
Further food for thought...
EADS's UK salesmen are mischievously pitching a naval version of the Typhoon to the MoD as an alternative to the 
delayed carrier variant of the JSF.
Or what, we are assured, one very senior executive at the European aerospace giant's Paris lair insists on calling 
the "marinated Eurofighter".
Wait a minute, though: isn't the art of marinating all about patiently preparing your dish for a long time, in the hope 
the end result will be all the better?
It seems a perfect description of EADS's sales tactics.

Green and bear it
Plain-speaking Michael O'Leary and Ryanair would never want to be known for descending into jargon, but we think 
this spin from the low-cost carrier about its free magazine qualifies as Yuckspeak.
"Ryanair goes even greener as size of in-flight mag cut by 50%" = "We're spending even less money on you, loser!"
Mystery of the missing Spitfires
Twenty missing Spitfires from the Second World War could be found and restored. The fighters were buried still 
unassembled in their crates by the RAF in the Burmese jungle in 1945 as a precaution against them being 
discovered by the enemy.
The problem is, no-one remembered to dig them up again afterwards.
Now improving UK-Burma relations mean a team of specialists from both countries has been using radar to locate 
the burial sites.
Eventually, says a UK government spokesman, the iconic warplanes could be rebuilt, and even flown.

Ryanair downgrades its London listing

Ryanair is to change its listing on the London Stock Exchange from a premium listing to a standard listing, while 
maintaining its primary listing on the Irish Stock Exchange.
The move, which was accepted by shareholders at the airline's extraordinary general meeting last week, is good 
news for the Irish Stock Exchange, which has seen a number of big-name defections in recent times.
Last November, Iseq heavyweight CRH announced that it was moving its main share listing to London and retaining 
a secondary listing in Dublin. CRH explained the move by saying the proportion of its shares held by overseas 
investors had grown significantly and that a place in the FTSE index would expose the company to a much wider 
base of investors.
This was followed in January by Greencore's decision to end its ordinary share listing on the Irish Stock Exchange 
in favour of the FTSE. Greencore said it was making the move to increase liquidity.
Ryanair said its decision to drop its premium listing in London from May 21 would not have "any material impact on 
trading or liquidity in any of the three markets on which Ryanair's securities are traded",   it said in a statement.
The airline said that it would retain its listing on the New York Nasdaq exchange, in the form of American depositary 
shares. The EGM also approved a motion to allow for the inclusion of these shares in its ongoing 5 per cent share 
buy-back programme. The airline said that, without such approval, it could not ensure compliance with its airline 
operating licence, which insists that 50 per cent of the airline's ownership must reside in the EU. At present, 
approximately 53.7 per cent of shareholders are EU nationals, which restricts the scale of a buyback, it said.
The airline said that it was making the change from a premium to a standard listing in Britain because the Financial 
Services Authority there had not modified its listing rules to enable Ryanair to use the new repurchase power 
agreed to by shareholders at the egm.

James Osborne
Age: 63
Appearance: smooth, suave, James Bond-like
Newsworthiness: as chairman of Independent News & Media, last Thursday he reprimanded director Paul Connolly, 
who is challenging the exit package of former chief executive Gavin O'Reilly
.....
When Gavin O'Reilly left his role as Independent News and Media (INM) chief executive ten days ago, it looked as 
though chairman James Osborne had done it again.
The corporate lawyer and serial boardroom kingpin has played a key role in the departure of two other chief 
executives in high-profile Irish companies, a record which has singled him out as both ruthless and efficient. With 
the O'Reilly exit announced, it seemed that Osborne had managed to restore harmony to a company which had 
been gripped by shareholder division for six years.
However, a High Court challenge to O'Reilly's EUR 1.87 million payout means that the chairman still has some way 
to go in order to bring peace to the INM board. Director Paul Connolly, a nominee of Denis O'Brien, claims that the 
payment is too large, was made with undue haste and should have been put to the board.
Osborne prides himself on being his own man and, if Connolly thought the courtroom dash -- of which the chairman 
had no advance notice -- would evoke little reaction, he was wrong. At a board meeting last Thursday, Osborne 
gave the businessman a strongly-worded dressing down and asked him to resign from the board.
Board games: James Osborne profiled
Osborne felt the legal challenge was an unnecessary distraction from the real business of INM, and was furious 
about the development. Those who know Osborne believe he will not bear a grudge, but this latest boardroom 
drama from INM will run until the agm in June, at least, when the majority of directors will recommend shareholders 
vote against Connolly's reappointment.
For other shareholders -- who will have hoped that the board was now getting back to business -- the latest row at 
INM must be a bitter disappointment.
Described as smooth and suave, Osborne sees himself as a straight shooter who solves problems and calls it as he 
sees it. The O'Reilly exit deal was put together with a heavy emphasis on legal advice, and under Osborne's watch. 
Those close to the chairman say he does not lean towards any 'camp' in the INM battlefield, but is hellbent on 
getting the heavily indebted media group back on track.
A long-time director of Ryanair, Osborne is well used to turbulence, having been through some very bumpy rides in 
corporate Ireland. Viewed by some as honest and tough, others as clinical and aggressive, in doing what he feels 
must be done in the boardroom, he has managed to exact dramatic change when he believes it is warranted. 
Despite the fact that he has weathered many a corporate storm, Osborne is understood to have been surprised by 
the latest twists and turns at INM, disappointed in some respects, but confident that he can achieve his goals in the 
long run.
Born in Donegal, Osborne was meant to be a solicitor in a local practice after he finished his studies in Trinity 
College. But the family plan, which would have seen the young Protestant lawyer join his grandfather's practice, 
was undone when he refused to sign a non-compete clause proposed by his grandfather's business partner. This 
was an early sign that Osborne would not be swayed by outside opinion.
He joined A&L Goodbody, and enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top. At 45, he left the position of managing partner 
without a 'masterplan' for the future. He just knew he didn't want to be a corporate lawyer for the rest of his life.
During his time with the legal firm, he experienced his first boardroom spat when he became a non-executive 
director of the board of tobacco company PJ Carroll. He had a disagreement with chairman Don Carroll over costly 
and unsuccessful company diversification. In an interview in 1999, Osborne said: "I went to war with him." Carroll 
eventually resigned and was replaced by Laurence Crowley.
Osborne's next boardroom battle was at co-op Golden Vale, where he was a director. He was central to the 
removal of chief executive Jim O'Mahony, proposing the motion to remove him and garnering support among board 
members to this end.
Although these two boardroom dramas sealed Osborne's reputation as a ruthless hard-hitter, one close associate 
said he rejected this image of himself and preferred to think of himself as straightforward and willing to do the right 
thing.
After leaving A&L Goodbody, Osborne got stuck into Ryanair, where he played a key role in the airline's flotation. 
He continues to be a director of the company, and his share options have rewarded him handsomely.
Not all his investments have had such a good turn, however. He was an investor in Fresh Mortgages with former 
Anglo Irish Bank boss Sean FitzPatrick in 2007. Connolly also backed this company, although he had no 
relationship with Osborne. However, it was a short-lived venture which was knocked out by the credit crunch.
On the other hand, a low-profile energy company in which Osborne was involved, Trinergy, sold for an enterprise 
value of EUR 1.9 billion. He was never a big investor in property, and sold out of any holdings well ahead of the 
crash.
Osborne was chosen to be chairman of INM last year with the help of an independent executive recruitment firm. 
He did not know any of the key parties, although he may have met some of them briefly prior to accepting the role. 
Board games: James Osborne profiled
When appointed, O'Brien's two directors -- Connolly and Lucy Gaffney -- voted against Osborne, as there was 
suspicion in the O'Brien camp of every move being made by INM management.
A close friend of Osborne said that he thought long and hard before taking on the INM role, which he felt would be 
complicated and probably fraught with danger. Some friends advised him that he would be "nuts" to take on what 
might be a poisoned chalice.
But what appealed to Osborne was the problem that had to be solved. He would maintain that he went into the 
process open-minded and was perplexed as to why the O'Brien directors voted against his initial appointment.
While he is a believer "that management manage", he gave himself 100 days to assess the situation at INM. A 
close friend said that Osborne listened and watched, probed a little and gradually realised that change was needed. 
His main concerns appear to have been the cost base, given the company's EUR 400 million-plus debt, and the 
digital strategy.
Osborne describes himself as coming from the Michael O'Leary school of business. He often says to people that he 
believes costs should be looked at every day, not every five years. Acquaintances said Osborne was a good 
communicator, with the ability to distil complex issues into very simple terms.
One source described Osborne as "very suave, very sophisticated, almost a James Bond type", very well read and 
urbane. But his time on the Ryanair board would have toughened him up. "You would have to have learned a few 
things sitting on that board," said the source.
One market insider who has seen Osborne in action on several occasions described Osborne as "very, very sharp; 
[he has] a track record of being fairly vicious in terms of what he's prepared to do in order to move things forward, 
as he sees it".
He described him as "fairly clinical, with an ability to be aggressive when he has to be, [he] won't suffer fools gladly 
and [is] incredibly smooth, suave and really pleasant social company. He would see it as being part of the brief to 
deal with things diligently and clinically.
"He wouldn't be afraid of anybody. The idea that he would be spooked by Dermot Desmond or Denis O'Brien would 
be completely wrong. He is politically astute and ruthless," said the insider.
When the time came for change at INM, Osborne played a key role in choosing a successor at the newspaper 
group. He felt that it should be someone who knew the business -- and he didn't want O'Reilly's departure to leave 
a void. Vincent Crowley's experience at the helm of a plc in the form of APN -- the group's Australian subsidiary -- 
weighed in his favour.
It is understood that Osborne rankled at the notion that O'Reilly's departure represented a change of control at INM. 
"There is no way under his chairmanship that there would be a change of control," said a person with insight into 
Osborne's thinking. This appears to have been borne out in his reaction to last week's court challenge.
There is now much fear among INM staffers that Crowley, with Osborne's backing, will severely cut editorial 
resources. But Osborne is said to believe that the newspapers are a "carefully crafted product", which have to be 
balanced against what the company can afford.
He was taken aback at the Sunday Independent edition of April 1, in which there were 15 articles with some 
reference to O'Brien. One source said that Osborne believed there should be no interference in editorial, but that 
the O'Brien coverage was "excessive by any standard".
Osborne sees himself as someone who cannot sit back on the board and simply enjoy the trappings of such roles, 
according to a close friend.
He drives an 02 Audi and does not see himself as someone who is drawn in by wealth, although he enjoys some 
expensive hobbies.
Board games: James Osborne profiled
Friends said he is happiest when he is "a thousand miles from land". He shares a 56-foot yacht with three others. 
Those who know about sailing say it is a beautiful vessel; almost a sister ship of the Gipsy Moth in which Sir 
Frances Chichester became the first man to sail around the world single-handedly, non-stop.
Osborne has a long history with Punchestown. He is a fan of national hunt racing and has invested in some horses, 
although has no interest in flat racing. He enjoys golf, playing off a handicap of 13, and is an avid tennis plater. His 
partner is former model and Sunday Independent columnist Patricia Devine, and they have a young child together. 
He also has grown up children from his marriage.
As well as sitting on the boards of Ryanair and INM, he is on the board of an Australian company domiciled here, 
James Hardie, and also chairs Centric health. He is chairman of Eason, where he has been central to a 
restructuring of the company. He also sits on the board of the Royal College of Surgeons.
Close associates say he is a great believer in Ireland's ability to recover from this protracted recession. He also 
expects that INM will get back on track when investors pull together and cost savings are implemented. Which of 
those hopes materialises first remains to be seen.

From Mr Stephen McNamara.
Sir, BAA Stansted's recent claim that being "freed from regulation" and "better rail links" would allow it to double 
traffic is laughable. The Civil Aviation Authority's ineffective regulation only sets maximum price caps and the BAA 
has complete freedom to discount its high charges if it really wants to increase traffic, but instead BAA doubled 
prices and presided over record declines, which have seen Stansted traffic fall from 24m passengers in 2007 to 
fewer than 18m last year.
Might we suggest that, instead of advocating traffic growth strategies, which it clearly knows very little about, the 
BAA's time would be better spent complying with the Competition Commission's 2006 recommendation to sell 
Stansted, rather than wasting yet more time and money pursuing a seventh appeal against this sale order later this 
year. The BAA monopoly has failed at Stansted, and it's now time to let new owners work with airlines to deliver 
lower costs and rapid traffic growth.

Flag carrier Qantas is on an apparent collision course with the New South Wales (NSW) government insofar as the 
construction of a second Sydney airport is concerned.
Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce is pushing for the construction of the second gateway at Badgerys Creek, while 
NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell is against the idea of building a second airport during his term due to aircraft noise the 
gateway would generate.
Mr Joyce, in an article for The Daily Telegraph, justified the push for a second gateway to alleviate the suffering of 
air passengers who are inconvenienced by peak-hour bottlenecks at Sydney Airport. He stressed that jet noise has 
been reduced to half in the past decade and would even be further cut until it would not even be an issue.
"We cannot judge today's aircraft by the standards of the 1980s and 1990s.... Aircraft flying today are only half as 
loud as those of 10 years ago and the Qantas fleet is younger and quieter that it has even been before," Mr Joyce 
wrote.
He added that by 2030, new jets would be even quieter than current models. By combining planning controls and 
good air traffic control, aircraft noise would cease to be an issue, Mr Joyce insisted. He cited the Airbus A380 
whose noise is only half of the Boeing 747, the jet's predecessor, an even higher 60 per cent noise reduction for the 
Boeing 787 versus the Boeing 767, and 75 per cent less noise for the A320neo compared with the current A320s.
Qantas has 12 A380s in its fleet, which is the same model used by other air carriers that also fly to Sydney such as 
Emirates and Singapore Airlines. Qantas has ordered 50 787s and 78 A320neos.
Despite the release of a joint federal-state 3,200-page study on a second airport with the findings that jet noises had 
been reduced significantly, Mr O'Farrell is adamant in his stand and would rather expand the Canberra Airport and 
build a high-speed rail system to the capital city.
The report said Canberra and Newcastle are too far from Sydney, Bankstown and Richmond could only play small 
roles, while Wilton - located southwest of Sydney - is the next strongest option.

Unless work starts now, the study warned that by 2014, during morning peaks, the queue at General Holmes Drive 
to the domestic terminals would be four kilometers long and more than three kilometers for the Airport Drive road.
"I don't think Canberra works as an alternative, it's too far away, it's over 280 km (away). I come from Ireland, where 
Ryanair takes pleasure in finding secondary airports miles away from airports in the city... but I don't even think 
Ryanair would go 280 km away," Mr Joyce countered.
Federal Transport Minister Anthony Albanese sided with Qantas in pushing for a second Sydney airport, but the 
premier criticised the federal government for failure to promise funds to address the infrastructure that Qantas 
seeks whether it would be built in Sydney or other Australian cities.

THE dismantling of BAA's British interests moved forward yesterday when it agreed to sell Edinburgh airport to City 
airport owner Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for a surprise £807m.
GIP, an investment fund founded by Credit Suisse and General Electric, beat a consortium led by JP Morgan Asset 
Management's infrastructure fund. The price dwarfs the £500m figure expected in the City and reflects the intense 
competition for the airport, which also attracted the interest of buyout groups 3i and Carlyle.
GIP is expected to quicken the amount of time passengers spend in check-in, security and baggage handling.
Chairman Adebayo Ogunlesi said: "We see significant opportunity to apply our tested and successful operational 
expertise and our knowledge of the global airports sector to develop and enhance the performance of Edinburgh 
Airport."
The airport attracted 9.3m passengers last year and generated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation of £48.3m. It was recently snubbed by Ryanair, which reduced its flights there, but yesterday the 
budget carrier said the deal would free it from the "dead hand" of BAA.
JP Morgan Asset Management had led a consortium including Incheon, South Korea's airport authority and US 
teachers' pension fund TIAA-Cref. However, TIAA-Cref pulled out earlier this month.
BAA, part of Spanish infrastructure company Ferrovial, owns Heathrow, Stansted, Southampton, Glasgow and 
Aberdeen airports.
BAA offloads Edinburgh for shock £800m
It was made to sell one of its Scottish airports by the Competition Commission, and is contesting a ruling that it 
must offload Stansted. If Stansted comes on the market then GIP is unlikely to be allowed to bid because of its 
controlling stakes in Gatwick, which it bought from BAA for £1.5bn in 2009, as well as City airport.

The ISEQ index of top Irish shares turned higher this morning amid relief that Spain sold its bonds at a debt auction 
even though yields ticked higher again.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was up 26.64 points to 3,251.49.
Shares in Ireland's biggest company, CRH, rose 5c to E15.26 after the US Government approved a further 90-day 
extension that would take authorisation of the transportation programmes from July 1st to September 30th. As the 
current extension is not due to expire until the end of June, there was no need for such a move. Some 
commentators believe that this is a sign that the House wants to get a multi-year programme approved by the end 
of the fiscal year. "CRH's European operations are also likely to have been impacted by the adverse weather but its 
significant exposure to the Netherlands is an additional headwind (9-10pc of group profits). Our forecasts for the FY 
expect like for like sales to decline by circa 1pc in Europe," according to Goodbody's.
Shares in irish bookies, Paddy Power, climbed 71c to E48.31 after its British peer, Ladbrokes, reported a solid Q1 
performance with group net revenue +9pc and operating profit +4pc. The company has stated that at this early 
stage of the year it is in line with guidance for the group for 2012. Tax guidance has been lowered by 1pc to 12pc, 
which will lead to a 1-2pc increase in our Adj. EPS (2012 currently 16.7p). UK retail net revenue was +9pc in Q1 
(our H1 forecast is +5pc yoy) and was driven by strong machine growth, +22pc yoy with average gross win per 
machine £923 v £791 in Q1 (Q4: £930). While comparatives are set to get more difficult due to the annualising of 
the rollout (Feb - May), the performance is very encouraging. The OTC performance remained resilient, with net 
revenue +0.5pc, with margins flat yoy at 17.2pc and amounts staked +0.6pc yoy. The Ryanair deputy CEO, Michael 
Cawley, has told analysts that slowing capacity growth would allow Ryanair to better manage yields, or to 
paraphrase him, provides the opportunity for "pruning the roses". There have been announcements recently about 
cuts at Edinburgh airport, for example, but an analysis by Anna Aero highlights that Ryanair has indeed been

actively "pruning its roses" as the fleet growth tapers off. The report evaluates weekly departures this August and 
shows capacity in the month is set to grow by 7pc yoy. "Firstly, this tallies with our forecasts, with 6.5pc capacity 
growth pencilled into our models for H1 and flat for H2, delivering 3.7pc growth for the year (FY13 to March). More 
importantly, though, the analysis shows that Ryanair is launching 269 new routes in August, but is dropping 130 
routes, driving a net 139 increase in the month. About 150 of the new routes have been launched in recent weeks 
from its five new bases. Bringing this on further, the number of routes being operated is increasing by 12pc, but with 
flights set to increase by just 7pc, the average frequency is set to drop by around 4pc. Put another way, of the 28 
countries served by the airline, 17 will see more flights this summer (Spain, Hungary and Italy the most), with 9 set 
to see a lower intensity (Morocco, Ireland and UK) and 2 will be flat," said Goodbody's. "In our view, this route by 
route analysis shows that the slowing capacity growth at Ryanair is delivering opportunities to maximise the route 
network." Shares in Ryanair rose 6c to E4.33.

performance with group net revenue +9pc and operating profit +4pc. The company has stated that at this early 
stage of the year it is in line with guidance for the group for 2012. Tax guidance has been lowered by 1pc to 12pc, 
which will lead to a 1-2pc increase in broker's EPS (2012 currently 16.7p). UK retail net revenue was +9pc in Q1 
(compared to brokers' forecast of 5pc year on year - yoy) and was driven by strong machine growth, +22pc yoy with 
average gross win per machine £923 v £791 in Q1 (Q4: £930). Ryanair deputy CEO, Michael Cawley, has told 
analysts that slowing capacity growth would allow Ryanair to better manage yields, or to paraphrase him, provides 
the opportunity for "pruning the roses". Shares in Ryanair rose 4c to E4.31. Packaging group Smurfit Kappa has 
reported Q1 results and made some positive comments regarding pricing and volumes trends in containerboard 
and corrugated in its conference call. Packaging Corporation of America (PKG) indicated on its conference call that 
its export customers have already been advised that containerboard prices will rise in the second quarter. "While 
ISEQ loses grip on rebound by close ISEQ Falls
SCA reported results broadly in-line with expectations, there was little by way of detail on the packaging business 
which is currently being sold to DS Smith. This division is now treated as a discontinued operation. In the 
conference call, however, management made some comments regarding pricing and volume trends," said Davy's 
Barry Dixon. Its shares fell 20c to E6.68 Nutreco, a "global leader in animal nutrition and fish feed", reported a year-
on-year volume increase in its fish feed division of 26pc in Q1 2012. "This indicates a very positive trading 
environment for Origin's associate in marine protein (Welcon AS, in which it has a 50pc interest). Welcon is the 
leading producer of fishmeal and fish oil in the North Atlantic area. Fishmeal and fish oil are key raw material 
ingredients of fish feed," said Davy's Aiden O'Donnell. Origin Enterprises shares rose 7c to E3.90.

A loophole that allowed Ryanair to pay the lower level of social security contributions for hundreds of its Continental 
European staff was today closed by a vote by MEPs.
The airline has 8,500 of its cabin crew and pilots on Irish work contracts irrespective of where they reside, on the 
basis that the low-cost airline is registered in Dublin.
Ireland has among the lowest employer social welfare contributions in the EU.
airlines will have to pay their staff's social contributions based on the country staff are located in - the base from 
which they fly and to which they return after their work shift. It is designed to prevent air crew being insured by 
"letter-box companies" or being subject to legislation of a country in which they do not live. Ryanair criticised the 
change. Spokesman Peter McNamara said: "This is another example of how the EU introduces regulations which 
serve no purpose other than to increase the cost of air travel and reduce competitiveness between EU states." 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary recently advised Belgian airline SN to move its headquarters to Ireland 
and give their staff Irish work contracts. "It's much cheaper," he said.

The ISEQ index barely got off the mark today after Tuesday's rebound as investors adopted a wait and see attitude 
amid continued unease over the euro debt crisis.
The index rose 2.21 points to 3,224.85.
Fears of a resurgence in the euro zone debt crisis boosted demand for safe-haven German bonds on Wednesday, 
while the Bank of England and a European Central Bank official signalled more monetary policy easing measures 
were unlikely. The single currency also fell against the dollar as growing bad loan problems at Spanish banks 
added to the country's economic woes, and French president Nicolas Sarkozy, fighting for re-election, warned a 
strong euro hurt exporters.
According to recent reports, CRH's US Products division has acquired TXI Package Products from Texas 
Industries. The business comprises five facilities and sells a mix of bagged products including dry mix concrete, 
cement, bulk mortar and private-label products that are sold through distributors. No financial details are given. 
"This is a typical bolt-on deal for CRH and our forecasts incorporate E500m in 2012 and E800m in 2013 for such 
expenditure, which adds 1c and 6c to forecasts, respectively," said Goodbody's Robert Eason. CRH's shares 
dipped 10c to E15.27. BAA's Edinburgh airport has attracted 2 bids as the deadline for offers expires according to 
Bloomberg. The airport is the first of three required to be sold by BAA/Ferrovial as part of a competition review over 
the last number of years. However, we are more interested in the reports in the FT this morning relating to Stansted 
where the CEO indicated yesterday that they would consider taking a minority stake in the airport if required by 
future owners. Stansted carried 18m passengers last year, down from a peak of 24m in 2007 and is operating at 
half capacity. Presently, Ryanair accounts for about three-quarters of Stansted's business, so the Ryanair CEO's 
comments reflect a recognition by new owners of the importance to bed down a key tenant, according to 
Goodbody's. Shares in Ryanair fell 3c to E4.29 and Aer Lingus dipped 1c to E1.00. Heineken's consolidated beer 
ISEQ flat ahead of Spanish auction ISEQ Flat
volume grew 6.2pc to 35.9m hectolitres (hl) in the first quarter. Organically consolidated beer volume increased by 
4.7pc. Volume of the Heineken brand in the International Premium Segment (IPS) grew 8.7pc, outperforming the 
broader beer market. Revenue increased 6.8pc to E3834m (consensus: E3736m), reflecting organic growth of 
6.8pc (consensus: +3pc) as well as a positive scope effect of +0.5pc and exchange rate movements of -0.5pc. 
Shares in Irish drinks group, C and C rose 2c to E3.73. Press reports indicate that new figures submitted to the 
Department of Finance, by the administrators of Quinn Insurance Limited (QIL), could see a potential demand on 
the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) of up to E1bn, from the current expected E785m estimate. The new 
figures emanate from "more certainty" on what the maximum cost is likely to be and also because the claims 
experience has slightly worsened. The claims left with QIL mainly relate to UK professional indemnity, commercial 
and motor business, with some deterioration in the claims particularly written in 2006-08. Shares in FBD rose 9c to

The ISEQ made only modest gains this morning after yesterday's rebound as investors adopted a wait and see 
attitude amid continued unease over the euro debt crisis.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 5.39 points to 3,228.03.
Fears of a resurgence in the euro zone debt crisis boosted demand for safe-haven German bonds on Wednesday, 
while the Bank of England and a European Central Bank official signalled more monetary policy easing measures 
were unlikely. The single currency also fell against the dollar as growing bad loan problems at Spanish banks 
added to the country's economic woes, and French president Nicolas Sarkozy, fighting for re-election, warned a 
strong euro hurt exporters.
According to recent reports, CRH's US Products division has acquired TXI Package Products from Texas 
Industries. The business comprises five facilities and sells a mix of bagged products including dry mix concrete, 
cement, bulk mortar and private-label products that are sold through distributors. No financial details are given. 
"This is a typical bolt-on deal for CRH and our forecasts incorporate E500m in 2012 and E800m in 2013 for such 
expenditure, which adds 1c and 6c to forecasts, respectively," said Goodbody's Robert Eason. CRH's shares 
dipped 17c to E15.20. BAA's Edinburgh airport has attracted 2 bids as the deadline for offers expires according to 
Bloomberg. The airport is the first of three required to be sold by BAA/Ferrovial as part of a competition review over 
the last number of years. However, we are more interested in the reports in the FT this morning relating to Stansted 
where the CEO indicated yesterday that they would consider taking a minority stake in the airport if required by 
future owners. Stansted carried 18m passengers last year, down from a peak of 24m in 2007 and is operating at 
half capacity. Presently, Ryanair accounts for about three-quarters of Stansted's business, so the Ryanair CEO's 
comments reflect a recognition by new owners of the importance to bed down a key tenant, according to 
Goodbody's. Shares in Ryanair fell 4c to E4.28 and Aer Lingus dipped 1c to E1.00.

Ryanair would be open to taking a stake in Stansted airport if prospective owners wanted the reassurance of a 
partnership with the airport's biggest customer, said Michael O'Leary, the low-cost carrier's chief executive, 
yesterday.
While London's third-biggest airport by number of passengers is not yet up for sale, regulators have told owner BAA 
to dispose of it, assuming the company's final appeal against a 2009 Competition Commission ruling is rejected.
Stansted could attract significant interest, particularly if the government decides a new runway there is the solution 
to the south-east's air capacity woes. Stansted currently operates at half capacity, a situation Mr O'Leary blames on 
BAA's doubling of fees in recent years, thus driving away airline customers.
"We've talked to a number of interested bidders, and some are interested in Ryanair as a minority partner," said Mr 
O'Leary. "It's not something we want to do, but if a consortium wants us in as a shareholder we would consider it." 
Ryanair flights constitute three-quarters of Stansted's business.
Mr O'Leary also hit out at Stansted's recent plea to the government to invest in the airport's rail link to central 
London, with the goal of reducing journey times to 30 minutes from at least 45. "We have not received one letter 
from one customer complaining about the train," he said. "We don't need the UK government wasting money on 
spurious infrastructure."
Stansted's passenger numbers have fallen from 24m in 2007 to 18m last year, a drop it blames on wider economic 
decline and its high exposure to leisure travellers. But Mr O'Leary noted that low-cost carriers saw growth in that 
period.

Iberia hardens stance on pilots' pay

Iberia, owned by International Airlines Group which is also the holding company of British Airways, is looking to cut 
pilots' pay by a fifth.
The airline is taking a hard line in its battle with the pilots' union over cost cuts and the launch of a budget carrier 
airline to compete with Ryanair and EasyJet.
Alongside the pay cut, which includes an across-the-board reduction in pay scales and changes to perks for pilots 
with 15 years' seniority, the airline is proposing to increase the number of hours that pilots are expected to fly every 
year and eliminate extra holidays for senior staff.
Under recent reforms to Spanish labour law, companies are allowed to propose changes to contracts with 
employees if the groups have experienced two consecutive quarters of either losses or falling revenue - both apply 
to Iberia.
The proposals are an opening gambit in 15 days' negotiation with Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union. That will be 
followed by another week of talks if an agreement cannot be reached, after which an arbitration committee will step 
in. Iberia expects a resolution in 50 days' time.
Antagonism between management and Sepla is intense, with the union starting a series of strikes last week to 
protest against the launch of Iberia Express, which offers worse pay and conditions than the mainline carrier.
Pilots are planning to strike every Monday and Friday for three-and-a-half months, an action that could cost the 
airline up to EUR90m. IAG says it will not back down given the damage high costs have done to profitability on 
Iberia's short- and medium-haul network.
Analysts yesterday agreed that the airline should take action. "Being an airline, you have to continuously cut costs," 
said Gert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon. "It's non-stop."
Iberia hardens stance on pilots' pay
Iberia said the payroll cuts would reduce costs by EUR62m at an airline that produced an operating loss of 
EUR61m last year . It expects the changed working arrangements to increase productivity by a quarter. José María 
Fariza, finance director, said the changes were "the sole means of ensuring success in the difficult situation".
Douglas McNeill, an analyst at Charles Stanley, estimated that Iberia's short-haul division lost EUR100m last year. 
"Saving this kind of money would still leave work to be done, but it would constitute very significant progress," he 
said.
He added that while the proposals might be an aggressive first move by the airline, "Iberia pilots are already striking 
with such regularity that management doesn't have much to lose by upping the ante".

The main Dublin shares index rebounded back above the 3,200 level this morning as some risk appetite returned 
amid good news on the German economy and Spanish debt.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 47.16 points to 3,223.25.
European stocks rose as an upbeat German economic sentiment reading and adequate demand at a Spanish 
government debt auction helped to ease risk aversion and lure investors back in to the equity market after a month-
long sell-off. Technical strategists, however, said it was too soon to call the end of the downward trend, with the 
latest move likely to prove just a temporary correction.
At home, shares in C and C rose 4c to E3.72, Grafton climbed 7c to E3.22 and Abbey dropped 7c to E5.78. These 
firms are all heavily embedded in the UK market and its economy. UK GDP will expand by 0.5pc in 2012 and 1.2pc 
in 2013, according to Davy Reearch. UK GDP growth in 2011 equalled 0.7pc, exactly in line with our last forecasts 
in October. The UK looks set to avoid a 'technical' double-dip recession, with GDP expected to rise marginally in Q1 
2012 following a 0.3pc contraction in Q4 2011. But Davy expect UK GDP growth to undershoot the current 
consensus forecast of 1.8pc growth in 2013. Shares in Ryanair rose 6c to E4.35. An Israeli newspaper, The Marker, 
has indicated that Ryanair is evaluating whether to fly to Israel. It suggests that a senior Ryanair official visited 
Israel in secret before Passover and met with the Director of the Civil Aviation Authority. According to the media 
reports, under a recent aviation agreement between Israel and the EU, the first stage will include the addition of 
possible flights to secondary airports in both jurisdictions. Presently, easyJet flies to Israel, as does Nikki Airlines. 
The move by Ryanair clearly appears to be exploratory and follows comments previously from the management 
team that it would consider flights to Turkey, but mainly from Germany, given its resistance to flying more than 
short-medium haul, according to Goodbody's. "The airline's average sector length has been consistently around

airline having recently expanded in this region, after the opportunity presented by the demise of Malev and a new

all the security considerations in Israel," said analyst, Eamonn Hughes. There were mixed trends in the data 
releases this week on the US construction sector. The breakdown of the March retail figures shows that volumes of 
"Building Materials & Garden Equipment" continued to see strong momentum with yoy growth of 14pc versus 12pc 
in February and 11pc in January. However, the housebuilder confidence index came in weaker than expected at 25 
for April versus consensus of 28 and it represented a three-month low. Shares in CRH rose 32c to E15.37.

The main Dublin shares index rebounded back above the 3,200 level yesterday as some risk appetite returned 
amid good news on the German economy and Spanish debt.
European stocks rose as an upbeat German economic sentiment reading and adequate demand at a Spanish 
government debt auction helped to ease risk aversion and lure investors back in to the equity market after a month-
long sell-off. Technical strategists, however, said it was too soon to call the end of the downward trend, with the 
latest move likely to prove just a temporary correction.
At home, shares in C and C rose 3c to E3.71, Grafton climbed 6c to E3.21 and Abbey was flat at E5.85. These

RYANAIR yesterday cut 60 weekly flights from Edinburgh Airport in a bid to force operator BAA to lower its fees.
The low-cost carrier warned that its move to axe eight routes from its winter schedule could cost up to 500 jobs at 
the airport.
Ryanair blamed BAA's "uncompetitive" fees, and said its annual passenger traffic at Edinburgh would fall by 
500,000 on a year ago due to the cuts.
Edinburgh, however, was already braced for Ryanair's more modest winter plans. "It was expected as we saw 
similar cuts in last year's winter schedule," said managing director Jim O'Sullivan.
Edinburgh Airport is expected to change hands this year after BAA put it on the market following a competition 
ruling.
Ryanair argued that its routes needed to be finalised before the sale, as its current deal ends in October. "We need 
to sign a new contract now to allow us to plan our winter schedules, irrespective of who owns the airport… We need 
to have our planning and schedules in place," said a spokesperson.
O'Sullivan said the airport is "look[ing] forward to further negotiations with Ryanair once the sale of the airport is 
concluded."
He added that Ryanair is being asked to pay the same air traffic control costs as every other airline. Earlier in the 
week, BAA said March traffic at Edinburgh had fallen 2.8 per cent on last year.

Monarch Airlines has appointed a new finance director in a management reshuffle that will also give chairman Iain 
Rawlinson permanent chief executive responsibilities.
The privately held charter carrier and scheduled operator is in the middle of a two-year turnround plan to return it to 
profit next year.
High fuel prices, a difficult consumer environment and competition from airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet 
contributed to an operating loss of £45m in the year to October 2011.
In November, the company's owners injected £75m to shore up finances and allow Monarch to launch 14 routes 
and to add narrow-body jets to a 28-aircraft fleet.
It also unveiled   plans under which the group would aim to offer shorter flights to increase revenues per seat mile - 
a task that has been helped by its bigger rivals raising their own fares - and to reduce costs.
"We are starting to see the benefits of our work . . . coming through in results," Mr Rawlinson said yesterday.
He added that the group was "keen to maintain consistency and stability in the top team" but wanted the 
"experience, strength and clarity" of Robert Palmer as finance director.
Mr Palmer, a veteran of EasyJet, BMI and Air Malta, has been a consultant to Monarch for seven months and takes 
over from Simon Tucker, who is leaving   .
The chief operating officer, Richard Mintern, is also leaving. His main responsibilities of overseeing the group's 
three divisions - the airline, package tours and aircraft engineering - will be handed to an expanded finance team.
Monarch aims for profit with reshuffle
Douglas McNeill, an airline analyst with Charles Stanley, said that "as a relatively small, leisure-focused airline 
facing high passenger taxes, high fuel costs and bigger, ever more efficient rivals, [Monarch is] probably finding life 
quite tough at present."
However, he said the group's shareholders, dominated by the Swiss-Italian Mantegazza family, appeared ready to 
fund it through difficult times.
A decade ago, Monarch shifted its focus from chartered flights to being a scheduled airline. Now Mr Rawlinson 
wants passengers to regard the brand as a step above its low-cost rivals but as a cheaper alternative to full-service 
carriers.
"I'm not sure there's a niche there," countered Mr McNeill. "The difference [between budget and full-service airlines] 
is obvious for business travellers, but it's a lot less distinct in the leisure market."
Other small European carriers are struggling to cope with high fuel prices. Two - Hungary's Malév and Catalonia-
based Spanair - have collapsed this year .

IT isn't easy to pinpoint value on this afternoon's Aintree card, but I don't think the bookmakers have got it right in 
the John Smith's Melling Chase (3.05pm). I'm a big fan of Finian's Rainbow, but he has always struck me as a 
genuine twomiler and he has been beaten both times he has been stepped up to 2m4f plus. He's 5/4 with Coral, but 
it's a long punishing straight at Aintree and I'm happy to take him on with the remarkable ALBERTAS RUN.
Jonjo O'Neill's 11-year-old has never been given the credit he deserves, but he has won three times at the 
Cheltenham Festival and was only just touched off by Riverside Theatre in the Ryanair this year. He also won this 
race in 2010 and finished second to Master Minded last year. He is a tremendously gutsy horse and is worth a bet 
at 10/3 with Paddy Power.
It was a real shame that FINGAL BAY didn't make it to Cheltenham as it would have been fascinating to see him 
take on Simonsig in the Neptune Novices' Hurdle. Compensation awaits, however, in this afternoon's John Smith's 
Sefton Novices' Hurdle (4.15pm). The step up to three miles promises to suit and the rain that came earlier in the 
week has made the ground perfect for Philip Hobbs' runner.
Nicky Henderson had a memorable Grand National Saturday 12 months ago, despite not even having a runner in 
the big one.
He landed the first three races on the card with Spirit Son, Finian's Rainbow and OSCAR WHISKY and there is 
every chance he can pull off the same treble tomorrow.
Both Simonsig and Sprinter Sacre are sure to go off very short prices in the opening two contests, but Oscar 
Whisky is certainly backable at 9/4 with Coral in the John Smith's Aintree Hurdle (2.45pm). There seems little doubt 
that Dai Walters' pride and joy is best at 2m4f and it looked as though he simply didn't stay when taking on Big 
Buck's in the World Hurdle last month.
Oscar Whisky primed to land another Aintree Hurdle
He showed real guts when winning this race last year, sticking his neck out to hold off the challenge of Thousand 
Stars.
That rival takes him on again, but I'd expect my selection to confirm the form. Rock On Ruby has to be a danger on 
his Champion Hurdle form, but he had a tough race that day and I'd actually be more scared of his stablemate 
Zarkandar. If Sporting Index offer a match bet on the two Nicholls runners, I'd definitely favour last year's Triumph 
Hurdle winner.
¦ Pointers… ALBERTAS RUN 3.05pm Aintree (today) FINGAL BAY 4.15pm Aintree (today) OSCAR WHISKY 
2.45pm Aintree (tomorrow)

Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, today said it is to close eight routes and 60 weekly flights to and from Edinburgh over 
what it says are high airport costs levied by operator, BAA.
It said it was axing flights to Bratislava in Slovakia, Bremen and Frankfurt in Germany, Fuerteventura in the Canary 
Islands, Gothenburg in Sweden, Kaunas in Lithuania, and Lodz and Poznan in Poland.
The move comes just two months after the airline halted five of their summer routes.
Ryanair claims the latest round of closures will equate to 500,000 less passengers going through the airport every 
year and lead to 500 jobs "on-site" losses. The 60 flights a week will stop running from October 2012 and deputy 
CEO Michael Cawley said the company hoped to reverse the cuts if operators BAA reduce their costs. "Ryanair 
regrets BAA Edinburgh Airport's rejection of our proposals for a competitive cost base which would allow Ryanair to 
further grow our traffic and routes for winter 2012 and beyond. Sadly, BAA Edinburgh seems to prefer higher costs, 
even if it means fewer passengers and jobs at Edinburgh," said deputy CEO Michael Cawley. "While Ryanair 
remains committed to Edinburgh Airport (with 1.3m passengers and 17 routes this winter, we remain one of the 
largest airlines operating to/from Edinburgh), the BAA Edinburgh monopoly cannot continue to ignore the 
competitive marketplace, where airports all over the UK and Europe have been reducing costs and lowering 
charges in return for traffic growth. We hope there is a way to reverse these cuts to ensure further Ryanair growth 
at Edinburgh."

AVIATION has changed massively since the era of Pan Am, a byword for style and sophistication in its 1960s 
heyday. The once besuited passengers have been replaced by an understandably angry mob, fighting to fit their 
suitcases into fluorescent-coloured over-head cabins. It is out with the caviar and freshly cooked roast beef and in 
with the over-priced soggy sandwich.
Yet airlines are still status symbols, which is why they are founded and owned by some of the most colourful 
characters in business, including Richard Branson (Virgin Atlantic), Tony Fernandes (Air Asia), the late Tony Ryan 
(Ryanair), Stelios Haji-Ioannou (EasyJet) and Vijay Mallya (Kingfisher Airlines). It is no coincidence that two of 
these figures, Fernandes and Mallya, also have interests in British football clubs, another trophy asset that is 
guaranteed to lose money.
It has to be the sex appeal that attracts them, because it certainly isn't the easy profit. It was Warren Buffett who 
said the "amount of money made by all US airlines since the dawn of aviation is zero".
C. R. Smith, the late chairman of American Airlines, would have concurred, warning in 1970 that "nobody can make 
money in the goddamn airline business these days. The economics represent sheer hell." If he were alive today, he 
would be unsurprised that his airline is now technically bankrupt.
Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines is the latest to fall victim to the torrid conditions for the airline industry. Yesterday it flew 
its last ever international flight, the 12.50pm Delhi to Heathrow. In India, it is being forced to pay its airport fees in 
cash before being allowed to land.
The economics of the airline industry are sheer hell
The story behind Kingfisher's downfall is well-rehearsed. A cripplingly high oil price coupled with reckless over-
expansion meant even the considerable profits of the eponymous brewing empire could not keep its planes in the 
skies.
Even successful airlines are finding it tough going. Ryanair was forced to ground 80 planes over the winter months 
while Branson's Virgin Atlantic is struggling to find a new equity partner. Air Asia might be the darling of the industry 
at the moment, but when it handed Airbus its biggest ever order at the Paris air show last year, for 200 A320s, it 
smacked of over-expansion. Flybe, the latest UK airline to go public, added two per cent yesterday after it said 
losses would be in line with expectations, but its stock closed at 71p - well below its 295p listing price in December 
2010.
Things will only get worse, with oil - which accounts for a third of costs - at $120 a barrel and rising. The aviation 
analyst's favourite joke rings more true now than ever before. How do you amass a small fortune? Take a large 
fortune and buy an airline.

The ISEQ see-sawed in and out of the red in the last day of trading in the week, falling back below the 3,200 level 
at one stage amid investor jitters over what could be a return of January's eurozone debt crisis.
The ISEQ fell 0.28 of a point to 3,202.47.
European shares fell, with concerns about Spain and its ability to meet budget targets hitting the euro zone 
peripheral indexes, while more losses were expected after the FTSEurofirst 300 index broke a support level. A 
dismal Spanish bond sale on Wednesday heightened concerns about funding difficulties for weaker euro zone 
countries, with investors seeing an easing of the effects of the European Central Bank's huge liquidity injections. 
Sentiment was also hurt by fading expectations of more stimulus from the U.S. Federal Reserve. With markets set 
to close for the Easter break, investors were unwilling to hold onto long positions.
DCC's shares fell 12c to E18.68 after it emerged that the proposed purchase by Dublin-listed fuel distributor, DCC, 
of Total Downstream UK has been referred to the British Competition Commission by Britain's Office of Fair Trading 
(OFT). Total Downstream own both GB Oils and Total Butler, which both supply oil products, including heating oil 
and transport fuel, to a range of domestic, commercial and agricultural customers in the UK. Each has a sizeable 
network of oil depots in England and Wales, numbering over 100 depots in the case of GB Oils and 40 for Total 
Butler. The Greenery, a large Dutch fresh produce concern, saw a dramatic fall in profits in 2011 as a result of the 
e-coli scare that hit the sector during the summer. In 2011, The Greenery recorded a net result of E1.9m, down 
from E4.8m in 2010. Sales fell to E1.6bn from E1.8bn in 2010. The incidental effect of the EHEC crisis amounted to 
E6m and this was partly responsible for a 6pc fall in volumes. Timing was poor as the crisis hit just as the Dutch 
season was coming into full production. In its outlook, the company expects a slight increase in profitability, albeit 
off a lower turnover. Profits will be impacted by continued investment in the business, primarily around the rollout 
out of a new operating system. The annual report gives some detail on the impact of the EHEC crisis. The Greenery

saw its export volumes to Germany, a key trading partner, decrease by nearly 25pc. Consumers are demanding 
more traceability of product - something which should benefit the larger players. Of relevance to Total Produce, the 
statement notes "healthy growth" in Scandinavia. Total's shares rose 1c to E0.46. Ryanair reported that March 
passengers decreased by 4pc to 5.5m and load factor fell by 1pp to 78pc. This is broadly consistent with our 
expectations and the company's guidance that it expected to ground up to 80 aircraft in the winter due to higher fuel 
prices. Aer Lingus passenger numbers were up 8pc in March compared to the same month a year ago. Shares in 
Ryanair rose 5c to E4.44 and Aer Lingus edged down 1c to E0.95.

WILLIE Walsh picked up a £1.155m pay package for last year but missed out on £1.35m of bonus payments after 
International Airlines Group (IAG) failed to hit some performance targets.
The group chief executive received a base salary of £825,000 and a £302,000 bonus, according to the annual 
report of the owner of British Airways and Iberia, which was published yesterday. He missed out on the rest, 
however, after IAG did not meet "stretching" targets including measures on profits.
Keith Williams and Rafael Sánchez-Lozano Turmo, the individual heads of BA and Iberia, received packages of 
(EURO)1.12m and (EURO)870,000 respectively, including bonuses of (EURO)218,000 and (EURO)79,000 
respectively, The group reported pre-tax profits of £425.6m in the year to December 2011. When the results were 
revealed in February, Walsh said: "BA is making money and Iberia is losing money. The Spanish economy is weak 
and operating costs at Iberia are too high, unacceptably so, but this is being tackled."
Yesterday IAG's annual report also showed that Walsh and Sánchez-Lozano Turmo asked for their basic salaries 
for 2012 to be frozen at 2011 levels.
It came as IAG posted a strong rise in March traffic, boosted by continued growth in first and business class travel 
and a buoyant transatlantic market. Traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, rose by 6.2 per cent versus 
March 2011, while passenger load factor - a measure of how well it fills its planes - was up one percentage point at 
73.7 per cent, it said yesterday.
Its Spanish operations face the threat of up to 30 days of strikes between April and July, however.
Willie Walsh's bonus cut after Iberia troubles
•Low cost airline Ryanair said yesterday its passenger traffic during March fell four per cent, as its decision to 
ground planes to save on fuel costs continued to dent its growth. Ryanair said it carried 5.7m passengers during 
March, with 79 per cent of its available seats taken - down one percentage point on a year ago.

No-frills Irish airline, Ryanair, this morning said it carried 4pc fewer passengers on its aircraft in March than it did in 
the same month a year earlier.
However, it said that this was as a result of strategic cuts in capacity rather than a fall off in demand.
The airline carried 5.5 million passengers in the month compared to 5.7 million in March of 2011.
For the 12 months to the end of March it carried 75.8 million travellers, it said. The airline's load factor - an industry-
wide measure of how well airlines fill their aircraft - fell 1pc to 78pc last month and the load factor for the 12 months 
to the end of last month stood at 82pc, ryanair said. "As previously guided, Ryanair's 2011/12 winter traffic was 
expected to decline by around 5pc as we sit up to 80 aircraft on the ground due to higher oil prices," Ryanair's 
Stephen McNamara said.

Body
(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) on Tuesday called on the EU Commission to 
prevent French Air Traffic Controllers from going on strike again this week.
Ryanair condemned the EU Commission's continuing failure to act on its repeated call for the removal of the right to 
strike from Europe's air traffic controllers, "who repeatedly blackmail Europe's passengers with strikes throughout 
the summer season."
The company noted that many of Europe's police forces and army personnel are not allowed to strike. Air traffic 
controllers in the U.S. are also prevented by law from striking. The European Commission should apply similar no 
strike rules in Europe, the airline urged.
Ryanair confirmed that yesterday's French Air Traffic Control strike caused 134 flights to be cancelled, with a further 
450 flights delayed. This resulted in 88,000 Ryanair passengers having their flights disrupted on Monday.

GDF SUEZ UBS rates the energy group "buy" and has a 12-month price target of (EURO)23. The broker thinks 
GDF's bid for the remainder of London-listed peer International Power has come earlier than expected, although the 
offer itself is hardly surprising. UBS reckons the offer price of 390p per share is likely to rise, and is assuming a final 
price of 420p, coupled with around (EURO)3bn in additional asset sales.
EASYJET Morgan Stanley has an "overweight" rating on the airline and has raised its target price from 510p to 
560p following an update from the firm. The broker has also lifted its full year pre-tax profit forecast by nine per cent 
to £260m, and expects to see EasyJet and Ryanair pick up market share as weaker competitors are hit by the 
soaring cost of fuel. Morgan Stanley has forecast five per cent passenger growth for EasyJet this year.
CRANSWICK Numis rates the pork products group "add" with a target price of 904p. The broker is happy with the 
firm's 12.9 per cent sales growth in the second half of the year, though notes the figures were flattered somewhat 
by a quiet comparative period. It has also pared back its margin forecasts for the coming year to 5.9 per cent, and 
expects to see the firm seek out acquisitions funded by its strong balance sheet.

EXORBITANT: that is the only way to describe the cripplingly high levels of Air Passenger Duty (APD) now facing 
everybody flying from the UK. The era of cheap flights which had done so much to make international travel 
accessible to the vast majority of the public is coming to a sorry end: the tax on flying to Australia is up by over 600 
per cent in just six years.
The APD rose another eight per cent yesterday, dealing a bitter blow to cash-strapped households and imposing 
yet further costs on businesses. It gets worse: the Treasury is planning to increase APD further over the next four 
years, which means that a family of four travelling to Australia could end up paying up to £500 in APD tax by 2016, 
a preposterous state of affairs and up from just £80 in 2005.
Taxing travel inevitably means taxing and reducing trade - and given that the UK's future lies with exporting more to 
Asia, Latin America and other long-haul destinations, the gov-ernment's strategy is perverse.
The aviation industry and tourism are two of Britain's few success stories outside of financial and business services; 
it is strange that the government wants to clobber what we are good at. Usually business leaders don't speak out 
enough on controversial matters, preferring instead to resort to dubious private lobbying. So it was good to see 
EasyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall, Ryanair boss Michael O''Leary and Virgin Atlantic CEO Steve Ridgway join 
Willie Walsh, boss of British Airways' owner IAG, in slamming the latest rise yesterday. Often, when people of the 
same trade unite, they do so to conspire against the public interest; in this case, companies and consumers are at 
one.
Remember which decisions in the Budget triggered all the anger, and drove a collapse in the government's overall 
opinion polls, as well as its perceived economic competence. Both were tax hikes, or perceived tax increases: the 
UK's over-taxed public is running out of patience
so-called Granny Tax, and the Pasty Tax. The lesson for our political class in general and the Tory party in 
particular should be clear: the public may not especially like spending cuts but it really hates paying more tax.
That is why council tax always triggers such passion - it is paid by almost everybody, and is a very visible tax that 
people actually have to write a cheque for. Of course, we are a horribly envious nation - and the majority want those 
wealthier than they are to pay more in tax. But most of the anger at the Budget came from the tax hikes on ordinary 
folk - and the shambles that has been the government's handling of the proposed tanker drivers' strike has 
reminded many voters of just how much tax they pay on every litre of petrol.
It is tragic that the government doesn't get this. The public is deeply divided on spending cuts - but it is almost 
united in its dislike of mass market taxes that affect the bulk of the public. This is not just true of Britain: in Ireland, a 
new property tax is facing mass resistance - and could derail the government's plans. Almost half of Irish 
households have refused to pay a new (EURO)100 poll tax - a precursor of this new wealth levy - on time. A full-
scale tax revolt is looming on the other side of the Irish sea.
The problem is that governments spend too much, not that they tax too little. Electorates are at the limit of what they 
are willing to pay. George Osborne must urgently do more to show taxpayers he is on their side.

THE field of bidders for Edinburgh Airport has narrowed to a straight fight between a group of investors led by JP 
Morgan and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).
Their private equity rivals for the asset, 3i and Carlyle, are said to have pulled out of what is expected to be a 
£500m race for the Scottish transport hub.
BAA, which also owns Heathrow, is being made to sell the airport by the Competition Commission, and is currently 
in a dispute over whether it will also have to give up Stansted airport.
GIP benefitted from the previous mandate from competition authorities that BAA, which is controlled by Spanish 
company Ferrovial, sell Gatwick.
If GIP snaps up Edinburgh Airport, however, regulators could decide to prevent any further acquisitions by the firm.
BAA is set to make a decision in the coming weeks over its preferred bidder, meaning it will offload the airport 
before any conclusion is reached on the possibility of Scottish independence But there are fears that high air 
passenger duty imposed from Westminster will slash volumes. A BAA-commissioned report has claimed that the 
rising tax could cut passenger numbers by 1.2m. Currently, over 9m travellers pass through Edinburgh Airport each 
year on 40 airlines - although Ryanair recently snubbed the airport, reducing its flights there.

Ryanair today accused EU Commission spokesman Antonio Gravili of "lying" when he told the press yesterday that 
there is no direction to ban EU officials to use Ryanair.
Ryanair accused Mr Gravili of denying a claim which Ryanair hadn't made.
At yesterday's press conference in Brussels, Ryanair quoted from the EU Commission and its travel agent (AMEX) 
correspondence which confirmed:
"'The European Commission does not allow us to book low cost flights, so we can only arrange the transfers from/to 
Brussels (Zaventem) Airport'." Ryanair also released a letter from the EU Commission (Director for Administration 
and Payment) which the airline said stated "It is true that the terms of this contract do prevent Amex from booking 
tickets with 'low-cost' airlines". Ryanair called on Mr Gravili to apologise for "his false claim yesterday and also 
called on him to explain what the EU Commission is doing to encourage its officials to save taxpayers money by 
actively flying with low fares airlines instead of high fare flag carriers". Ryanair also called on Mr Gravili, to release 
full details of the Commission's purchases of flight tickets last year, noting Mr Gravili's statement that "300 flights 
were booked last year at Ryanair, a total of 1,696 flights purchased in low cost airlines". "It is time that the 
Commission stopped lying about its - admitted - ban on flying low cost airlines. This ban has been confirmed by the 
Commission and its travel agent (AMEX) in writing, in what is yet another discrimination against Europe's low fares 
airlines. At a time when the EU Commission is preaching austerity on European States and on Europe's citizens, all 
EU officials should now switch to low fares airlines to save both money and time for Europe's taxpayers because 
Europe's low fare airlines suffer fewer delays and fewer cancellations than Europe's high fare carriers," said 
Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary.

PASSENGERS using Stansted airport may face travel chaos over the Easter period after baggage handlers voted 
to press ahead with strike action next weekend.
Around 150 employees of Swissport - who provide luggage services to airlines including Ryanair, Monarch and 
Thomas Cook - are set to strike for four hours on Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday in a move that 
could affect holidaymakers hoping to get away over the bank holiday weekend.
Despite this Swissport said the airport will be open as normal and travellers should not change their plans.
Workers are in a dispute over new shift patterns that they claim could reduce earnings by around £1,000 per year.
Gary Pearce of the GMB union, said: "Up to now the company has been intent on imposing these changes without 
agreement and this is completely unacceptable as the vote shows."
Ryanair said that it would maintain a full service but may restrict passengers to hand luggage if necessary.

Ryanair has criticized the European Union for allegedly discriminating against low-fare airlines and favoring national 
flag carriers.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the Ireland-based no-frills carrier, said Thursday that the EU ignores subsidies 
to state-owned airlines, which are banned under the bloc's free competition rules.
O'Leary also claimed that the EU bans its officials from using budget airlines such as Ryanair or EasyJet.
The bloc's executive commission denied both claims. It said its officials use low-cost airlines regularly.

Body
(ANSA) - March 28 - As regards the decision on sale of assets, in its judgment the Court stated that the 
Commission was competent to adopt a decision to approve, having come to believe that the sale was at market 
value. Thus the court rejected Ryanair's arguments, according to which the Commission had carried out an 
insufficient or incomplete examination at the stage of preliminary examination and should have opened a formal 
investigation procedure regarding the sale of assets in order to verify whether there were other options than that 
sale. The Court also rejected the argument from Ryanair that the sale, having been implicitly subject to the 
condition of nationality (Italian) of the purchaser, had led to a decrease in price. It considered, on the contrary, that 
the Commission had verified that the call for expressions of interest did not contain any discriminatory condition 
based on the nationality of the bidders and that the invitation had been the subject of wide publicity both nationally 
and internationally. Finally, the Court confirmed that the Commission correctly found that there was no economic 
continuity between Alitalia and CAI and that it did not receive any benefit, since they all measures were taken to 
ensure that the transfer did not happen at below market price.
Regarding the outcome of the decision on the loan, the Court believed that Ryanair, despite having played an active 
role in the adoption of this decision, has not demonstrated that the fact of ordering the recovery of the aid from 
Alitalia (and not at CAI) had damaged its its competitive position. It follows - the Court concluded - that Ryanair has 
not proven that it has been individually affected by that decision. Accordingly, the Court dismissed Ryanair's appeal, 
thereby confirming the decisions of the Commission.

Ryanair scrutinised over exit-row fees
Irish investigators are examining whether budget carrier Ryanair's scheme to charge passengers to reserve 
emergency exit seats contravenes the country's safety regulations.
Under the scheme, Ryanair allows passengers to reserve the more spacious seats - including those in the two 
overwing exit rows - for a E10 ($13) fee. The Irish Aviation Authority wants to ascertain whether this scheme results 
in exit rows being left vacant. In a policy document on self-help emergency exits, dated 31 January, the authority 
states that seats immediately adjacent to such exits should be occupied during taxi, take-off and landing.
"This will ensure a speedy and efficient response should a situation arise which warrants an emergency 
evacuation," it says.
Ryanair operates a fleet of Boeing 737-800s which are configured with 189 seats and have four emergency exits 
located in seat rows 16 and 17. The airline has not indicated whether, in the event of exit-row seats not being 
reserved, it reassigns passengers to occupy the vacant places.
"Ryanair complies with all mandatory safety directives," the carrier insists. EasyJet is to trial allocated seating but 
says it will work on a "different principle" and "will not have this isssue".

Trial part of focus on cost per seat
Mild winter helps airline trim losses
Body
Seats in the exit rows of some EasyJet flights will cost £12 from April as the no-frills airline seeks to attract 
customers reluctant to take part in the boarding-time mélee of budget flying.
Under EasyJet's first experiment with allocated seating - on routes between Luton and six destinations including 
Malaga, Istanbul and Glasgow - passengers will be assigned a spot, with an algorithm used to sit people booking 
together next to one another.
Passengers willing to pay £3 can choose their seats, although exit row and front row seats - with extra legroom - will 
cost an additional £9, and those towards the front an extra £5.
EasyJet is hopeful the feature will attract business travellers who tend to book later, buy flexible fares and worry 
less about price.
Risks include longer aircraft turnround times and a fall in passengers paying for speedy boarding, which gives 
access to preferred seats. Speedy boarding, at £9-£16 a flight, raised tens of millions of pounds for the airline last 
year.
EasyJet's bigger rival, Ryanair, already lets passengers reserve some seats for a charge.
Carolyn McCall, EasyJet chief executive, said the summer-long trial had cost about £5m, mainly in IT upgrades, 
and would be "revenue-neutral at worst".
Details of the trial came as the company said it would beat its own expectations for the first half of its financial year, 
shortening losses by £30m-£40m, after a mild winter.
EasyJet offers exit-row seats for £12
In recent years Europe's airlines have been hurt by severe weather, industrial action by air traffic controllers, and 
the eruption of a volcano in Iceland.
EasyJet said it expected to report a pre-tax loss of £110m-£120m for the six months to March 31, against previous 
guidance of a loss of £140m-£160m. The shares rose 7 per cent, or 32.6p, to 494p.
The airline was hit by a £100m increase in its first-half fuel bill, which it said would widen to £145m in the second 
half. Costs per seat excluding fuel have risen only 1.5 per cent from the same period last year, compared with the 3 
per cent expected increase.
In 2011 EasyJet reported an interim pre-tax loss of £153m from revenues of £1.3bn, but swung to a pre-tax profit of 
£248m for the full year to September 30.
EasyJet said its costs per seat for the full year would rise 2 per cent from last year's £51.30, "assuming no 
significant disruption arising from events such as airspace congestion during the Olympics".
That caveat echoes a letter sent by EasyJet and other UK airlines this month to the Civil Aviation Authority. They 
said the system was not prepared for freak events, such as a bad thunderstorm during the London Olympics, and 
called on the CAA to give air traffic controllers greater flexibility.

Highlight: The main Dublin shares index rose today after last week's sharp falls after a surprise boost in Germany's 
business and investor mood.
Body
The main Dublin shares index rose today after last week's sharp falls after a surprise boost in Germany's business 
and investor mood.
The index rose 10.93 points to 3,275.44.
German business sentiment rose unexpectedly for the fifth month in a row in March, signalling that Europe's largest 
economy is proving more resilient than others to the euro zone debt crisis. The Munich-based Ifo think tank said on 
Monday its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 companies, rose to 109.8 in March 
from a revised 109.7 in February. The closely watched Ifo index bucked expectations for a steady reading and rose 
to its highest level since July 2011, just days after data showed the first contraction in German manufacturing this 
year. "German Ifo: is the sky the limit?" said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING in Brussels. "The strong labour 
market, filled order books and low inventories still bode well for growth in the coming months, albeit at a low level."
The pace of the collapse in national home prices picked up again in February with prices down 17.8pc in the year 
compared to 17.4pc in January and 16.7pc in December, latest figures from the CSO reveal. Shares in Kingspan 
fell 3c to E7.95. Shares in Irish-Swiss bakery products group, Aryzta climbed 11c to E36.60. A Swiss federal court 
has dismissed an appeal by Lehner and Partner against a ruling by the commercial court of the canton of Zurich 
about the validity and fairness of the share exchange ratio applied in the IAWS/Hiestand transaction that created 
Aryzta. The proceedings are now concluded. "The nuisance of the original legal claim and subsequent appeal has 
been brought to an end by the federal court ruling," said Davy Research. EasyJet (EZJ) has released an 
unexpected first half trading update. It is guiding a first half pre-tax loss of £110-120m from £140-160m previously, 
so an average £35m better, but a slightly higher fuel charge than previously guided and foreign exchange will see 
H2 guidance unchanged. This translates into a net upgrade equivalent to around 14pc for the full year for 
consensus. Shares in Ryanair jumped 11c to E4.43. With five days to go until the current extension for the US 
ISEQ edges up on German hopes ISEQ Up
highways programme expires, the one certainty is that we are not going to get a multi-year highways programme. 
So the attention this week turns to the shape of the ninth short-term extension. Various news releases suggest that 
it will be for three months. However, given Congress's current rhetoric around highway funding, some are 
speculating whether we could face the same situation as the Federal Aviation Administration last July, where failure 
to agree funding levels led to a shutdown of the programme for two-weeks. Shares in CRH, for whom the US 
highways business is vital, rose 6c to E15.79.

Ryanair has accused the European Commission of telling lies when it said that EU staff are not prohibited from 
booking tickets on low fare airlines.
"These reported denials are contradicted by written confirmations from the EU Commission itself and the EU's 
travel manager (AMEX) that its contract: "prevents AMEX from booking tickets with low cost airlines", according to 
Ryanair.
In what the Irish airline called "the EU Commission's blatant discrimination against low fare airlines in general, and 
Ryanair in particular", the EU Commission has also refused to arrange transfers to/from Brussels Charleroi Airport, 
but confirms these to Brussels Zaventem Airport only, Ryanair said.
"These false denials by unnamed commission spokesmen are flatly contradicted by written confirmations issued to 
Ryanair by the EU Commission and its travel agency AMEX. At a time when the EU Commission is preaching 
austerity, perhaps it should lead by example and prohibit booking tickets on high fare, fuel surcharging flag carriers 
and require instead that its fat cat bureaucrats save time and EU taxpayers' money by travelling with low fares 
airlines including Ryanair, easyJet and others, which are readily available to the EU Commission and its travel 
agency at the click of a mouse," said Ryanair's Stephen McNamara. "Ryanair will be holding a press conference in 
Brussels next Thursday to expose these latest lies by the European Commission which continues to discriminate 
against low fares airlines in general and Ryanair in particular."

Ryanair has accused the European Commission of telling lies when it said that EU staff are not prohibited from 
booking tickets on low fare airlines.
"These reported denials are contradicted by written confirmations from the EU Commission itself and the EU's

Ryanair.
In what the Irish airline called "the EU Commission's blatant discrimination against low fare airlines in general, and 
Ryanair in particular", the EU Commission has also refused to arrange transfers to/from Brussels Charleroi Airport, 
but confirms these to Brussels Zaventem Airport only, Ryanair said.

The main Dublin shares index managed to edge in to positive territory again today but gains were small as 
nervousness increased over sovereign debt problems in Italy and Spain.
The index rose 1.75 points to 3,264.51.
Growth is an essential component of plans by struggling euro zone countries to reduce high debt levels and with 
economies slowing, planned bond sales by Italy next week could refocus investor attention on the bloc's debt crisis. 
The MSCI world equity index was slightly down on the day, having hit its highest level in nearly eight months earlier 
this week. The rally has stalled on the back of weak factory activity data in China and the euro zone, which has 
somewhat undermined faith in the pace of a global upturn.

states that McDonald's is to trial a range of sweet baked goods in its New England restaurant estate. Depending on 
the outcome, all day available baked goods may become part of McDonald's menu offering. The range of sweet 
baked goods will include various flavours of scones, cheese Danish and muffins. The products will be baked in-
store. The owner of 13 McDonald's restaurants in Massachusetts and Rhode Island is quoted as stating that "the 
fact that we bake them on the premises is a unique piece. We actually bake them. They are not frozen". All this is

Ryanair's fight against laws obliging it to feed and lodge airline customers stranded by events such as the 2010 
volcanic ash cloud has been dealt a blow by the European Court of Justice.
Yves Bot, the court's advocate-general, published an opinion on Wednesday stating that airlines were not exempt 
from regulations requiring them to pay for stranded passengers' hotels, meals and drinks even if flight cancellations 
were because of circumstances beyond their control.
Mr Bot said Ryanair should have paid the room and board for Denise McDonagh, whose flight from Faro to Dublin 
two years ago was cancelled following Eyjafjallajökull volcano's eruptions, stranding her in Portugal for a week.
The ECJ has yet to issue a ruling in the case but often decides along the lines of opinions from the advocate-
general. The ruling will have little impact on Ryanair's finances, given other cases related to the volcanic-ash 
disruption have been settled. But the precedent could weaken airlines' future arguments for exemption from their 
obligations.
However, Siim Kallas, Europe's transport commissioner, has launched a review of passenger rights laws passed in 
2005, and is expected to propose legislation that reduces airlines' responsibility to care for stranded passengers .
Commission officials said they stood behind the bloc's passenger rights laws, but have also accepted the airline 
industry's argument that carriers should not be required to assume those responsibilities for extended stretches   
because of events beyond their control.
Mr Bot disagreed, arguing that "the provision of care is particularly important in the case of extraordinary 
circumstances which persist over a long time", and pointed out that airlines can pass on the cost of these 
obligations to customers, through higher fares.
Ryanair dealt a blow in fight over care for stranded passengers
Ryanair argued that in Ms McDonagh's case it should only be responsible for three nights of accommodation, with a 
price cap of EUR80 a night and similar limits on food and drink should be imposed.
The low-cost airline on Wednesday emphasised the non-binding nature of Mr Bot's opinion. "We hope the final 
court decision will find in favour of Ryanair's appeal and remove the blatant discrimination in the EU261 airline 
regulations," the group said, referring to varying standards for companies running different types of transport, such 
as ferry and coach.

Airlines have been told that one of their preferred measures for minimising delays and disruption at London's 
airports during the Olympic Games cannot be implemented.
The Civil Aviation Authority told British Airways and other airlines at a meeting yesterday that their call for their 
scheduled flights to be given priority over business jets and smaller aircraft would be difficult to execute and legally 
questionable.
The airlines warned last week of a potential capacity crunch in the airspace above south-east England following bad 
weather or security incidents during the games, and said scheduled flights should be given priority in such 
circumstances by controllers.
But the CAA told the meeting yesterday that controllers at National Air Traffic Services were not meant to 
discriminate between aircraft under the body's operating licence.
Officials at the chief aviation regulator also expressed doubts about the practicality of prioritising particular aircraft.
The CAA said the meeting had discussed various measures. "The meeting accepted some of those proposals were 
not legal and that others were not feasible for practical reasons." The airlines agreed to look at other measures.
In December, airlines warned that some people could miss events because of what they saw as inadequate plans 
at Heathrow to cope with bad weather or security incidents.

You are not a real country unless you have a beer and an airline, Frank Zappa once observed. In 1993, the year of 
his death, there was much truth to the rock musician's aphorism. Twenty years later, there isn't - at least as regards 
Europe and its airlines. One by one, Europe's medium-sized and small nations are discovering that independence 
can survive the disappearance of an independent national airline. Several former flag carriers, such as Austrian 
Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Swiss, are under full or partial foreign control. Others, such as the Czech Republic's 
CSA, Lot of Poland and Portugal's TAP, are going along the same flight path. Two have gone bust this year: 
Hungary's Malev and, to stretch the definition of a national airline, Spanair of Catalonia . The rest are turning into 
zombies, which stronger rivals cannot be bothered either to absorb or to kill off.
Europe still has too many airlines, but the contours of a consolidated sector are emerging. It is reasonable to expect 
that the five dominant operators of the future will be Germany's Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, International Airlines 
Group (consisting of the old British Airways and Spain's Iberia), Ryanair and EasyJet.
The latter two low-fare airlines are famously nimble, cost-conscious and quick-thinking. No sooner did Malev bite 
the dust last month than Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, announced that his aircraft would replace most 
of the traffic and routes lost at Budapest airport. EasyJet knows its onions too: its 12.7 per cent return on capital 
employed last year was an impressive achievement.
What of Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG? Thanks to their state-controlled legacy, these are often considered 
lumbering beasts, scarred by recurring outbreaks of labour unrest. How well placed are they to deliver profits and 
compete with the fast-growing airlines of the Gulf, China and south-east Asia?
In the short term there is no question that conditions will be difficult. According to the International Air Transport 
Association , which represents the world's airlines, the industry as a whole will eke out a $3.5bn profit this year but 
European carriers will lose $600m. Rising fuel prices and Europe's bleak macroeconomic outlook will bite into their 
profits.
Europe's airline brew will be more potent with less froth
That said, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG are striving to adapt to the harsh climate. Arguably, their most 
frustrating problem is Europe's clumsy strategic approach to the development of air transport. Take Lufthansa's 
cargo business. This division is one of the company's most precious assets. It chalked up EUR249m in operating 
profit last year, the unit's second-best annual result. Without the contribution of Lufthansa Cargo, the group's net 
loss would have exceeded EUR13m and - who knows? - shareholders might not have received a dividend.
Almost certainly, Lufthansa Cargo will this year record a lower profit. One reason is that a German court imposed a 
ban last October on night flights over Lufthansa's Frankfurt hub. Whether or not this ruling satisfied people who live 
near the airport, it seemed a peculiar decision: Frankfurt airport had just opened a fourth runway, partly with a view 
to helping Lufthansa. If a higher court backs the ruling next month, Lufthansa Cargo estimates it will lose EUR40m 
in annual earnings.
Similar policymaking confusion hinders the expansion of airport capacity in other parts of Europe. One glaring 
example is the UK, whose coalition government has ruled out a third runway at London Heathrow - Europe's 
busiest hub - but seems in two minds about whether to follow the alternative route of building an   airport in the 
Thames estuary .
This indecision exasperates Willie Walsh , IAG chief executive. A EUR485m operating profit last year demonstrated 
his ability to maximise returns from the North Atlantic routes that are his group's main strength. A takeover of TAP , 
which Portugal's debt-stricken government is putting up for sale, would add useful South Atlantic routes. The 
proposed acquisition of BMI would strengthen its UK position. But bolt-on acquisitions such as these are less 
important than the modern London hub that IAG needs to flourish.
Most embarrassing of all is the failure of Europe's governments to make progress on creating a so-called "single 
European sky" for air traffic management. At present no fewer than 38 national air navigation services manage 
Europe's airspace.
The European Union deserves praise for having liberalised the aviation market in the 1990s. But the ensuing 54 per 
cent increase in air traffic makes it inexcusable that governments lack the political will to unify Europe's airspace or 
to build more capacity in its airports. If Europe wants an airline industry that thrives as well as consolidates, this is 
the place to start.

BUDGET airline Ryanair yesterday lost the latest round in its legal battle to avoid paying for hotels, meals and 
drinks for passengers disrupted by delayed flights during the Icelandic volcano eruption in 2010.
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) published an opinion indicating that airlines were not exempt from regulations 
requiring them to pay for stranded passengers' extra-care expenses, such as hotels and meals, even if the flight 
cancellations were due to circumstances beyond the airline's control.
"It does not appear to be disproportionate to impose on air carriers such an obligation to provide care in so far as 
they are free to pass on the resulting costs to airline ticket prices," the advocate general, Yves Bot, said in a 
decision published on the court's website.
The decision comes after a Dublin woman, Denise MacDonagh, took Ryanair to the ECJ for its failure to refund her 
expenses when her flight was held up by nine days due to the volcanic ash cloud in 2010.
Last night Ryanair issued a statement saying it noted that the advocate general's opinion is not binding on the ECJ, 
hoping that the court will side with the airline in its final decision.

The Eyjafjallajökull ash cloud grounded thousands of flights (Ingolfur Juliusson / Reuters)
Ryanair could face substantial payouts after being found to have failed to care for passengers stranded by the 
Icelandic volcanic eruption.
Yves Bot, advocate general at the European Court of Justice, ruled that the budget airline was remiss in its 
customer care responsibilities following the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in 2010.
The ruling followed a claim by passenger Denise McDonagh, who was unable to fly to Dublin from Faro, on April 17 
due to the ash cloud grounding flights.
She made a claim for (EURO)1,130 (£942) in damages to cover her accommodation, food and transport costs.
Ryanair claimed the disruption caused by the ash cloud was a disaster beyond the boundaries of EU regulations, 
which call for airlines to cover the cost of care during events classed as "extraordinary circumstances".
The district court in Dublin referred the case to court of justice, which ruled that the disruption was not outside the 
bounds of extraordinary circumstances.
"The provision of care is particularly important in the case of extraordinary circumstances which persist over a long 
time," the advocate general said.
"It is precisely institutions where the waiting period occasioned by the cancellation of a flight is particularly lengthy 
that it is necessary to ensure that an air passenger, whose flight has been cancelled, can have access to essential 
goods and services throughout that period.
"A limitation of the obligation to provide care would in some measure deprive the EU legislation of its effectiveness, 
since after a few days the air passengers concerned would be abandoned to their fate."
He added that it would not be disproportionate to impose an obligation on airlines to cover these costs as they are 
free to pass those costs on through price hikes.
Ryanair Face Big Bill Over Stranded Icelandic Volcano Passengers
"What is more, that is a policy which has already been put into effect by Ryanair, which introduced a special levy in 
April 2011 in order to cover the costs which it had incurred in providing care to passengers whose flights had been 
cancelled owing to the eruption of the Icelandic volcano."
The advocate general's findings must be confirmed by court, which tends to follow suit in the majority of cases.

THE CHANCELLOR yesterday signalled his support for more airports or runways in the south east of England - but 
airlines were left fuming after he again ignored their calls to halt a hike in air passenger duty.
George Osborne said the government must "confront" the problem of air capacity, though he shied away from 
backing either a controversial third runway at Heathrow or the Thames Estuary airport plan.
And the chancellor made no mention of altering the air passenger duty, sparking harsh words from a group of 
airlines.
"Yet again, the Treasury is pressing ahead with further rises without any analysis of their effect on the wider 
economy," said the chief executives of EasyJet, IAG, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic in a joint statement yesterday.
"In the absence of such a study, we must assume that the Treasury knows it cannot justify this jobdestroying tax in 
overall economic terms. APD must be scrapped."
The quartet have long urged the coalition to drop the tax on plane passengers, which is due to rise by twice the rate 
of inflation, or around eight per cent, in April following a freeze in 2011. The duty will cost passengers up to £92 per 
flight.
The levy is expected to raise £2.7bn this financial year, rising to £3.9bn in 2016, the Treasury has forecast. The CBI 
said Osborne "has missed an opportunity to reinforce that the UK is open for business."

An EU court has ruled that Ryanair must pay a passenger whose flight was cancelled after the 2010 volcanic 
eruption in Iceland shut down European air traffic.
"The air carrier must provide care to passengers whose flights have been canceled because of extraordinary 
circumstances such as the closure of airspace following the eruption," the EU's Court of Justice in Luxembourg said 
in a statement.
An eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in April 2010 caused airlines to cancel more than 100,000 flights on 
concern glass-like particles spewed into the atmosphere might clog aircraft engines. The shutdown of airspace cost 
carriers at least dollar 1.7 billion, while European transport ministers took five days to agree airports could open with 
the dust still in the air.
The EU court is advising an Irish tribunal on a claim by Denise McDonagh for about 1,130 euros in damages that 
she sought from Ryanair to pay for meals, accommodation and transport when her flight was cancelled.

EU To Probe State Aid Rule Violation In Belgian, French , German Airline Sector
EU To Probe State Aid Rule Violation In Belgian, French, German Airline

Body
(RTTNews) - The European Commission has launched an investigation into financial arrangements between public 
authorities and the airports of Charleroi in Belgium, Angoulême in France and Dortmund in Germany to see if they 
infringed EU state aid rules.
The opening of proceedings will also cover rebates and marketing agreements concluded between these airports 
and some of the airlines using them, the Commission said on Wednesday.
The Commission has extended the scope of an investigation opened in December 2002 into advantages granted to 
the low-cost airline Ryanair when it set up operations at Charleroi airport and opened two new distinct in-depth 
investigations into the financing of the Angoulême and Dortmund airports.
Investments by public authorities into companies carrying out economic activities are in line with EU state aid rules 
when they are made on terms that a private player operating under market conditions would accept the market 
economy investor principle, MEIP.
The Commission said that on the basis of the information available, it cannot exclude that the measures in favor of 
the three airports and their customer airlines involves state aid which give them an undue advantage vis-à-vis their 
competitors and is thus incompatible with the internal market.
Charleroi (CRL) is a Belgian regional airport located in the Walloon Region. In 2004, the Commission cleared part 
of the public support in favor of Ryanair but required the company to reimburse the state aid incompatible with EU 
rules. In 2008, the EU General Court concluded that the Commission had not applied the MEIP correctly and 
annulled this decision. The Commission has now reopened the case in order to take this judgment into account.
At the same time, the Commission has extended the scope of its investigation to possible state aid that was not 
covered by its original probe. This will enable the Commission to assess the situation in Charleroi on an equal 
footing with that in other airports currently investigated by the Commission.
Angoulême (ANG) is a French local airport in Charente. Between 2002 and 2012, it received several infrastructure 
subsidies, as well as public support to finance its operations. The Commission has doubts if the MEIP has been 
respected and that the airport could operate under market conditions. Moreover, the Commission has concerns that

contractual rebates and marketing arrangements concluded between the airport and Ryanair in 2008 could have 
procured the latter an undue economic advantage over its competitors.
Dortmund (DTM) is a German regional airport in North Rhine-Westphalia. In 2007, the Commission had opened an 
in-depth investigation into the public financing of the airport as well as the scheme of charges applied to the airlines. 
The Commission has now opened a second investigation regarding public guarantees granted in favor of the airport 
as well as a new scheme of charges, called NEO, put in place in 2009. The Commission said it had concerns that 
the system of airport charges operated at Dortmund could procure the airlines using the airport an undue economic 
advantage which their competitors do not have.

The main Dublin shares index today rose steadily to within reach of the 3,300 level, lifted by upbeat comments from 
the U.S. Federal Reserve and a successful auction of Italian bonds.
The ISEQ gained 12.52 points to 3,279.93.
Stocks rallied after the Fed improved its outlook for the United States, the world's largest economy and Europe's 
biggest export market, and said most U.S. banks had passed stress tests. Italy, Europe's largest debtor, sold 6 
billion euros of bonds at a debt auction today, with yields at their lowest since October 2010, suggesting investors

Alan Miller really set the cat among the pigeons when he launched his fund fee transparency campaign at the end 
of January.
The former Wealth Manager cover star and co-founder of SCM Private claimed there were £18 billion of hidden 
charges in the industry.
Miller's campaign has polarised the investment community.
This documentary grills Miller, along with the Investment Management Association and Fidelity, which had warned 
of 'Ryanair' pricing in the industry. The boss of the former, Richard Saunders, launches a fierce defence of his 
members.
We also ask MP Mark Garnier about how big this problem is.

Ronan Byrne has been marketing director of Kenbay Electric Bikes since 2006.
Situated in Tallaght in South Dublin, the company sells through a network of dealers around the country. It launched 
an Electric Commuter Challenge late last year to encourage people to cycle to work by offering free trials of electric 
bikes.
.....
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
I keep in contact with our dealers around the country making sure everything is okay and also keep an eye on the 
customer service to address any issues or problems, which are few, thankfully. Along with this, I am responsible for 
promotional activity; organising promotional literature, attending exhibitions or editing content on our website.
**What are your professional motivators?**
To provide the Irish market with a real alternative to public transport, dirty cars and battling up hills on bicycles. 
These forms of transport have their advantages, but they don't suit everyone. We provide motorised transport that 
does not require a licence and is very cost-effective to run. We hope this can contribute to reduce commuting times 
and carbon emissions, provide freedom and independence for older people and contribute to more active and 
healthy lifestyle,
**How would you describe your work style?**
I am dedicated. I do whatever needs to be done. If a weekend needs to be given up to promote our products or 
solve an unexpected problem, I generally put work first. This isn't always the case, however. I definitely appreciate 
the value of taking a break so my time off is very important to me and I try to use it the best I can. I also try to have 
Working Week
a comprehensive knowledge of every aspect of the company. I don't micro-manage, but I always keep track of 
feedback from every aspect of the business.
**What rates as your best business decision?**
It was our decision at Kenbay to change one of our main suppliers. In the past, we had been let down and we had 
to decide whether or not we would stick with them despite their promises to improve service. We opted to go with a 
different supplier and, as a result, the reliability of our product improved greatly. Our latest range of bikes have been 
on the market for six months now with no issues.
**What is the most valuable professional lesson that you have learned?**
Making sure you are make the right choices to promote your business. Some of our initial activities were a bit hit-
and-miss, so making sure you are getting your message out to the right people in the right way is essential.
**Who do you most admire in Irish business?**
This may not be a popular choice, but Michael O'Leary is someone I admire. What he has done with Ryanair has 
completely changed the face of Irish aviation. A lot of people complain, but they forget that Aer Lingus had a 
complete monopoly of Irish air routes and they were charging monopoly prices.
**What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?**
I see more and more electric bikes on the roads. The price of fuel is only ever going to go one way and that is up. 
The early adopters have already recognised that electric bikes are a good way of getting around. These days, a 
year of using Dublin bus services would more or less pay for one of our bikes.
**What is your ultimate professional goal?**
To make Kenbay the number one electric bicycle brand in Ireland and to use that as a platform to expand across 
Europe and the rest of the world. I hope we can provide employment to Irish people to contribute to fixing the 
economy, but our big challenge is taking on the global brands already in the marketplace. With support from Irish 
consumers, we think we can achieve this.

Highlight: The European Commission, one of three institutions overseeing the belt-tightening in Greece, has 
barred its travel agency from booking flights on low-cost carriers
Body
The European Commission, one of three institutions overseeing the belt-tightening in Greece, has barred its travel 
agency from booking flights on low-cost carriers, which offer rock-bottom fares but few comforts.
These airlines also tend to use secondary or relatively remote airports, which is how Michael O'Leary, the famously 
brash chief executive of Ryanair, the biggest budget carrier in Europe, found out about it.
Invited by the commission to be a guest speaker at a conference on innovation late last year, Mr. O'Leary was told 
that travel expenses, including a driver from the main Brussels airport, were included.
But when he asked to use his own airline - which flies into the rather optimistically named Brussels South Charleroi 
Airport, about 70 kilometers, or 44 miles, from Brussels - he was told such bookings were impossible. Nor would a 
driver be sent to pick him up. Instead, Mr. O'Leary was offered a ticket to the main airport on Aer Lingus - the 
former Irish flag carrier that the commission blocked him from buying in an acrimonious case five years ago 
according to the New York Times today. This week, lawyers for Ryanair filed a formal complaint with the European 
Court of Auditors, an independent body that reviews the commission's spending, asking it to assess "the legality, 
regularity and financial soundness" of the travel policy. The lawyers also wrote to the commission's most senior civil 
servant, Secretary General Catherine Day, demanding that she drop the restrictions on the travel agency, American 
Express Business Travel, according to documents. The European Commission has defended its policy as 
necessary to ensure flexibility for traveling officials whose plans can change at the last minute. In fact, many 
companies and governments operate in a similar fashion. Even in Greece, while the government does not bar its 
travel agents from booking low-cost carriers, it does not actively encourage their use, and ministers generally travel 
business class, according to government officials. The Court of Auditors, which monitors the European Union's 
finances, declined to comment on Wednesday about the complaint. The latest accusations of wastefulness are far 
from the first to be leveled against European institutions and officials. Last year, Jose Manuel Barroso, president of 
Ryanair complains to EU on bookings Ryanair
the commission, and Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, which represents national 
governments, aroused ire by taking separate private jets to a meeting in Russia. And the entire European 
Parliament, more than 750 deputies and their staff, makes a costly trek from Brussels once a month to a second 
meeting in Strasbourg, France, drawing recurrent criticism even from members themselves. By attacking the travel 
policy, Mr. O'Leary is seeking to turn the tables on competition officials who have been investigating Ryanair for 
much of the last decade. In 2007, the commission blocked Ryanair's planned takeover of Aer Lingus on the 
grounds that the combined airline would have had a monopoly on too many routes. Mr. O'Leary accused the 
commission of bowing to political pressure from the Irish government, which had opposed the deal. The bailed-out 
Irish government is now looking to sell its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus to raise cash, and Ryanair has recently 
confirmed that it would discuss selling its 30 percent share with any buyer.

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L), a 29.8% shareholder in Aer Lingus, instructed its lawyers to 
postpone any further legal action against Aer Lingus plc, to prevent Aer Lingus (AERL.L) making any top up 
contributions to its defined contribution pension schemes, following the unequivocal and public assurances made by 
Aer Lingus CEO Mr Christoph Mueller during the company's annual results last week. On behalf of Aer Lingus, 
Mueller has ruled out any pension fund top-up, and also confirmed that Aer Lingus' participation in recent Labour 
Relations Commission talks was "through a moral obligation to the employees, more than anything else".
Ryanair said it welcomes this definitive and unequivocal assurance by Aer Lingus to its shareholders and staff that 
it would not make any further contributions to its pension schemes over and above its existing fixed contribution 
rates, and believes that all Aer Lingus shareholders would take comfort from Mueller's unequivocal assurances.
Further, Ryanair has advised Aer Lingus that should the company or management attempt to resile from this 
unequivocal position concerning its defined contribution pension schemes, then Ryanair would restart its legal 
action against Aer Lingus in order to protect the interests of all Aer Lingus' shareholders and prevent these funds 
being wasted yet again by Aer Lingus on further contributions to Aer Lingus' DC pension schemes.

(RTTNews) - Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) called on the Office of Fair Trading, or OFT, to explain their decision this 
week not to ask the European Commission to refer the BA/British Midland merger back to the OFT for assessment, 
which runs contrary to the OFT's previous decision to attempt to review the European Commission's ruling on 
Ryanair's failed 2006 offer for Aer Lingus, which the OFT is attempting to investigate, despite the fact that it is out of 
time to do so.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said,
"The OFT now admits that the European Commission is "best placed" to consider these airline mergers, and as a 
result, the OFT has decided not to review BA's acquisition of British Midland. Given this admission, the OFT and its 
Irish boss John Fingleton should explain precisely why six years after Ryanair's failed takeover of an Irish airline, 
Aer Lingus, was prohibited by the European Commission, it now wishes to re-investigate the European 
Commission's decision not to force Ryanair to dispose of its 29% stake in Aer Lingus..."

An advertising watchdog has reprimanded Irish airline Ryanair over an ad campaign that suggested British travel 
company Thomas Cook was likely to collapse.
The London-based Advertising Standards Agency says in a judgment Wednesday that Ryanair's newspaper ads in 
the run-up to last Christmas misled viewers and denigrated Thomas Cook, which was struggling financially after a 
string of profit warnings.
The November ads led with the message "Bye Bye Thomas Cook," reprinted newspaper headlines on Thomas 
Cook's debt difficulties, and noted Ryanair was "guaranteed to keep flying this Christmas."
The Advertising Standards Agency says the ads implied that Thomas Cook was likely to collapse by Christmas.
Ryanair denied this was its intent. Thomas Cook didn't comment.

The problem
Last week Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, challenged UK ministers to have the 
"political balls" to review its opposition to building a third runway at London's Heathrow airport. Is it a 
good strategy to use such colourful language in public when trying to persuade policymakers? Or is it 
more pragmatic to adopt a more diplomatic tone?
The advice
The media adviser Tim Allan  Willie Walsh is doing exactly the right thing: putting the case on a critical issue for 
his business in clear, eye-catching terms.
Maybe it is something about the noise of aircraft, but the airline industry attracts chief executives who are not afraid 
of shouting their case from the rooftops. What Mr Walsh and Ryanair's Michael O'Leary do is recognise that 
communication with politicians cannot only be about submissions to consultation papers. Companies often need to 
back up their direct lobbying with a clear public-facing campaign. In short, they have to have the communication 
balls to make their case loud and clear in public and private. The writer is the founder of Portland and a former 
media adviser to Tony Blair
The academic Paul Argenti Those of us who teach and write about communication would advise anyone 
considering using profanity when trying to persuade a key constituency to act in your best interest: don't ever do it. 
It immediately turns people off the message, and switches their focus on to anger instead.
Your goal when communicating in business is to get your audience to do what you want. So, if Willie Walsh really 
wanted politicians to build a third runway at Heathrow, he should have looked at it from their perspective. All he did 
was get his rocks off - to use another colourful phrase - and while it might have felt good for a few moments, the 
outcome is not so good. The writer is a professor of corporate communications at the Tuck School of 
Business
Is it wise to use colourful language to lobby publicly?
The industry rep Bryan Green  In public debate, colourful language can deliver results only if people feel it is 
authentic to the speaker. Think Bob Geldof circa 1985 and Live Aid. A few choice words, screamed at the right 
people underscored a passionate belief and a call to action.
But there are few Geldofs.
When expletives explode in the course of cajoling organisations and policymakers, too often it signals the speaker's 
position is weakening. That invites those with opposing views to exploit that weakness and sidelines potential allies 
who focus on the behaviour rather than the argument.
Much more impactful are the firm but considered types. Lobbying requires quiet calculation; considered counsel and 
persistence. In short, think less Geldof and more Gandhi. The writer is president of the Turnaround 
Management Association (UK)

The ISEQ slumped by nearly 100 points today as fears of a recession in the eurozone and Greek default sent 
investors running for cover.
The index fell 93.67 points to 3,132.57.
European shares hit a one-week low as fresh concerns about growth in Europe and China prompted investors to 
cut their risk exposure. Equities extended losses during the session, with traders citing a rumour that Greek 
restructuring will not happen until next week accelerating the decline and with a weaker PSA Peugeot Citroen 
weighing on auto stocks. It is still not clear how much participation Athens will see for its bond swap and a failure to 
agree would put Greece back on the brink of a messy default. A Greek finance ministry official denied that there 
was any plan to extend the March 8 deadline for investors to participate in the bond swap.
Aer Lingus stocks fell 1c to E0.87 after it reported an 8pc rise in passenger numbers in February. Ryanair shares 
dipped 3c to E4.16. CRH stocks fell 83c to E15.30. The value of US highway construction put-in-place declined by 
2.2pc in January. Latest data show that the value of US highway construction put-in-place declined by 2.2pc 
compared to the same month last year. This is the 11th straight month of declines, continuing the negative trend set 
in 2011. Bank of Ireland's recent results highlighted the solid deleveraging progress made by the bank in 2011, 
according to Davy's Emer Lang. Deposits reached E70.5bn, while loan disposals/redemptions finished the year well

encouraging early signs of deposit re-pricing, there remain sufficient headwinds to keep a lid on the margin in 2012.

The ISEQ slumped by nearly 100 points today as fears of a recession in the eurozone and Greek default sent 
investors running for cover.
The index fell 93.67 points to 3,132.57.
European shares hit a one-week low as fresh concerns about growth in Europe and China prompted investors to 
cut their risk exposure. Equities extended losses during the session, with traders citing a rumour that Greek 
restructuring will not happen until next week accelerating the decline and with a weaker PSA Peugeot Citroen 
weighing on auto stocks. It is still not clear how much participation Athens will see for its bond swap and a failure to 
agree would put Greece back on the brink of a messy default. A Greek finance ministry official denied that there 
was any plan to extend the March 8 deadline for investors to participate in the bond swap.
Aer Lingus stocks fell 1c to E0.87 after it reported an 8pc rise in passenger numbers in February. Ryanair shares 
dipped 3c to E4.16. CRH stocks fell 83c to E15.30. The value of US highway construction put-in-place declined by 
2.2pc in January. Latest data show that the value of US highway construction put-in-place declined by 2.2pc 
compared to the same month last year. This is the 11th straight month of declines, continuing the negative trend set 
in 2011. Bank of Ireland's recent results highlighted the solid deleveraging progress made by the bank in 2011, 
according to Davy's Emer Lang. Deposits reached E70.5bn, while loan disposals/redemptions finished the year well 
on track. The resultant cash generation reduced wholesale funding by 27pc from E70bn to E51bn in the year. The 
LTD ratio ended the year at 144pc, down from 175pc, yet margin dynamics remain challenging. "Notwithstanding 
encouraging early signs of deposit re-pricing, there remain sufficient headwinds to keep a lid on the margin in 2012. 
The trend in impairment losses remains negative and planned personal voluntary debt arrangements add to the 
uncertainty, potentially exacerbating the negative impetus. Our revised estimates envisage a less favourable margin 
trajectory," she said. Shares in the bank fell 1c to E0.13. AIB dropped 1c to E0.11. Shares in fresh food group, Total

The ISEQ's rally of last week ran out of steam today despite good gains on Paddy Power stocks after its strong 
results but as profit takers dominated.
The index fell 39.57 points to 3,226.24.
World stocks fell and the euro traded near two-week lows after fresh economic data raised expectations of a 
recession in Europe, and China signalled it would accept a slower growth rate. Nervousness over whether Greece 
will complete a bond exchange with private creditors by March 8, to secure a 130 billion euro (dollar 172 billion) 
bailout deal and avoid a messy debt default, also undermined demand for riskier assets.
Paddy Power has reported a strong set of full year numbers. Reported EBIT grew 16pc (pre-exceptional items), 
coming in at E119.6m versus Davy's forecast of E115.2m, a beat of 3.7pc. Diluted adjusted EPS came in 5.3pc 
ahead of the broker's forecast at 212.3c (Davy: 201.7c), helped by slightly higher interest income and a slightly 
lower tax charge than expected. The group has announced a 33pc increase in the full year dividend to 100c per 
share. Shares in the bookie rose 58c to E45.53. FBD's 2011 results have comfortably beaten expectations. 
Highlights include operating profit before tax of E64.9m, which compares with our E61.6m forecast, and reported 
operating EPS of 170c, up over 60pc on 2010's 106c and 5.6pc ahead of brokers' 161c forecast. Short-term 
investment fluctuations and an increase in pension liabilities, driven by a lower discount rate, have partly eroded the 
benefit of retentions to net assets, which nonetheless are up over 15pc year-on-year at 630c per share. Shares in 
the insurer fell 21c to E8.70 as investors took profits. Its shares fell 25c to E8.65. Total Produce announced that it 
has received regulatory approval for its acquisition of 50pc of Dutch produce company Frankort and Koning. This 
deal was announced in December 2011 and at the time Total Produce expected it to be earnings enhancing from 
the date of completion. In 2010, Frankort and Koning recorded a turnover of E296m and realised average profits 
(after tax and minorities) of E2.7m over the past three years. Total Produce will pay an initial cash consideration of

E6m with the potential for this to be increased by another E9m depending on whether or not certain profit targets 
are met over the next few years. Shares in the Irish fresh foods group were flat at E0.46. Shares in Ryanair were 
down 4c at E4.19 after it said passenger numbers were down 2pc in February compared to a year earlier as it cut 
Winter capacity across its markets. Aer Lingus stocks were flat at E0.88 as investors await more word on what the 
Government will do with its shareholding. CRH stocks lost 22c to E16.13. Italcementi reported results after market 
close on Friday. Group sales as previously flagged rose 1.3pc year-on-year (yoy) to E4.72bn. 2011 EBITDA was 
E738m, down 12pc yoy and short of the Davy estimate of E745m (consensus forecasts were closer to E725m).

Building materials group CRH surprised on the upside for 2011 after a mild winter produced better than expected 
revenue in the last quarter of the year. Pretax profit rose 33 per cent to EUR 711 million on the back of EUR 18.1 
billion in sales. Chief executive Myles Lee said US economic data was encouraging and forecast more progress in 
2012, although higher energy costs and competition on pricing will be challenging. Lee said the group would look to 
expand in emerging markets, such as China where CRH already has a stake in the country's largest cement 
producer.
.........................
*Kingspan chief executive Gene Murtagh (pictured) predicted solid growth in the coming year as the building 
technology company reported a 30 per cent rise in revenue to EUR 1.55 billion for 2011, with strong volume growth 
in insulated panels across most regions. Trading profit rose 33 per cent from EUR 72 million to EUR 95.7 million, an 
increase of 24 per cent excluding acquisitions. The insulation panel maker is reportedly looking to Europe for 
possible acquisitions, as Murtagh felt the economic mood was improving.
.........................
*Aer Lingus was one of the few losers on the Iseq last week, which won't be good news for the government as it 
seeks buyers at over EUR 1 per share for its 25 per cent stake. It was trading at 88c when markets closed last 
Friday. Operating profit at the airline fell 6.4 per cent to EUR 49.1 million, but revenue rose 6 per cent to EUR 1.288 
billion, the airline said in its annual results for 2011. Passenger numbers rose 1.8 per cent to 9.5 million for the year. 
Chief executive Christoph Mueller noted "non controllable fuel price inflation, increased airport charges and 
challenging demand conditions" for the disappointing numbers.

*Shares in Glanbia raced to record highs last week as the dairy company boosted dividends on the back of a strong 
set of results for 2011. Revenue at Glanbia jumped 23.3 per cent to EUR 2.67 billion, despite another difficult year 
for the Irish retail food market. The company reported a 17.9 per cent rise in operating profit to EUR 161 million 
during 2011, underpinned by positive global dairy markets and growth in nutritional products. Speculation continues 
over a possible de-merger between the plc and the co-op, which owns a controlling stake, as the end of milk quotas 
in 2015 draws near.

*An independent study of Ormonde Mining's Barruecopardo tungsten project in Spain indicated that the project 
would deliver "exceptional economics", even at prices far below current market rates for the metal, the company 
said. Ormonde is seeking at least EUR 48.5 million in funding from its customers and industry partners to finance 
the extraction of the rare metal, which is widely used in industrial processes and manufacturing.

The ISEQ rallied for the third straight day today having gained over 60 points since Wednesday on renewed hopes 
that the wave of cash that the ECB has thrown at Europe's banks will stabilise markets.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 5.16 points to 3,243.80.
ECB President Mario Draghi has warned the euro zone against complacency and told leaders not to expect a 
further injection of long-term cash into their banks, according to officials. Addressing a dinner late on Thursday at an 
EU summit in Brussels, Draghi told the leaders the ECB's provision of more than 1 trillion euros of liquidity via a 
special loan programme had only won them a temporary reprieve and there could be no let-up in reforms.
Meanwhile, European shares turned lower after Spain signalled it will aim for a higher deficit this year than 
previously agreed with the European Union. At home, Shares in Grafton Group fell 4c to E3.40. The firm will 
announce results for 2011 on March 7th. Davy are forecasting revenues of E2.053bn, trading profits of E54.7m and 
diluted adjusted EPS of 15.3c. The broker's forecasts are consistent with the guidance provided by Grafton in its 
trading update of January 11th. At that point, the group indicated that revenues for the year were E2.05bn, up 2pc 
on 2010. It also said that trading profit would be at the upper end of the previously guided range of E52-55m. 
"Trading profit in 2010 was E50.6m, so we are forecasting an 8pc increase year-on-year (yoy). However, as trading 
profit rose 40pc yoy in H1, our full-year forecast effectively implies an 11pc yoy decline in the second half. The 
implied H2 forecasts reflect ongoing challenges in Ireland (we estimate revenues fell 5pc yoy in H2) and flat UK 
trading profits. As has been the case since 2009, the UK will be the main source of Grafton's profits," said Davy's 
Flor O'Donoghue. Ryanair has announced that it has purchased 9.5m shares at an average price of E4.11 per 
share, for a total consideration of E39m. In the recent Q2 results, the company commented on the likely E500m 
special dividend later this year and that it would also consider up to E200m of share repurchases this year. In the 
context of the latter figure, the buyback should be no surprise, says Goodbody's Eamonn Hughes, "though we note 
ISEQ rally goes in to third day ISEQ Up
management comments at the time that the last buyback was at E1 per share lower, which we interpreted to mean 
that they would only consider any buyback at lower than current levels". Ryanair's shares rose 4c to E4.24.

Irish airline Aer Lingus has defied Ireland's economic crisis by reporting strong growth in profits for 2011.
The Dublin-based carrier says in a statement Tuesday its full-year net profit rose 66 percent to (EURO)71.2 million 
($95.6 million). Sales rose 6 percent to (EURO)1.29 billion ($1.73 billion).
Aer Lingus competes with Ryanair on European short-haul routes and with several U.S. airlines on trans-Atlantic 
routes. Ryanair is Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder and seeks to acquire its main Irish rival, but the Irish government 
and EU regulators have blocked a takeover.
Aer Lingus says it carried more than 9.5 million passengers in 2011, a 1.8 percent gain, and its average cash yield 
per passenger rose 4.8 percent to (EURO)112.27 ($150.78) chiefly because it charged higher fares.

The ISEQ fell back today as global markets fretted about the rising cost of oil and despite a massive 23pc surge in 
Providence Resource's shares on the back of a new oil find.
The index fell 8.94 points to 3,191.31.
Shares in Irish energy explorer, Providence Resources, surged 77c to E4.20 after it reported that the Barryroe well 
(48/24-10z) has encountered a substantial section of oil-bearing reservoir sands in the basal section of the 
Wealden, a lower Cretaceous section off the Irish coast. "This is uniformly good news for Providence shareholders. 
While the ultimate test will be the rate at which the well flows, all the features required to achieve this outcome have 
been encountered so far. Better-than-expected thickness, good porosity and new technology all bode well for a 
successful flow-rate. We value Providence's share in Barryroe at 182p per share," said Davy's Job Langbroek.
Ryanair's stocks fell 6c to E4.04 after Merrion Stockbrokers said the airline's fuel bills will rise by up to 30pc over 
the next two years and it won't be able to recover all of this cost in higher fares, according to an analysis from 
Merrion Stockbrokers this morning. Analyst, Gerard Moore, is downgrading the airline's shares to "sell" from "Hold". 
"While Ryanair is likely to pay a special dividend of E500m in 2013, ultimately, earnings estimates will drive the 
share price. Over the next two years unit fuel costs will rise by 30pc. Non fuel unit costs are also rising. We believe 
the market overestimates Ryanair's ability to recover this cost inflation. Fares are already at a decade high level 
and have risen faster than peers over the last two years. The European consumer remains weak while capacity 
grows," he said. Kingspan has reported earnings of E91m for the 12 months to end Dec-11 (+35pc annually), which 
is ahead of Goodbody's forecasts of E83m and beat management guidance given in November of E82-85m. "At a 
divisional level, better than expected performances from Insulated Panels (helped by a stronger top-line), 
Environmental and Renewables (reflects one-off contract win in France with good margins) and Access Floors 
(continues to surprise on the upside, despite declining sales) more than offset a weaker than forecast outturn for 
ISEQ slips despite Providence shares ISEQ Falls
Insulation Boards," said analyst, Robert Eason. Shares in the group climbed 11c to E8.09. Shares in CRH fell 12c 
to E16.10. It will issue 2011 results tomorrow and the broker is forecasting EBITDA (core earnings) of E1.66bn and 
pre-tax profits (before impairments) of E733m. This is ahead of management guidance given in November of 
EBITDA of "approximately E1.6m" and profits to increase by E20-50m to E678-708m, reflecting the strong close to 
the year that most building materials companies have reported to date. "While it is clear that the recovery in the US 
residential market is gaining traction, we believe there are enough risks for management to be cautious in its 
outlook. These include: Continued uncertainty on a US multi-year highways programme, which was compounded 
last week by the House now looking for cuts again; Slowing growth in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands, which

The ISEQ fell back today as global markets fretted about the rising cost of oil and despite a massive 23pc surge in 
Providence Resource's shares on the back of a new oil find.
The index fell 8.94 points to 3,191.31.
Shares in Irish energy explorer, Providence Resources, surged 77c to E4.20 after it reported that the Barryroe well 
(48/24-10z) has encountered a substantial section of oil-bearing reservoir sands in the basal section of the 
Wealden, a lower Cretaceous section off the Irish coast. "This is uniformly good news for Providence shareholders. 
While the ultimate test will be the rate at which the well flows, all the features required to achieve this outcome have 
been encountered so far. Better-than-expected thickness, good porosity and new technology all bode well for a 
successful flow-rate. We value Providence's share in Barryroe at 182p per share," said Davy's Job Langbroek.
Ryanair's stocks fell 6c to E4.04 after Merrion Stockbrokers said the airline's fuel bills will rise by up to 30pc over 
the next two years and it won't be able to recover all of this cost in higher fares, according to an analysis from 
Merrion Stockbrokers this morning. Analyst, Gerard Moore, is downgrading the airline's shares to "sell" from "Hold". 
"While Ryanair is likely to pay a special dividend of E500m in 2013, ultimately, earnings estimates will drive the 
share price. Over the next two years unit fuel costs will rise by 30pc. Non fuel unit costs are also rising. We believe 
the market overestimates Ryanair's ability to recover this cost inflation. Fares are already at a decade high level 
and have risen faster than peers over the last two years. The European consumer remains weak while capacity 
grows," he said. Kingspan has reported earnings of E91m for the 12 months to end Dec-11 (+35pc annually), which 
is ahead of Goodbody's forecasts of E83m and beat management guidance given in November of E82-85m. "At a 
divisional level, better than expected performances from Insulated Panels (helped by a stronger top-line), 
Environmental and Renewables (reflects one-off contract win in France with good margins) and Access Floors 
(continues to surprise on the upside, despite declining sales) more than offset a weaker than forecast outturn for 
ISEQ slips despite Providence shares ISEQ Falls
Insulation Boards," said analyst, Robert Eason. Shares in the group climbed 11c to E8.09. Shares in CRH fell 12c 
to E16.10. It will issue 2011 results tomorrow and the broker is forecasting EBITDA (core earnings) of E1.66bn and 
pre-tax profits (before impairments) of E733m. This is ahead of management guidance given in November of 
EBITDA of "approximately E1.6m" and profits to increase by E20-50m to E678-708m, reflecting the strong close to 
the year that most building materials companies have reported to date. "While it is clear that the recovery in the US 
residential market is gaining traction, we believe there are enough risks for management to be cautious in its

The ISEQ fell back this morning as global markets fretted about the rising cost of oil and despite a massive 26pc 
surge in Providence Resource's shares on the back of a new oil find.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 14.86 points to 3,185.39.
Shares in Irish energy explorer, Providence Resources, surged 26pc or 89c to E4.32 after it reported that the 
Barryroe well (48/24-10z) has encountered a substantial section of oil-bearing reservoir sands in the basal section 
of the Wealden, a lower Cretaceous section off the Irish coast. The sands were intersected on prognoses and tie in 
well with the nearby 48/24-3 well and also the other wells drilled through the lower Wealden in this area. "This is 
uniformly good news for Providence shareholders in that it confirms the presence of lower Wealden sandstone in 
the first instance and the fact that it contains oil in the second. While the ultimate test will be the rate at which the 
well flows (at least 1,800 b/d if the well is to be commercial), all the features required to achieve this outcome have 
been encountered so far. Better-than-expected thickness, good porosity and new technology all bode well for a 
successful flow-rate. The next step is the flow test but so far so good. Based on the current 59m barrel resource 
estimate, we value Providence's share in Barryroe at 182p per share (459p unrisked)," said Davy's Job Langbroek.

which is ahead of Goodbody's forecasts of E83m and beat management guidance given in November of E82-85m. 
Adjusted EPS (based on diluted number of shares) was also 9pc ahead of the broker's estimates at 39.2c. "At a

Tourism organisations from across the island of Ireland joined Tourism Ireland in Milan for this year's BIT (Borsa 
Internazionale del Turismo), Italy's largest travel fair.
BIT attracts about 100,000 visitors each year, including many thousands of potential Italian holidaymakers, all 
looking for ideas and suggestions for their next short break or holiday destination.
The show also attracts influential Italian travel writers, tour operators, EFL (studying English as a Foreign 
Language) providers and travel agents, who can help spread the message about the fantastic holiday experience 
on offer in Ireland. With the introduction of new Ryanair flights from Italy this year - Milan (Bergamo) to Ireland West 
Airport Knock and Pisa to Cork - as well as the new Aer Lingus service from Verona to Dublin, the show provided a 
fantastic opportunity to highlight to potential visitors and influential travel professionals alike just how easy it now is 
to reach Ireland from Italy.
Niamh Kinsella, Tourism Ireland's manager in Italy, said: "Tourism Ireland has a busy promotional programme in 
place to grow visitor numbers from Italy in 2012, highlighting the island of Ireland as a fantastic holiday destination. 
The introduction of the new Ryanair and Aer Lingus flights is great news; as an island destination, direct, 
convenient and competitive access services are critical to achieving growth in inbound tourism and these services 
will expand options for Italian holidaymakers who want to visit the island of Ireland. Tourism Ireland is working hard 
to maximise the demand for these new routes and boost visitor numbers from Italy. Working with our industry 
partners in 2012, we will promote the distinctiveness of Ireland, the great value available and the ease of getting 
there from Italy."

Tourism organisations from across the island of Ireland joined Tourism Ireland in Milan for this year's BIT (Borsa 
Internazionale del Turismo), Italy's largest travel fair.
BIT attracts about 100,000 visitors each year, including many thousands of potential Italian holidaymakers, all 
looking for ideas and suggestions for their next short break or holiday destination.
The show also attracts influential Italian travel writers, tour operators, EFL (studying English as a Foreign 
Language) providers and travel agents, who can help spread the message about the fantastic holiday experience 
on offer in Ireland. With the introduction of new Ryanair flights from Italy this year - Milan (Bergamo) to Ireland West 
Airport Knock and Pisa to Cork - as well as the new Aer Lingus service from Verona to Dublin, the show provided a 
fantastic opportunity to highlight to potential visitors and influential travel professionals alike just how easy it now is 
to reach Ireland from Italy.
Niamh Kinsella, Tourism Ireland's manager in Italy, said: "Tourism Ireland has a busy promotional programme in 
place to grow visitor numbers from Italy in 2012, highlighting the island of Ireland as a fantastic holiday destination. 
The introduction of the new Ryanair and Aer Lingus flights is great news; as an island destination, direct, 
convenient and competitive access services are critical to achieving growth in inbound tourism and these services 
will expand options for Italian holidaymakers who want to visit the island of Ireland. Tourism Ireland is working hard 
to maximise the demand for these new routes and boost visitor numbers from Italy. Working with our industry 
partners in 2012, we will promote the distinctiveness of Ireland, the great value available and the ease of getting 
there from Italy."

Highlight: Ryanair's fuel bills will rise by up to 30pc over the next two years and it won't be able to recover all of 
this cost in higher fares, according to an analysis from Merrion Stockbrokers this morning.
Body
Ryanair's fuel bills will rise by up to 30pc over the next two years and it won't be able to recover all of this cost in 
higher fares, according to an analysis from Merrion Stockbrokers this morning.
Analyst, Gerard Moore, is downgrading the airline's shares to "sell" from "Hold".
"While Ryanair is likely to pay a special dividend of E500m in FY13, ultimately, earnings estimates will drive the 
share price. Over the next two years unit fuel costs will rise by 30pc. Non fuel unit costs are also rising. We believe 
the market overestimates Ryanair's ability to recover this cost inflation. Fares are already at a decade high level 
and have risen faster than peers over the last two years. The European consumer remains weak while capacity 
grows. Given this earnings risk we downgrade the stock to Sell from Hold. Our FY14 EPS forecast is 16pc below 
consensus," he said.
"We are sceptical that Ryanair can recover all of this cost inflation. Ryanair's average fare is up 30pc since FY10 
and is now at a decade high level. The discount on its average fare to peers has declined from 44pc to 31pc over 
the last two years. European unemployment above 10pc will hinder demand, while airlines continue to increase 
capacity this summer, making it tougher to achieve real yield increases. We expect Ryanair to recover 90pc of cost 
inflation in FY13 and FY14 on a per pax basis. Easyjet's H1 guidance suggests a recovery rate of 80pc. Consensus 
forecasts for Ryanair, however, imply a rate of 97pc in FY13 and 142pc in FY14. Put another way, Ryanair will need 
to increase its yield by 8pc in FY13 and by another 8pc in FY14 to meet consensus expectations. This suggests 
that Ryanair will benefit from a favourable mix effect for another two years or that Ryanair has real pricing power. 
Ryanair itself admits that its pricing power is "somewhat limited". Our EPS forecast FY14 is 16pc below consensus."

Non-Irish citizens living in Ireland will not be able to avoid administrative card charges when booking a flight with 
Ryanair under a new scheme.
From March 1, Ryanair passengers who use the airline's pre-paid payment method, Ryanair's Cash Passport, can 
escape card charges of EUR 6 per flight per passenger. Users must put a minimum of EUR 175 on the card, which 
cannot be used until it is received in the post, and must also pay a top-up fee each time they load more money onto 
the card and an ATM fee for withdrawing cash.
However, only Irish residents with an Irish passport can apply for the card, meaning that passengers of other 
nationalities living in Ireland will face higher charges for flights. "You do need an Irish passport to purchase the card 
in Ireland," a Ryanair spokeswoman said, adding that the card was already available in some other markets.
The Ryanair Cash Passport card was launched in Britain last September, and in Italy in November. According to 
Ryanair, it will be rolled out in other European countries in the coming months.
The MasterCard prepaid card, which is managed by Access Prepaid Worldwide, will replace other MasterCard 
prepaid cards as the only way to avoid Ryanair's EUR 6 per flight administration fee for bookings originating in 
Ireland from March 1. "All Irish bookings made with any other card will attract Ryanair's EUR 6 admin fee," said a 
Ryanair statement on the launch of the card.
According to a customer services agent at Access Prepaid Worldwide, the company is only accepting applications 
made online from Irish residents holding an Irish passport. "This is due to our legal requirements to check your 
identity and the methods available online to do this," the agent said. "We are looking at paper-based alternatives to 
accept applications from Irish residents holding different passports in the future."

Ryanair is suing the Irish Airline Pilots Association (IALPA) in the High Court over the use of the Ryanair logo on the 
association's website.
The website includes images of aircraft from a series of airlines with the caption: "IALPA has members depicted in 
the airlines shown."
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary refuses to negotiate directly with unions such as IALPA, which is part of the Impact 
trade union.
A statement from Ryanair's PR firm, Edelman, said: "Many of Ryanair's employees are members of 'unions' but, in 
relation to pay and other terms and conditions, they negotiate directly with Ryanair through directly-elected pilot 
representatives' committees."
IALPA has urged Ryanair pilots to sign a "commitment to pilot unity" form, which will allow the European Cockpit 
Association (ECA) to "gauge how ready you are as professional pilots to support each other and become unified". 
The ECA, which represents almost 40,000 European pilots and flight engineers in 38 European countries, met last 
week to discuss the Ryanair issue.
IALPA did not return calls about the Ryanair court action, and Ryanair said it had "no further information to disclose" 
about the case.
Ryanair also refused to comment on two other High Court actions it has brought this year against the Revenue 
Commissioners and the Equality Tribunal.
The tribunal and the Revenue Commissioners also declined to comment.

On Monday a group of colleagues returned from Budapest, armed with tales of tasty sweets and tantalisingly cheap 
real estate in the city centre. My colleague Andrew also mentioned a somewhat distressing scene at the Hungarian 
capital's airport.
"It was quite sad to see all those blue-nosed Malev planes lined up with nowhere to go," he said. "It's even more 
depressing that Ryanair looks set to become Hungary's new national carrier."
While airline collapses have become commonplace, with Spanair and Air Australia also going under over the past 
few weeks, the loss of national carriers is a less frequent phenomenon - in part because of the emotions wrapped 
up in seeing once-loved tailfins permanently parked, in part because a flag carrier is often considered a cornerstone 
for economic development. We've seen high-profile bankruptcies - Swissair in Switzerland and Sabena in Belgium 
immediately come to mind - but in both these cases the public and private sector worked hard to get their flags back 
on the fuselages of Boeings and Airbuses, albeit under slightly re-jigged brands. Both are also good examples of 
why small countries need their own airlines: to stimulate trade, boost tourism and assert their sovereignty.
Conventional wisdom suggests that states have no business running airlines. Indeed, the past few decades have 
seen most major economies sell their flag carriers to other airline groups or list them on the local bourse - often 
keeping minority stakes for sentimental purposes. The results have been mixed at best.
While I'm all for a free and open market, I also believe there's a need for governments to offer essential services to 
their citizens - particularly when the free market is unlikely to fill the gap. In the case of countries that have small 
populations, or lack strategic hubs, this also means underwriting the national airline. Consultants might argue that 
this is unnecessary, as other airlines will swoop in to soak up demand, but there's considerably more at stake than 
just ensuring every flight boasts an 80 per cent load factor.
A national airline is an embassy with wings, transporting culture, sports teams, cuisine (some airlines do actually 
serve decent food when they stick to national dishes), commerce and goodwill around the world. Air New Zealand is 
a flying example of Kiwi resourcefulness and ingenuity, with clever cabin configurations on their long-haul fleet, an

emphasis on New Zealand wines and reputable Kiwi chefs consulting on the menus. A flag carrier instills a sense of 
pride when its tail is spotted on the runway of a far-off land, when it brings home the winning team and when it flies 
out to evacuate citizens stranded in a conflict or disaster zone.
In an increasingly globalised world, smart governments recognise the importance of having their flags fluttering on 
as many routes as possible - a message that certainly hasn't been lost on Singapore, whose government indirectly 
owns Singapore Airlines, or the emirs in Dubai who control Emirates. In both cases, these small states have made 
their airlines part of their national identity and growth strategy. Unsurprisingly, consultants who are against 
governments running airlines often leave Emirates and Singapore Airlines out of their presentations as they pretty 
much shatter the theory.
At the moment there's talk in Finland of selling off state-backed Finnair - either in parts or the whole business. 
Having spent decades exploiting the fast travel times across the top of the world, Finnair may have carved out a 
unique position in international aviation. But it's still a solution that is unlikely to be particularly attractive to outside 
investors. Is Lufthansa really going to invest in a hub on the far side of the Baltic? Ditto Air France-KLM or Qatar 
Airways.
As governments around the world continue to tighten their belts, they also have to remember there are some things 
you simply have to protect. Having an airline to call your own is useful for getting your citizens around the world and 
bringing in visitors to invest and marvel at your achievements - just as it's important to maintain respectable looking 
embassies rather than getting your diplomats to work on iPads in the lobbies of Novotels.
I wonder what will happen the next time a group of Hungarian tourists need to be airlifted out of a sunny banana 
republic that's just seen its government implode; will Budapest have to put a call through to the offices of Ryanair in 
Dublin to organise an evacuation? Or will they have to go and book online? And what happens if Finland wins the 
World Cup (small chance I know) and the team needs to fly home for a heroes' welcome? How will it look to Finns 
and the rest of the world when their team steps out of an aircraft belonging to Norwegian Air Shuttle? So much for 
national pride or dignity on the world stage, or any sense of sovereignty.

The main Dublin shares index barely moved this morning as investors mulled the implications of a forecast of a 
return to recession for the eurozone.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 4.02 points to 3,171.04.
The euro zone's economy is heading into its second recession in just three years, while the wider European Union 
will stagnate, the EU's executive said, warning that the currency area has yet to break its vicious cycle of debt. 
However, the EU's top economics official said that recent surveys pointed to just a mild slowdown for the euro zone. 
"Recent developments in survey data suggest that the expected slowdown will be rather mild and temporary," EU 
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told a news briefing following the release of the European 
Commission's interim report on the EU economy.
Shares in CRH fell 14c to E15.94. The group will report full year results for 2011 on Tuesday next. Davy are 
forecasting EBITDA (core earnings) of E1620m, up marginally from E1614m in 2010, and pre-tax profits of E677m, 
up from E534m reported last year. The broker's forecasts for EBITDA and profits are slightly ahead of consensus. 
"We are forecasting EPS (pre-exceptionals and amortisation) of 82c, broadly in line with consensus. We believe the 
dividend will be maintained at 62.5c with over E700m (98c per share) in free cash flow (pre-acquisitions and 
dividend) well capable of supporting this level," said analyst, Barry Dixon. In its trading update in November, CRH 
reported that the EBITDA in its Americas Materials division in Q3 was lower year-on-year as a result of poor 
weather. Performance in its European Products division was also behind as growth slowed and margins came 
under pressure. Its European and Americas Distribution divisions were ahead as was its Americas Product division. 
The Irish government has indicated the following in relation to the state's stake in Aer Lingus: "Consideration will be 
given to the sale of the state's remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus when market conditions are favourable and at 
an acceptable price to government". Aer Lingus will report its full year results on February 28th. Previous comments

from the Transport Minister would suggest that a sale of the Irish state's shareholding (25pc) in Aer Lingus won't be 
considered at anything less than E1. According to our research, Aer Lingus is still significantly undervalued at its 
current price assuming a reasonable resolution of pension issues. Finding a resolution to the company's pension 
commitments will be necessary before any sale is completed. Aer Lingus shares dipped 1c to E0.94. Ryanair's 
stocks fell 1c to E4.07. The airline today said it has entered in to a deal with 888.com to offer gambling on the 
Ryanair website. APN News and Media (APN), in which Independent News and Media (INM) has a 31pc stake, has 
reported full year results that are in line with both expectations and guidance. Group EBIT was dollar 171.4m versus 
guidance of dollar 171-173m. Importantly from an INM perspective, group net profit after tax was dollar 78.2m 
(Davy: dollar 78.3m) and a dividend of 5c per share (Davy: 5c) was declared - taking the total dividend for the full 
year to 8.5c. Shares in the Indo group rose 2c to E0.25.

The main Dublin shares index rose - though only just - today as investors mulled the implications of a forecast of a 
return to recession for the eurozone.
The index rose 3.86 points to 3,170.70.
The euro zone's economy is heading into its second recession in just three years, while the wider European Union 
will stagnate, the EU's executive said, warning that the currency area has yet to break its vicious cycle of debt. 
However, the EU's top economics official said that recent surveys pointed to just a mild slowdown for the euro zone. 
"Recent developments in survey data suggest that the expected slowdown will be rather mild and temporary," EU 
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told a news briefing following the release of the European 
Commission's interim report on the EU economy.

EU regulators are investigating whether three regional German airports and one in Austria may have breached EU 
state aid rules in setting lower charges for budget airlines Ryanair, Lufthansa's Germanwings and Air Berlin.
The European Commission said in a statement it would also look into capital injections and operating aid granted by 
German authorities to the airports at Saarbruecken, Zweibruecken, Luebeck-Blankensee and those provided by 
Austrian authorities to Klagenfurt airport.
The investigation, launched on Wednesday, is the latest move by the European Union executive against airports 
suspected of receiving unfair support. The Commission is also investigating possible illegal aid for airports in 
France, Sweden, Ireland, Hungary and Romania.
"On the basis of the information at its disposal the Commission cannot exclude that the measures in favour of the 
four airports and their customer airlines involve state aid which gives them an unfair advantage vis- -vis their 
competitors and is thus incompatible with the internal market," the statement said. It cited concerns with discounted 
user charges offered by Saarbruecken airport to Cirrus Airlines and Air Berlin, Zweibrueken aiport's lower charges 
for Germanwings, TUIfly and Ryanair, and Luebeck-Blankensee airport's deals with Ryanair. It also pointed to 
Klagenfurt airport's discounted scheme for Ryanair, TUIfly and Air Berlin. Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest 
carrier, is partly owned by Gulf airline Etihad. TUIfly is controlled by German travel group TUI AG. The Commission 
can order national authorities to recover aid if this is found to have infringed EU state aid rules. (C ) Reuters

Ryanair said it would cut five routes from its summer schedule at Edinburgh Airport just as shortlisted bidders in the 
contest to acquire one of the UK's fastest growing airports begin due diligence.
The Irish carrier blamed its decision, which should reduce passenger numbers by 300,000 this year, on the airport 
owner's refusal to reduce take-off and landing fees. "While Ryanair remains committed to Edinburgh Airport . . . 
BAA Edinburgh cannot continue to ignore the competitive marketplace," said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief 
executive.
BAA played down the capacity cuts, pointing out that three of the routes on the chopping block - from Edinburgh to 
Malmo, Murcia and Ibiza - were launched only last month, and questioned Mr O'Leary's assertion that the changes 
would endanger 300 jobs at the airport.
"BAA employs 500 people at the airport in total, so the job losses they're talking about do seem excessive," the 
company said.
But the spat underscores the challenges for future owners of the airport, which BAA is selling under orders from the 
UK Competition Commission . Shortlisted bidders are understood to include Global Infrastructure Partners; 
JPMorgan Asset Management; and consortiums led by the private equity groups 3i and Carlyle.

Body
Ryanair today said it has launched a High Court case against Budget Travel for alleged breach of Ryanair.com's 
Terms of Use and intellectual property rights.
The no-frills airline asked the Court to prohibit Budget Travel from what it says is unauthorised screenscraping and 
reselling of Ryanair seats.
It says it allows and encourages "price comparison only" websites to access its timetable and pricing information, 
for an annual charitable donation of just E100.
"Budget Travel has no permission or agreement with Ryanair and we have been forced to take legal action to insist 
that they immediately desist from unlawfully scraping and selling Ryanair's low fare flights often at inflated prices to 
unsuspecting consumers," said a Ryanair spokesman. "Ryanair allows third party websites to display our lowest 
fares, for price comparison purposes only, if they sign a licence agreement and make an annual charitable donation 
of E100. Budget Travel has no such licence and is scraping and reselling Ryanair seats in contravention of our

Ryanair today said it has launched a High Court case against Budget Travel for alleged breach of Ryanair.com's 
Terms of Use and intellectual property rights.
The no-frills airline asked the Court to prohibit Budget Travel from what it says is unauthorised screenscraping and 
reselling of Ryanair seats.
It says it allows and encourages "price comparison only" websites to access its timetable and pricing information, 
for an annual charitable donation of just E100.
"Budget Travel has no permission or agreement with Ryanair and we have been forced to take legal action to insist 
that they immediately desist from unlawfully scraping and selling Ryanair's low fare flights often at inflated prices to 
unsuspecting consumers," said a Ryanair spokesman. "Ryanair allows third party websites to display our lowest 
fares, for price comparison purposes only, if they sign a licence agreement and make an annual charitable donation 
of E100. Budget Travel has no such licence and is scraping and reselling Ryanair seats in contravention of our 
policies, with mark-up charges and without providing passengers with our terms and conditions or Ryanair with

March will bring new Aer Lingus flights from Dublin to Stockholm and Verona. In April, Ryanair will launch new 
routes from Knock to Milan, Paris, Frankfurt and Barcelona. From Cork, the airline will also fly to Verona, Pisa and 
Palma.
This is all welcome news, so why does it still seem like Michael O'Leary is going out of his way to discourage 
passengers from flying?
By this, I don't mean the Ryanair boss posing alongside calendar girls in his swim trunks.
I mean his airline's plans to hike its online fees this summer by 25 per cent to EUR 25 for the first bag. Pay for a 
second bag at the airport, and the charge rockets to an eye-watering EUR 120.
When charges were introduced in 2006, they were a paltry EUR 3.50 per bag, but, of course, Ryanair isn't alone in 
all of this.
Aer Lingus charges from EUR 15 per bag. While both airlines offer a 10kg cabin allowance, however, Aer Lingus at 
least permits a second laptop, handbag or baby bag, whereas Ryanair insists everything be crammed into a single 
bag.
So, with ancillary charges heading north and reduced capacity, rising fuel costs and the EU's new 'green levy', how 
can passengers keep their costs down?
First off, Ryanair's EUR 6 booking fee can be avoided by paying with a prepaid MasterCard -- for example, 
moneybookers.ie. The online check-in fee can be dodged by buying promotional fares -- the all-singing, all-dancing 
offers on the home page, which generally include it free of charge.
Abroad: Beating baggage charges for good
The only simple way to avoid checked baggage fees is not to check bags, limiting yourself to the carry-on 
allowance. Given that wheelie cases can weigh upwards of 3kg before you pack so much as a pair of undies, 
however, this is no mean feat -- particularly for longer or family trips.
The trick is to make a list of essential items (preferably not in panic mode before a trip), pack light and weigh your 
bags at home. You should aim to come in around 1.5kg under the 10kg limit -- think of it as breathing space for 
dodgy airport scales or duty-free shopping. Ryanair charges EUR 20 per kilo of excess weight, so err on the side of 
caution to avoid getting stung at the airport.
If you can't meet the weight restrictions, then you need to pay extra, or consider flying with a full-service airline such 
as BMI or SAS, which include a checked bag in the ticket price.
Much has been made of the 'poacher' jackets laced with pockets into which passengers can cram extra clothes and 
sundries. But I've yet to see one in action.
What I have seen is passengers wearing several layers of clothes or travelling in their hiking boots, to lighten the 
load. It's not the most comfortable way to fly, or pass through security, but it could save you money.
One other tip: check your spelling before buying tickets. Name change fees cost EUR 110 with Ryanair, and can be 
levied even if a single letter differs between passport and ticket.

A private tower in Bologna
If you're looking for an exclusive retreat full of history and romance, stay at the Prendiparte Tower in the heart of 
medieval Bologna in Italy. The tower, which dates back to the 12th century, is in a hidden maze of narrow streets 
and has a bird's eye view over the city; a couple can have the tower all to themselves.
At 60 metres, Prendiparte is the tallest tower in the city after the Asinelli Tower. With walls up to two metres thick, 
the tower was once a military stronghold but is now an exclusive one-bedroom retreat: you get your own key to the 
giant wooden tower door and are not disturbed.
The sitting room is full of art, books, CDs and antiques, while there is a double bedroom on the mezzanine floor. 
There's also a large, fully-equipped kitchen.
The accommodation suite is on the lower levels, and you can climb to the roof to watch the sunset and see the city 
at night. For a really special occasion, arrange a romantic dinner for two or a rooftop musical recital.
The tower's suite costs from EUR 250 per night; tel: 39-51-589023 or see prendiparte.it. Aer Lingus flights from 
Dublin to Bologna cost from EUR 55.99 one way including taxes and charges, direct flights start on 25 March, see 
aerlingus.com.

**A treehouse on the French Riviera**
Sleeping in a treehouse and listening to the swishing of the trees in the breeze and the sounds of nature is deeply 
relaxing. Your only neighbours are squirrels and birds, and your alarm clock is their song.
Abroad: Six of the best romantic getaways
For a truly romantic retreat, the Orion treehouses, in a quiet and exclusive setting in the valley of Saint-Paul de 
Vence on the French Riviera, are a must. Each treehouse is different and they blend into the woods, with great 
views of nature and the surrounding estate.
The treehouse is a great way to spend a relaxing evening with your partner, enjoying the peace and quiet, with a 
focus on nature, wellbeing and simplicity. In winter, the treehouse becomes a cosy retreat and couples can take a 
sauna, have a massage or just curl up with a book, while in summer, there's a natural outdoor pool for summer 
dips; couples can also arrange a gourmet picnic basket with champagne.
Treehouses sleep two or more and start from EUR 350 for two nights including breakfast; for more information, see 
orionbb.com.
Ryanair flights from Dublin to Nice start from EUR 40.99 one-way including taxes and charges; see ryanair.com. 
Aer Lingus flights from Cork to Nice start on 27 March and from Dublin to Nice start on 25 April, from EUR 55.99 
one way including taxes and charges; see aerlingus.com.

**An island lighthouse in Croatia**
A private lighthouse provides the ultimate romantic escape and superb views, with lighthouses -- by their nature -- 
designed to face the open sea.
There are private lighthouses to stay in around the world (including in Ireland), but some of the best are in Croatia, 
with the added benefits of blue skies; the clear, warm seas of the Adriatic to bathe in; and perfect positioning for 
romantic sunsets.
Some lighthouses are totally secluded, set in remote locations such as a rock out to sea, a small island or a 
peninsula, providing exclusive retreats away from the hustle and bustle. Others are nearer to villages, towns or 
tourist centres.
Porer Lighthouse in north Croatia was built in 1833. The tower is 35 metres high and is on an islet of the same 
name, south-west of Istria's southernmost cape and 2.5 kilometres from the mainland. There are many beautiful 
bays and islets in the vicinity of Porer, and the sunsets that can be seen from here are considered to be some of the 
most beautiful on the Adriatic.
Rental of Porer costs from EUR 69 per day up to May 26, EUR 89 per day in June and EUR 119 per day from July 
to September. Transfers cost EUR 100 return from Premantura.
For information and more lighthouse rentals, see adriatica.net or tel: +44-207-1830437.

**A canal-trip in Venice**
Sailing along Venice's sweeping Giudecca Canal is romantic enough in itself, but gliding past the glorious, 
crumbling palaces and out into the lagoon on board one of the world's most beautiful sailing ships adds a whole 
new dimension.
The Star Clipper is a tall ship designed in the traditional clipper style with wooden and brass fittings, but also all 
types of modern comforts. Measuring 360 feet in length, the ship carries just 170 guests and has 16 sails to power it 
along in the breeze.
A five-night mini-break with Star Clippers and Kirker Holidays provides a night in a four-star Venice hotel to explore 
after the crowds have departed, setting sail the next day to explore some of Croatia's most fashionable anchorages: 
Mali Losinj, Hvar and Rovinj.
Abroad: Six of the best romantic getaways
The trip, which departs on July 27, costs from EUR 839 per person sharing. To book, tel: 0856-2006145 or visit 
starclippers.co.uk.
Aer Lingus flights from Dublin to Venice start at EUR 55.99 one-way including taxes and charges; see 
aerlingus.com. Ryanair flights from Dublin to Venice Treviso airport start from EUR 31.99 one way, including taxes 
and charges; see ryanair.com.

**A trip on the Orient Express**
A trip on the Orient Express is on many people's romantic wishlist. The journey from London to Venice via Paris on 
the legendary Venice Simplo Orient Express is one of the most famous in the world, with each carriage having a 
special history and rich decor.
Prices per person start from EUR 2,370 based on two adults sharing and include all meals on board.
If your budget doesn't stretch that far, try a daytrip in Britain on the British Pullman or its sister train, the Northern 
Belle.
Both day trains operate day and weekend trips from London and other locations to spectacular cities and stately 
homes in Britain, with prices starting from a more modest EUR 211 per person.
For reservations, see orient-ex press.com or call +44-203-1171300.

**A cliff-top hotel in Waterford**
Ireland is full of secluded locations for romantic breaks and, with prices coming down in many of the five-star castle 
hotels and country houses and plenty of special offers, this could be the year to escape for a romantic weekend.
The Cliff House Hotel in Waterford is in an area of unspoilt natural beauty, and the cliff-top walk and sandy beach 
provide plenty of romantic settings.
Romantic foodies will also love the restaurant -- and you can even contribute to your own meal by going foraging.
The hotel can arrange guided nature walks with an expert, where you can hunt for mushrooms, forage along the 
seaside, watch for whales and dolphins or just admire the beautiful countryside.
The hotel's Couples Spa Suite opened at the start of the month with a 'his and hers' twin treatment room boasting 
panoramic view over Ardmore Bay. The room is situated beside the Cliff House's twin outdoor seaweed baths.
One night for two people in a deluxe sea view room, with breakfast, a full body massage and seaweed bath each is 
EUR 440 until June 1. Tel: 024 87800 or visit thecliffhousehotel.com.

Seasoned business travellers will, by now, be well used to seeking out cheaper flights in order to save their 
employers money, but what about travelling in and around your destination?
Just as airlines have frequent flyer programmes, loyalty or points schemes are a long-established part of the 
packages offered to business customers by the main global car rental firms.
Most schemes, such as those from Hertz, Budget, National and Avis, will offer at least 15 per cent off future rentals 
-- and sometimes even free rentals. There are other perks too, such as shorter queues, reserved cars and free or 
cheap upgrades.
Choosing which company to go for, on the basis of their points schemes, can be difficult as there may not be a lot to 
distinguish them, but one easy way to help guide your choice is to go with the scheme that is allied most closely to 
your airline frequent flyer programme.
With most airlines, you can score some flyer miles while you drive. Both Aer Lingus and Ryanair have tie-in 
discounted deals with Hertz, and you can avail of more if you are a member of Hertz's loyalty scheme, the 1 Club.
Some global firms, such as Enterprise Rent a Car, don't offer such schemes in Europe. Spencer King, European 
corporate communications manager with Enterprise, said the best way to cheaper rates was through forging links 
with a rental company at home.
"First, it allows the business to negotiate more favourable terms based on the level of rental they will use from the 
supplier in their home market," he said.
"You then have two options, depending on how much overseas rental you need. If there is a significant amount of 
travel then, as part of the domestic tender, a company could also look to negotiate overseas rental rates with the 
same supplier or any affiliated partners they may have."
Business: Be in the driving seat
Depending on the extent of your overseas rental needs, you might also be interested in a new and fast-growing 
sector of the car hire industry-- car-sharing clubs. Car-sharing is a new category of 'pay as you go', high street-
based, short-term car hire where you can rent a car by the hour instead of having to pay a daily rate.
For instance, car club provider Zipcar -- which has several bases across cities in the US and Britain -- allows you to 
hire a car in London during the week from just £5 an hour.
This includes fuel, insurance and even the London congestion charge, but excludes mileage charges, but you get 
40 free miles in this case, and thereafter the charge of 25p a mile.
As with all clubs, you have to pay a membership fee (in this case £60 a year), but City Car Club, another provider, 
charges just £1 annual membership if you are already a member of a rival car sharing club.
Although the concept has been around for a few years in the US, Britain and parts of Europe and, to date, has been 
run by small, independent operators, the mainstream car hire firms are muscling in on the act.
Hertz has created a new service called Hertz On Demand. Previously named Connect by Hertz, this is much like a 
car club, but without the membership fees. Prices to hire a car in London start at £5.50 an hour, with the first 20 
miles free and 25p per mile thereafter.
Enterprise runs a similar but more business-oriented scheme in the US, Britain and Canada called WeCar. 
"Because it is used in a B2B environment, it's often priced on a monthly basis to the employer, who then manages 
the use of it through their internal travel policy," said King.
John Barry, head of sales and marketing at Hertz Ireland, said car sharing was proving more attractive now to 
business users because, more often than not, they didn't need a car for the whole day. When it comes to cutting 
costs, many business customers are choosing to use the smallest cars they need, rather than opt for bigger 
upgrades.
King said: "Our experience suggests that the expectations of renters to receive free upgrades have diminished. In 
fact, many businesses we work with request we do not provide this option. Choosing a smaller more economical 
vehicle is the simplest way to manage costs."
.........................
**TIPS AND TRAPS**
**Don't buy extra insurance**
Car rental companies often ask if you want to increase the insurance cover on your car rental. Most of the time, you 
don't need it. Instead, call the insurance provider on your personal vehicle or business fleet to make sure you're 
already covered.
**Downsize your rental car**
The extra legroom and comfort is nice, but opt for the smallest size if you don't plan on driving clients around. The 
savings can add up, especially for longer trips.
**Use deal-finding websites**
If you are an occasional rather than a frequent overseas car renter, using deal-finding websites such as ebookers or 
Lastminute.com can result in useful discounts on car rental.
**Consider car-sharing clubs**
It's not as widely available yet as traditional rental, but car-sharing services are fast expanding, and are well worth it 
if you only need a car for an hour or two.
Business: Be in the driving seat
**Go for hybrid or electric**
More rental providers are adding electric cars to their fleets, so if you don't have too far to go, but need a car for a 
full day, then you could usefully save on fuel charges.
**Bring your own sat-nav**
Most sat-navs are charged at a rate of about EUR 10 to EUR 15 per day. But if you are the kind of person who can't 
do without a sat-nav, the chances are you will bring your own device with you, or your smartphone will have a GPS-
based mobile app.

Ryanair will pursue an appeal to the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg today against the current EU 261 
regulations which impose obligations on airlines during "act of God" events like the volcanic ash cloud of 2010.
Ryanair claims the regulations are discriminatory and unfit for purpose. It claims: "[The regulations] impose an

Defending a test case, taken by a passenger who travelled with the airline to Faro and became stranded for 9 days 
as a result of the volcanic ash airspace closures, Ryanair is taking its claims to the Court of Justice.
The airline wants the court to rule on whether the airspace closures are considered "extraordinary circumstances" 
and whether airlines should be required to compensate passengers when travel insurance companies do not. It is 
also attempting to have the duty of care required by EU261 capped in monetary value and/or duration. Stephen 
McNamara, head of combinations at Ryanair, says: "Ryanair believes that the current EU passenger rights 
legislation is both discriminatory and unfit for purpose as it does not place airlines on an equal footing with 
competing road, rail and sea transport providers. EU261 places an unlimited right to care and compensation liability

The so-called "airline fat tax" is one step closer to approval in England after a Court of Appeal ruling that stated 
fliers cannot sue for embarrassment caused when on board a plane.
The judgment could also prevent passengers with a disability from seeking compensation from an airline if they 
receive unsatisfactory or inconsistent treatment during a flight.
Judges considered two cases involving wheelchair users on Thomas Cook and British Airways who sued the 
airlines after they were unable to sit next to their caretakers on board. Both subsequently had "embarrassing" 
incidents.
However both cases were dismissed when the court decided that the Montreal Convention, a framework of 
international regulations on air travel, should take priority over British law.
Judges came to the conclusion that key elements of Britain's disability and discrimination laws don't apply once 
passengers board an aircraft. The decision could lead to airlines introducing a tax against obese passengers 
without fear of consequences, a leading barrister claims.
Daniel Barnett, of the Outer Temple Chambers in London, argued that the decision means passengers could not 
sue if crew cause distress on board. He said the ruling would give airlines "laissez-faire to disregard seat allocation 
promises" made prior to boarding and prohibit passengers from suing airlines for "hurt feelings" or emotional 
distress.
"The ruling confirms that disabled passengers have no right to dignity once the wheels leave the runway," said 
Barnett. "It also means that airlines are immune if they choose to embarrass overweight passengers by demanding 
a fat tax."
An airline "fat tax" has been discussed before by airlines like Ryanair following a survey conducted by the airline 
that suggested around a third of passengers supported it.
Several carriers across the globe already insist that obese passengers purchase an extra seat if they are unable to 
comfortably fit into one.
Airline Fat Tax One Step Closer to Fruition
In the States, United dealt with a PR headache when it forced passengers who were too large to fit in one economy 
seat to buy another. Southwest recently announced that starting in March, its subsidiary AirTran will require 
overweight passengers to purchase a second seat if they cannot fit in one with the armrest lowered.
Air Canada, meanwhile, is facing a lawsuit from obese passengers who claim they were mistreated on flights in 
2008. Over in Australia, former Qantas economist Tony Webber has suggested that heavier people should pay 
more to fly.
Webber reasoned that if people are charged for overweight baggage, they should be charged for excess weight as 
well. He rationalized that the more a plane weighs, the more fuel it burns, the more it costs to fly the plane, and the 
more you end up paying.
A poll carried out by AOL Travel shows that most people agree. Seventy-one percent of the 10,000 people polled 
said overweight people should pay more to fly.

SAS, the struggling Scandinavian airline group, yesterday warned of a weak start to 2012 after reporting its fourth 
consecutive full-year net loss.
The company unveiled plans to accelerate a cost-cutting programme, involving 300 job losses, after recording a net 
loss of SKr1.7bn ($256m) for 2011.
The airline is facing increased competition from low-cost carriers led by Ryanair and Norwegian Air Shuttle, as well 
as high fuel prices.
Rickard Gustafson, chief executive, said: "The challenging nature of the prevailing economic climate in combination 
with the earnings effect of [the cost-saving programme] being realised in the latter part of 2012 mean that the 
seasonally weak first quarter will also remain weak in 2012."
He added that yields - a measure of the average fare paid by passengers - would continue to come under pressure 
in 2012 after falling by 2 per cent year on year at the main SAS airline in 2011. The group's load factor - the number 
of seats occupied on flights - also deteriorated in 2011.
SAS reported a net loss of SKr2.1bn for the three months to December 31, compared with a profit of SKr47m in the 
fourth quarter of 2010. Revenue fell by 4.6 per cent in the fourth quarter to SKr10.2bn.
For the full year, SAS generated SKr41.4bn of revenue, up 0.8 per cent compared with 2010.

Ryanair has announced plans to expand its new Budapest base which will open on February 17. 
&#8232;&#8232;The airline says it has received record bookings on 31 routes since releasing fares to the Budapest 
airport following the closure of Malev.
It now says it will expand the Budapest base to add a fifth aircraft from March 26. An additional route will add flights 
from Budapest to Tampere and 42 more weekly flights to destinations including Brussels, Madrid, Gothenburg and 
Rome.
Ryanair predicts that Budapest traffic will grown to 2.4m passengers in its first year and provide 2,400 jobs for 
Hungary's tourist industry.
Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary, says: "Ryanair will invest more than USD250m in its new five aircraft Budapest

SCANDINAVIAN airline SAS has reported a fourth consecutive annual loss in 2011 and said it would accelerate a 
5bn Swedish crown (£473.3m) plan to cut costs and boost revenue.
The group, half-owned by Sweden, Norway and Denmark, has faced competitive pressure in its home Nordic 
markets from Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. A buoyant Norwegian recently placed a big aircraft order.
SAS chief executive Rickard Gustafson said the macro-economic outlook for the airline business remained tough.
"We foresee a continued weak economic development in Europe and that what we are seeing in the fourth quarter 
of 2011 will be what we can expect for 2012," he said yesterday.
Gustafson said the airline's latest restructuring plan, called 4Excellence, which aims to reduce unit costs by three to 
five per cent, would be accelerated this year and next.

Highlight: Low-cost airlines are emerging as the industry's winners, say Andrew Parker and Miles Johnson
Body
Europe's leading low-cost airlines are thriving in the economic downturn but the region's flag-carriers are finding it 
much tougher.
Amid the European Union's sovereign debt crisis, consumers and business people are saving money when 
travelling inside the European Union by flying with budget airlines rather than flag-carriers.
The outcome is manifesting itself in industry results. Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline by revenue, last 
week raised its profit forecast for 2011-12 from EUR440m to EUR480m. By contrast, Lufthansa, Europe's largest 
flag-carrier by revenue, issued a profit warning last September. Air France-KLM, the second-largest flag-carrier, 
said in November it expected to report an operating loss in 2011.
Furthermore, the low-cost carriers are well-placed to exploit the collapse of some of Europe's state-backed airlines.
Ryanair on Friday announced it would open an operating base in Budapest - just hours after Malev Hungarian 
Airlines, Hungary's flag-carrier, ceased operations because its finances had become unviable .
Ryanair was able to pounce after grounding 80 aircraft this winter in response to high fuel prices, and the Irish 
airline is putting four Boeing 737 jets into Budapest.
"Grounding 80 aircraft this winter has provided Ryanair with the rapid response unit that can exploit market 
openings like this," says Joe Gill, analyst at Bloxham.
Ryanair is also considering expanding services in Barcelona after the collapse this month of Spanair, a carrier 
based in Catalonia's regional capital. Spanair ceased flying after failing to secure funds from the Catalonian 
administration .
Analysts predict more airline failures in Europe because there are simply too many carriers.
Europe's flag-carriers take a dive News analysis
Most forecast Europe will be left with three large flag-carriers - Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and International Airlines 
Group, owner of British Airways and Iberia. However, analysts are divided on whether Norwegian Air Shuttle, which 
last month placed an order for 222 aircraft , can join Ryanair and EasyJet in the top tier of European low-cost 
carriers.
A combination of the deteriorating economic environment and high fuel prices is undermining some airlines. In the 
past, flag-carriers might have expected bail-outs from governments, but the Malev and Spanair cases show that 
budget-constrained administrations do not necessarily have the funds.
Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, envisages a combination of airline collapses and industry 
consolidation after estimating that 21 of Europe's top 40 airlines had a market share of less than 1 per cent in 2011 
when measured by the number of seats they provide on the region's short-haul routes.
He highlights how the top five airlines in the US - Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United-Continental, American 
Airlines and US Airways - controlled 86 per cent of domestic seating capacity in 2011. By contrast, the top five in 
Europe - Lufthansa, Ryanair, Air France-KLM, EasyJet and IAG - controlled just 45 per cent of intra-EU capacity.
Mr van Klaveren says Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG will survive because they have profitable long-haul 
networks.
"All of [Europe's] second-tier legacy airlines are at risk," he adds. "It is quite difficult to see how they will be viable in 
the long term."
Some second-tier carriers with a niche role may survive by combining with one of the three big groups.
For example, IAG is interested in buying Transportes Aereos Portugeses , the Portuguese flag-carrier that is due to 
be privatised, because it has a strong long-haul network to Brazil.
"[European flag-carriers] that do not have strategic relevance like Malev will be under extreme pressure," says 
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland.

Highlight: Bjorn Kjos is taking on SAS in a bid to dominate the northern European airline sector, writes Michael 
Stothard
Body
The trick to dog fighting in a Starfighter supersonic jet was to fly high above the clouds and then dive down on your 
enemy at speed, according to Bjorn Kjos (below), the chief executive and co-founder of Norwegian Air Shuttle.
Mr Kjos retired from the Norwegian air force in the mid-1970s but, from his sleek Oslo office, he is still doing 
business using the tactics he learnt there. The key difference now is that he has rival airlines, rather than enemy 
fighter aircraft, in his crosshairs.
Last month, Mr Kjos pulled the trigger on one of the biggest aircraft orders in European aviation history , 
announcing plans to buy 222 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus worth $22bn at list price.
The move will triple the number of aircraft available to the midsized low-cost carrier over the next eight years from 
62 to as many as 200, presenting a direct challenge to SAS, the dominant airline in Scandinavia, which has 
struggled to turn a full-year profit since 2007.
"We will have the dominance of the northern sector of Europe," says Mr Kjos, leaving no doubt who he thinks would 
come out on top should, as analysts argue, the Scandinavian market not be able to sustain both SAS and the 
expanded Norwegian Air.
Mr Kjos, who is a former paratrooper, lawyer, judge, pilot and author of a spy thriller, said that the new Boeing 737s, 
737-800s and Airbus 320s will make Norwegian 11-15 per cent more fuel efficient, allowing the company to fly for 
less than half of what it costs rival SAS.
He adds that the aviation industry is entering a new era where it will be "absolutely impossible" to compete while 
flying old aircraft because of the high cost of fuel. There will be "a change in the players" in European aviation and 
more bankruptcies , he predicts.
Norwegian airline chief bets $22bn on dogfight News analysis
SAS is not the only rival Norwegian will encounter as it rolls out its ambitious expansion plans. Ryanair, the leading 
low-cost carrier in Europe, has highlighted Scandinavia as a key growth target in the coming years and has even 
threatened to run some domestic flights.
But Mr Kjos is confident that Norwegian can defeat Ryanair as well. "We will not have any problems competing with 
Ryanair" in the Nordic region, he says. "Scandinavians are conservative and want to stick with the airlines they 
know."
Ryanair will also struggle to secure the "crucial business customer" because it flies from secondary airports and 
offers a worse experience in some respects, he says.
"We have better leg room, reclining seats, and WiFi on all the new aeroplanes."
The 220 new orders will put Norwegian in the same league as Ryanair and EasyJet, which operate 275 and 196 
aircraft respectively. Norwegian has no plans to compete with them on central European routes, however.
Analysts are concerned about the size of the $22bn order for a medium-sized business which made pre-tax profits 
of just NKr243m ($41m) on revenues of NKr8.6bn in 2010.
Norwegian already has net debt of Nkr2.5bn after placing big orders in 2007, which is only slightly short of its 
Nkr2.7bn market capitalisation.
The company says that 85 per cent of the money for each new aircraft will be backed by the Export-Import Bank of 
the US and by European export credit agencies, lowering its interest rates considerably.
The other 15 per cent will have to be provided by the company from existing operations and selling old aircraft.
Norwegian will keep the new aircraft for six to eight years, says Mr Kjos, and sell them on, hoping that the initial 
discount they received on the order means that they will not lose too much money on the resale.
Another source for concern is Norwegian's proposed long-haul operation expansion plan, which will focus on the 
growing market in China.
"Norwegian already has a bit of a stretched balance sheet and this move into long haul means more capital 
expenditure," says Lars-Tore Turtveit, analyst at SEB Enskilda.
But Mr Kjos, who owns 27 per cent of Norwegian Air, says that costs will be driven down by flying direct to major 
hubs, including Bangkok and New York, and by using existing infrastructure and foreign crews as much as possible.
The story of Norwegian Air Shuttle started in 1993 when Mr Kjos and some pilot friends took over the remains of 
bankrupt local carrier Busy Bee. Throughout the 1990s it ran flights in Norway on contract from Braathens, which 
was then the county's dominant carrier.
But in 2001 Braathens was bought by SAS, which cancelled its contract with Norwegian and forced the smaller 
carrier to compete directly with SAS or go under.
"I think they [SAS] regret it now, or at least they should," says Mr Kjos, chuckling.

Ad2One Ireland set to market CityJet ad platform
Ad2One Ireland set to market CityJet ad platform
Sunday Business Post

Digital sales agency Ad2One Ireland has been appointed to market a new online advertising platform by European 
regional airline CityJet. This will allow Irish and global brands to reach the airline's customer base by placing ads on 
its website, e-tickets and boarding cards.
The Irish arm of the agency will market and sell the advertising package to direct advertisers, as well as agencies. 
Ad2One devised a one-month deal, offering advertising on all online display by CityJet and as part of the airline's 
emails -- it sends three per month to its subscriber base. Robert Quirke, managing director of Ad2One in Ireland, 
said that the agency would be quite selective when it came to advertisers with an interest in the package.
"We're looking for marquee brands, for sure. There are very few advertising solutions that allow you to engage with 
the customer at every touchpoint -- from the CityJet website, to its e-tickets and its boarding cards -- but this is one 
of those," said Quirke. "It's a monthly takeover, and you're getting extremely good exposure for nothing -- EUR 
10,000, EUR 11,000 per month. It's a very competitive package."
Although Ad2One has worked with Ryanair, Quirke said that it hadn't come up with an advertising plan of this 
nature before.
"The proposition we put forward to CityJet was quite different to what we have with Ryanair -- which is specifically 
targeted at the Irish market. CityJet required the drafting of a brand new proposal that covered both Ireland and 
Europe," he said.
The affluent, 'top-end' traveller was the most likely to choose CityJet's service, said Quirke.
"The tastes and interests of its business clientele will be central to the work that we at Ad2One do for the airline. 
Our advertising solution offers an excellent opportunity for brand association, and a chance to work with a premium, 
prestige brand like CityJet to the appropriate advertiser, the first of which is Volvo."
Quirke said that CityJet advertising was never going to be based on numbers of page impressions.
Ad2One Ireland set to market CityJet ad platform
"It's about association, it's about an all-round presence. We're combining digital advertising with display advertising 
and more traditional tangible ads."
This is the first time that CityJet has offered advertising on these platforms.
"The airline never had any advertising before," said Quirke, "and that's part of my goal with Ad2One -- to come up 
with new propositions and ideas for the right kind of companies. Rather than squabbling over the existing market, 
we try to come up with intelligent solutions and create new revenue streams, increasing the size of the available 
pot," he said.
"We're excited to work with Ad2One to help us both enhance the customer experience by providing them with 
targeted, premium brands that fit their profile," said Christine Ourmières, chief executive of CityJet.
"As well as that, it will help us boost our revenue as a company. This represents a winning partnership for everyone 
involved."

Mark Matanes has been general manager of Eden Restaurant in Dublin's Temple Bar since November 2010. 
Established in 1996, Eden has 26 staff. Matanes joined the restaurant in 2005.
.....
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
I have a lot of responsibilities. These include looking after everything from sales and operations, marketing and 
strategic planning to customer relations, staff and accounts and keeping an eye on trends.
**What are your professional motivators?**
I am motivated every day by my belief that our product is one of the best in our market. We offer locally sourced, 
seasonal, Irish ingredients in our bistro menu that takes influence from across Europe for lunch and dinner seven 
days a week. I believe that we must continue to find new innovative ways to cater to our customers in line with their 
needs.
I am also driven by the notion that good food doesn't have to fit the constraints of a certain label. By taking things in 
new directions that uphold our ethos, we can help create experiences that become memories.
**How would you describe your work style?**
My work style is hands-on, communicative and approachable.
**What rates as your best business decision?**
Changing the delivery method of the product. In 2011, we introduced a EUR 10 Express Lunch Menu, alongside our 
traditional set course option. We also merged our A La Carte Dinner Menu with our Pre-Theatre Early Bird to offer 
one dinner menu. The idea was to extend more value to our customers for the same high level of quality.
Working Week: Mark Matanes
**What is the most valuable professional lesson you have learned?**
It's not what you want for the customer, it's what they want for themselves; under-promise and over-deliver; and 
'marketing, it's the business'.
**Who do you most admire in Irish business?**
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair. Love him or hate him, you will invariably end up talking about him and, 
in turn, his company. He competes successfully and consistently in a difficult industry, all the while manipulating the 
media. You can always count on his ability to cause a stir.
**What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?**
I expect to see a lot of creativity and resolve in the months ahead. I think that emerging market gaps in my sector 
will be filled by those willing to step enthusiastically forward with unconventional approaches. It's time to embrace 
adaptation without sacrificing identity.
**What is your ultimate professional goal?**
It is to gain enough trust and exposure in my ability to lead a business that I can become an ambassador for the 
tourism and hospitality sector. I want to work with different products and businesses in a consultative role.

European independent airlines feel the squeeze from both ends
European independent airlines feel the squeeze from both ends

In 2004, Michael O'Leary predicted a bloodbath in European aviation. Last week saw the latest chapter in that 
massacre as Malev, founded in 1946, collapsed just days after Spanair went out of business.Predictably, O'Leary's 
Ryanair was, with ruthless efficiency, in Budapest to announce a host of new routes just hours after Malev's 
demise.
But Ryanair is not the only beneficiary of the slow death of Europe's remaining legacy carriers. At one end of the 
market, the huge network airlines - Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and Willie Walsh's IAG -- continue to expand, while 
at the other end, low-cost carriers such as Ryanair, Easyjet and Norwegian, which ordered 200 new aircraft last 
week, heap pressure on the last remaining independent carriers caught in the middle.
"This is the time of year when airlines usually go bust," said Davy analyst Stephen Furlong. "But people under-
estimate just how big the news about Spanair and Malev is. It is rare that airlines of that size just go out of business. 
For two to go in a short period indicates the massive turmoil in the sector at the moment."  
Apart from relentless competition, European airlines face poor economic conditions and huge cost pressures, not 
least in terms of oil.
German aviation expert Heinrich Grossbongardt believes that all airlines caught between the low-cost carriers and 
the major network airlines are endangered.
"The prospects for the smaller airlines are bleak," he said. "The old flag carriers of the smaller countries have 
already failed or will not be able to survive. Aviation today is a commodity business with economies of scale the 
most important factor. Smaller airlines with a home market of 10 or 20 million people cannot compete."  
He sees more airlines going bust rather than being bought out by bigger rivals. He points to the example of 
Lufthansa. Its acquisition of Swiss in 2005 proved very successful. But its more recent acquisition of Austrian 
Airlines has been much more problematic, even though the Austrian government cleared its EUR 500 million debt in 
advance. That lesson will have been noted by other prospective buyers of ailing European aviation assets.
European independent airlines feel the squeeze from both ends
Such an analysis would appear to paint a very bleak picture for Aer Lingus. The government is trying at present to 
sell its 25 per cent stake in the airline. But Grossbongardt believes that a combination of very strong brands and 
home markets with above average travel demands puts Aer Lingus -- as well as Scandinavia- based SAS and 
Poland's LOT - in a different position from others. Keith McMullan of London company Aviation Economics agrees 
that Aer Lingus is a different case from Malev or Spanair, whose failures didn't surprise him..
"There is no reason why a small niche regional airline cannot succeed," he said. "Can you draw any implications for 
the future of Aer Lingus from what happened to Malev and Spanair? Absolutely not. Aer Lingus has a strong 
balance sheet, a reasonable intra-European network and has expanded on perfectly viable long-haul routes."
There has been speculation that this makes Aer Lingus an ideal target for the major Middle Eastern airlines which 
have not hidden their interest in Europe. Aircraft orders for this decade will triple the size of Etihad, Emirates and 
Qatar Airways, and they will be about 30 per cent larger than the combined wide-bodied fleets of Air France/KLM, 
Lufthansa and IAG. Indeed, the size of their fleet orders alone makes it imperative that they suck in passengers 
from every market they can, with acquisitions one strategy for achieving this.
"It is very clear that Etihad sniffed around different airlines and came up with Air Berlin, not Aer Lingus," said 
Furlong of the Abu Dhabi-based airline's acquisition of the German carrier. "It doesn't preclude Aer Lingus from a 
future deal. Qatar is clearly looking at other airlines and could look at Aer Lingus but, with both Etihad and Emirates 
in Dublin, it does not appear straightforward."  
McMullan agrees that Aer Lingus and Virgin Airlines are two of the airlines that could be rescued from Europe's 
bloodbath by Middle Eastern benefactors. But with rules about majority ownership of airlines staying in European 
hands, he is not convinced that such deals will come to fruition.
"It might not be Aer Lingus that the Middle Eastern airlines are after, it might be Dublin Airport itself," he said.

Highlight: Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, today said that it is to set up a base in Hungary's capital, Budapest, just 
hours after national carrier, Malev, said it was grounding all flights after running out of cash.
Body
Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, today said that it is to set up a base in Hungary's capital, Budapest, just hours after 
national carrier, Malev, said it was grounding all flights after running out of cash.
Malev ceased operating early today, ending 66 years of almost continuous service, after its planes were held 
overseas for unpaid debts.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban told Kossuth radio that the decision to ground Malev, which was placed under creditor 
protection earlier in the week, was made after two aircraft were not allowed to take off from Tel Aviv and Ireland.
In a December white paper, the government said the potential loss of the airline, which spent about 50 million euros 
a year on air service charges and real estate fees, could jeopardise the operation of Budapest Airport. The airline 
accounts for 40 percent of turnover at the airport, owned by Germany's Hochtief and four financial partners. Ryanair 
today confirmed that it will base 4 brand new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft at Budapest Airport commencing in just 
two weeks' time on Friday 17th February where it will open 31 new routes, delivering up to 2m passengers a year 
and replacing most of the traffic and routes lost by Budapest following the grounding of Malev. Ryanair, which 
currently employs over 700 Hungarian pilots and cabin crew, will be holding an open recruitment day in Budapest 
on Tuesday next (7th Feb), inviting job applications from Malev pilots, cabin crew and engineers, it said. The 
International Airport Council figures confirm that this 2m pax p.a. will support 2,000 jobs at Budapest Airport, 
Ryanair said. This largest ever investment in Hungarian aviation and tourism is subject to reaching final agreement 
with Budapest Airport today on costs, facilities and handling, and Ryanair's Deputy CEO Michael Cawley has 
travelled to Budapest to finalise these negotiations with Budapest Airport and the Hungarian Government. Because 
Ryanair has grounded up to 80 aircraft this winter, it has the capacity to respond immediately to the Malev 
grounding by moving aircraft, pilots and crews to Budapest within two weeks, in order to minimise the disruption to 
Hungarian consumers/visitors and tourism as a result of the Malev closure, he said.

The ISEQ closed a week of steady gains on a high, breaking the 3,100 level for the first time in nearly 18 months as 
fears of catastrophe in Europe faded and the US showed real signs of a rebound.
The index rose 69.50 points to 3,135.32.
European shares surged past a resistance level after U.S. jobs figures data beat expectations, raising optimism that 
the world's largest economy was on track for a recovery. U.S. non-farm payrolls rose at their fastest pace in nine 
months and the unemployment rate dropped to a near three-year low, boosting prospects for stronger economic 
growth that could feed through into company earnings.
Average daily turnover in Irish equities fell slightly from E133m to E131m in the fourth quarter, the Irish Stock 
Exchange (ISE) said. Overall turnover fell from E8.8bn to E8.2bn in the fourth quarter (Q4) reflecting the fall in the 
number of days in the period (63 days compared to 66 days in Q3). Trade levels in equities showed an increase of 
14.2pc in 2011 with total trades exceeding 2.4m for the year (2010: 2.1m). The average number of trades per day 
remained steady at over 10,000 in the last quarter of 2011 (10,132 in Q4 compared to 10,367 in Q3). Market 
capitalisation of companies included in the ISEQ indices rose by more E20bn during the quarter reaching E86.9bn 
at the end of December 2011, an increase of 32.1pc in Q4 and 80.7pc over the calendar year. The world's biggest 
cement firm, Cemex has reported fourth quarter 2011 EBITDA (core earnings) of dollar 542m, comfortably ahead of

The ISEQ closed a week of steady gains on a high, breaking the 3,100 level for the first time in nearly 18 months as 
fears of catastrophe in Europe faded and the US showed real signs of a rebound.
The index rose 69.50 points to 3,135.32.
European shares surged past a resistance level after U.S. jobs figures data beat expectations, raising optimism that 
the world's largest economy was on track for a recovery. U.S. non-farm payrolls rose at their fastest pace in nine 
months and the unemployment rate dropped to a near three-year low, boosting prospects for stronger economic 
growth that could feed through into company earnings.
Average daily turnover in Irish equities fell slightly from E133m to E131m in the fourth quarter, the Irish Stock 
Exchange (ISE) said. Overall turnover fell from E8.8bn to E8.2bn in the fourth quarter (Q4) reflecting the fall in the 
number of days in the period (63 days compared to 66 days in Q3). Trade levels in equities showed an increase of 
14.2pc in 2011 with total trades exceeding 2.4m for the year (2010: 2.1m). The average number of trades per day 
remained steady at over 10,000 in the last quarter of 2011 (10,132 in Q4 compared to 10,367 in Q3). Market 
capitalisation of companies included in the ISEQ indices rose by more E20bn during the quarter reaching E86.9bn 
at the end of December 2011, an increase of 32.1pc in Q4 and 80.7pc over the calendar year. The world's biggest 
cement firm, Cemex has reported fourth quarter 2011 EBITDA (core earnings) of dollar 542m, comfortably ahead of 
both the Davy estimate of dollar 515m and consensus of dollar 525m. Fourth quarter 2011 sales rose 6.0pc year-
on-year (yoy) with EBITDA up 13pc yoy. EBITDA margins increased by 90bps yoy. Its peer, Ireland's CRH, saw 
shares climb 45c to E15.78. Readymix shares were flat at E0.19 after it warned that profits will fall sharply in the full 
year 2011 as it takes on a E39m impairment charge. Ryanair said that it carried 6pc less passengers last month 
than it did in January of 2011 as it cut capacity. It carried 4.39 million passengers in the month compared to 4.66 
million the same time last year. Meanwhile, it said it has stepped in to fill up the vacuum left by the grounding of

aircraft it sidelined because of high fuel costs. Shares in the airline rose 9c to E4.35. Aer Lingus was flat at E0.89.

No-frills airline, Ryanair, today said that it carried 6pc less passengers last month than it did in January of 2011 as it 
cut capacity.
It carried 4.39 million passengers in the month compared to 4.66 million the same time last year.
"As previously guided, Ryanair's 2011/12 winter traffic was expected to decline by around 5pc as we sit up to 80 
aircraft on the ground due to higher oil prices," said airline spokesman, Stephen McNamara.
Ryanair carried 76.2 million passengers in the twelve months to the end of January, it said. Its load factor - an 
industry-wide measure of how well airlines fill their aircraft - was unmoved at 71pc in January on the year and came 
in at 82pc for the 12 months to the end of last month, it said.

Body
Ryanair today said it planned to take legal action to prevent rival Aer Lingus, in which it owns a near 30pc stake, 
from topping up a pension scheme deficit of at least 400 million euros.
Ryanair, Aer Lingus's largest shareholder, has repeatedly called on the former flag-carrier to say it will not 
contribute to the pension fund if it is not legally obliged to.
Aer Lingus had said on Monday it was in talks with unions over how to fill the hole in its pension scheme, the size of 
which, analysts say, has scared off potential buyers of the government's 25 percent stake.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said that without a statement from Aer Lingus that no further contributions 
would be made over and above the current fixed rate of 6.375 percent, his company would pursue legal action. 
"Ryanair fears that (Monday's) statement indicates that the board of Aer Lingus may be considering resiling from 
the assurances that (it) has no obligation to make additional contributions," Michael O'Leary said in an open letter to 
Aer Lingus shareholders published today.

(RTTNews) - Ryanair plc (RYA.L, RYAAY.L) reported Friday a letter from its chief executive Michael O'Leary, which 
threatened legal action against Aer Lingus plc (AERL.L) in the event that Aer Lingus made any additional, 
"unnecessary", contributions to its pension scheme without prior shareholder approval. The letter expressed 
concern over Aer Lingus's statement of January 30, 2012 seeking to address a funding shortfall in the IASS.
Further, "repeated" prior requests that Aer Lingus convene an EGM and also adopt a resolution affirming that no 
additional payments to the defined contribution pension scheme would be made were ignored, Ryanair said. Such 
contributions, the missive added, might be seen as more "frittering away" of shareholder funds.

AIRPORT operator BAA must sell London Stansted airport, after losing an appeal against an earlier order by the 
Competition Commission.
But BAA has not ruled out appealing further, in the latest twist in a three-year fight between the firm and the 
Competition Commission over its dominance of the UK airport market.
"We are disappointed by the decision of the Competition Appeal Tribunal which we will now carefully consider 
before making any further statements," BAA said.
Last year the commission ordered BAA to sell one of its Scottish airports before it disposes of Stansted.
BAA, owned by Spanish infrastructure group Ferrovial, put Edinburgh airport up for sale in October, but asked for a 
judicial review of the latest ruling on Stansted.
"Whilst BAA is of course entitled to explore the available avenues for challenge, it is now surely time for BAA to 
accept our findings and proceed with the necessary divestments," said Laura Carstensen, a member of the original 
inquiry.
Ryanair, which operates most of its London flights out of Stansted and has long lobbied for a break-up of BAA's 
airports, welcomed the decision and called for the "urgent sale" of the site.

Malev liquidation begins

Highlight: CFO does not rule out a new, smaller Hungarian airline as low-cost-carriers ramp up capacity in 
Budapest.
Body
The liquidation of Hungarian flag carrier Malev began on Monday February 14. The airline's assets will be sold to 
indemnify creditors and the carrier's entire staff of 1,060 will be made redundant.
Malev stopped operating on February 3 after two of its aircraft were seized by airport authorities in Dublin and Tel 
Aviv. Service providers lost faith in the airline's ability to meet payments after the EU Comission ordered Malev to 
pay back almost Eur 300 million in illegal state subsidies to the Hungarian government in January.
Over the next two months, Tamas Pergel, Malev's chief financial officer, has the responsibility of closing the 
balance sheet, finalizing the results for 2011 and taking a stock count of the airline.
Fleet returned to lessors
Malev operated a fleet of 18 Boeing 737NGs leased mostly from International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) 
and four Q400s leased from Scandinavian Airlines (SAS).
ILFC has repossessed all of its 17 737NGs by flying them to Shannon airport in Ireland, apart from two aircraft 
which are grounded in Tel Aviv and Dublin. One aircraft is still in Hungary on a C check. This aircraft will be 
returned to ILFC on February 17. Pergel says he assumes there are no plans to return the repossessed 737NGs to 
Hungary.
The 737NG in Tel Aviv is still grounded. Malev owes money to Tel Aviv airport, but the airline is not allowed to pay 
because it has been granted a special creditor-protected status by the Hungarian government.
Two of the Q400s leased from SAS have been redelivered to the Scandinavian carrier. A third Q400 is having an 
engine overhaul, and fourth is on a C check in Hungary.
Creditors
Malev liquidation begins
The Hungarian government, which owns 95% of the Malev, will bear most of the cost of the airline's failure. Russia's 
state development bank, Vnesheconombank has a less than 5% stake in Malev. Malev also has an outstanding 
loan of Eur 120 million ($156 million) with the Russian bank.
Pergel says under normal circumstances Vnesheconombank would have no rights in a bankruptcy situation - both 
the loan and the bank's stake should be written off. However, he says the result might be settled diplomatically 
between Hungary and Russia.
New Hungarian carrier
While there is no future for Malev, Pergel does not rule out a new, much smaller carrier in Hungary.
"Whizzair and Ryanair were quick to react after Malev stopped operations by announcing more capacity and routes 
from Budapest, so the market for any Malev successor is very limited," says Pergel.
On the same day Malev was grounded, Ryanair said that it would open up 31 new routes from Budapest Airport 
from February 17, employing four new 737-800s. The Irish low-cost-carrier said it hoped to capture two million 
passengers a year from its Budapest operation.
Malev captured about 3 million to 3.5 million passengers a year, and any new airline might reach about 1 million to 
1.5 million, according to Pergel. A new airline might cover Eastern Europe and some Mediterranean destinations 
with a capacity of 10 to 12 aircraft, he says.
Many institutions could fund a new airline, but it would take at least Eur 50 million to 100 million to start again from 
scratch, says Pergel.

Body
ONE of the City's best-known fund managers has launched a campaign against fees in the investment industry, 
arguing that customers have been "ripped off" for too long.
Alan Miller, who recently founded low-cost fund manager SCM, said investors faced a "minefield of charges" and 
were being left "seriously out of pocket" when it came to their investments and pension.
As a remedy, Miller yesterday launched a "true and far code and labelling scheme", which will allow investors to 
compare investment products on a like-for-like basis.
Earlier this week Gary Shaughnessy, the UK managing director of Fidelity, also called for greater transparency, 
warning that some "low cost" funds were copying Ryanair by using "selective and partial" pricing to hide their true 
cost. Yesterday, Shaughnessy told City A.M. he thought greater transparency would prove that most funds were not 
ripping off customers.
"Its not about putting out large numbers, its more about getting things done. Generally speaking we should want 
more people to invest in fund to save for their retirement," he said. FORUM: P20

after agreement was reached on the Fiscal Pact last night among EU leaders.

European stocks were higher around midday, reversing a sharp two-day slide and resuming their six-week rally on 
renewed hopes for a Greek debt deal, and as investors cheered the approval of a new euro zone budget discipline 
pact. Gains were capped, however, by mounting tension surrounding Portugal's debt troubles, with the country's 
two-year bond yields hitting a euro-era record above 21 percent.
Shares in Ryanair were flat at E4.19 after the airline upped its earnings forecast on Monday. Analysts reevaluated

E467m (31.5c) and E474m (32c) respectively. This broadly follows Ryanair's guidance of E480m net income for 
2012. "With the tough fuel comparable, we assume losses of E73m in Q4 2012 and Ryanair will also have to deal 
with a E350m fuel headwind (c.E3.5 per passenger) in 2013. We expect this to be broadly passed through with the

The ISEQ rose back above the 3,000 level again today in a subdued rebound in line with the rest of Europe after 
agreement was reached on the Fiscal Pact Monday night among EU leaders.
The index climbed 18.07 points to 3,007.79.
European stocks rose on renewed hopes for a Greek debt deal, though gains were capped by weaker-than-
expected U.S. data that cast doubt on the strength of the world's biggest economy. Near-bankrupt Greece struggled 
on with its foreign lenders to show them it can ram through spending cuts and labour reform in exchange for a 
crucial debt swap deal and a 130 billion euro bailout package needed to avoid an unruly default.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1c at E4.18 after the airline upped its earnings forecast on Monday. Analysts 
reevaluated their pricing this morning. After increasing forecasts by over 5pc earlier in the month, Davy are raising 
thier forecasts by 4pc to net income of E485.4m (EPS of 32.7c) in 2012 and to E487.2m (EPS 33.2c) in 2013 from 
E467m (31.5c) and E474m (32c) respectively. This broadly follows Ryanair's guidance of E480m net income for 
2012. "With the tough fuel comparable, we assume losses of E73m in Q4 2012 and Ryanair will also have to deal 
with a E350m fuel headwind (around E3.5 per passenger) in 2013. We expect this to be broadly passed through 
with the help of bag charges, assigned seating, competitive weakness (for example Spanair, tour operators etc) and 
high competitor fares. We assume 6pc yield growth and 2pc per passenger ancillary growth for 5.1pc unit per 
passenger revenue growth (increased charges and ancillary revenue initiatives should account for at least two-
thirds of the revenue increase). We also assume a relatively benign ex-fuel cost pressure (up just 1pc)." Aer Lingus 
stocks rose 2c to E0.87. The airline has confirmed that it is in discussions with parties involved in the IASS under 
the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission (LRC). These parties include trade unions representing Aer 
Lingus members of the IASS as well as Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) and trade union representatives of DAA staff. 
These discussions follow on from meetings held in 2011, which were also facilitated by the LRC. Shares in Kerry

Group rose 39c to E28.09, Aryzta fell 64c to E35.07 and C and C was unmoved at E3.14. European beverage 
stocks outperformed the E300 in the past week and are up 4.4pc year-to-date (ytd) versus the E300 (+5.3pc). 
However, in the US, beverages are -1.8pc ytd versus the S and P 500 (+4pc) after another week of 
underperformance. Food producers continued to underperform the E300 in the past week, down 0.5pc on an 
absolute basis, and remained in negative territory for the year (-0.3pc). In the US, food products declined in 
absolute terms by 0.8pc but remain in positive territory for the year (+0.3pc). Elsewhere, CRH rose 15c to E15.14,

Lufthansa trains cadets in Arizona

European airlines differ in their approaches to managing flightcrew, taking varying degrees of active involvement in 
initial training. What seems to unite them, however, is that they tactically plan their demand for cockpit personnel 
only a few years in advance. There is no clear, long-term industry standard on how the next pilot generation will be 
trained to command the large fleet in the manufacturers' orderbooks.
Boeing forecasts 92,500 pilots will be required in Europe during the next 20 years. Asia Pacific will need 183,200, 
with China accounting for 72,200 alone. North America is expected to require 82,800 pilots, Latin America 41,200, 
the Middle East 36,600, Africa 14,300, and the CIS 9,900 until 2030. These figures sum to about 460,000 in total.
While the aircraft backlog continues to increase in spite of shorter and more erratic economic cycles, there is 
widespread concern over whether pilot-training academies have kept pace with airline growth and can deliver

enough new flightcrew with the required capabilities. British Airways changed its pilot recruitment strategy last 
August after it foresaw a potential flightcrew shortage. The UK carrier wants to employ about 800 pilots during the 
next five years. While it needs about 100 new employees per year to maintain its approximately 3,200-strong 
cockpit workforce, BA wants to employ 150 flightcrew members every year for growth. Half of these recruits should 
come via direct entry from other airlines and the military, while the other half will be career starters from ab initio 
level. This is BA's biggest pilot recruitment initiative in more than a decade.
The main difference lies in the renewed interest in ab initio students. BA employed fresh air transport pilot licence 
(ATPL) holders before, but those graduates had undertaken and financed their training independently and were 
hired from the open market after qualification. Self-funded training has become the main route into a cockpit for 
aspiring pilots since 2001, says Anthony Petteford, managing director for ab initio training at Oxford Aviation 
Academy (OAA) in the UK.
Retail training
Airlines, including BA, previously pre-financed the training of a limited number of ab initio students after they had 
undergone an initial selection process, with the young pilots repaying the fees later during employment. This 
changed, however, with the aviation downturn after 9/11 and the concurrent rise of budget carriers such as EasyJet 
and Ryanair, which had always drawn cockpit personnel from the open pilot market. Petteford points out that the 
shift to this "retail" training model has moved control over cadet enrolment numbers from airlines to individuals.
BA still does not pay for the flight training in three selected academies, but now helps its students secure the 
required funding by guaranteeing a bank loan. Access to credit has become a main hurdle for pilot aspirants 
because of the financial crises since 2008, threatening to turn the profession into a career option mainly for children 
from sufficiently affluent backgrounds. BA worked with banks to devise a loan scheme because it feared the pool of 
applicants made of the right stuff was becoming too limited.
BA sister carrier Iberia is also recruiting a large number of flightcrew, although this will only be for its planned low-
cost subsidiary Iberia Express, due to begin operations with four Airbus A320s at the end of March, which will 
gradually take over the parent's short- and medium-haul network. While 125 pilots are needed for the start-up 
phase, this is set to increase as the new airline is scheduled to have 13 aircraft by year-end and 40 by 2015. Iberia 
has traditionally recruited qualified pilots from a military or civilian background.
A number of flightcrew will transfer to Iberia Express from the parent carrier, which will concentrate exclusively on 
long-haul flights. The latter's approximately 1,500-strong cockpit workforce will gradually move up the ranks and 
convert to the A330/A340 fleet as senior flightcrew members retire. However, Iberia has no plans to recruit new 
pilots for the mainline operations. Whether it will be possible for Iberia Express flightcrew to transfer to the parent 
carrier is as yet unclear.
Lufthansa expects to take on about 300 new pilots this year. The German airline mainly recruits ab initio cadets who 
learn their trade at the in-house training campuses in Bremen and Goodyear, Arizona. Only if demand exceeds the 
available supply of career starters does the airline fall back on direct-entry pilots.
Sponsorship
Unlike many of its European competitors, Lufthansa still sponsors the training of its cockpit staff, giving it complete 
control over the training quantity and quality. The selected students receive an interest-free loan from the airline of 
E60,000 ($77,000) to contribute to the training, which costs about E300,000 in total, says Lufthansa. The cadets are 
only responsible for their housing and living costs during the two-year training programme, and repay the loan later 
during employment.
Lufthansa's two Alpine subsidiaries - Austrian Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines - pursue the same 
paternalistic model. The former has stopped pilot recruitment for the time being because of restructuring. However, 
Swiss plans to employ 400 to 500 new pilots during the next five years, while about 100 are due to retire. The Swiss

carrier has capacity to qualify up to 100 ab initio students a year. This is done partly in-house and at its partner 
academies Flugschule Grenchen, near Berne, and FlightSafety in Vero Beach, Florida. Any demand beyond that 
will need to be satisfied via direct-entry pilots or by utilising training capacity of the parent group.
Ryanair's pilot recruitment strategy, on the other hand, is firmly based on the retail model and on aspirants taking 
their own initiative to earn their wings. Since the training is ­self­sponsored, the financial details are "not a question 
for Ryanair", says the Irish budget carrier.
As with other airlines, the students even pay for their type rating at the company's simulator centre at East Midlands 
Airport, UK, or CAE in Amsterdam. Free line training is provided to students "subject to certain conditions". 
Nevertheless, Ryanair says it has a backlog of "several thousand" applications from ATPL holders. Between April 
2012 and April 2013, the airline plans to take on between 400 and 450 pilots.
Petteford does not share the concern that the flight-training industry will be unable to supply required future pilot 
volumes. He says that while statistics have been predicting deficits between pilot demand and training capacity for 
almost two decades, the training industry has, so far, been able to provide the necessary pilots. "I have been in this 
business for 15 years, and I have never been in a situation where I could not supply [from the graduate pool]." He 
adds that, despite the financial crisis and associated credit access difficulties, application numbers for the 
academy's European airline pilot training programme have not fluctuated significantly during the past years. OAA 
qualifies 250 to 300 ATPL students a year and could easily increase capacity to 400, if there was sufficient market 
demand.
What is crucial, however, is that airlines support airline pilot training programmes at flight academies and continue 
to recruit their graduates, says Petteford. "My fear is that the day when airlines completely abdicate their 
responsibility of mentoring students [is the day when] we might see a different story."
PARTNERSHIPS
OAA is one of three pilot schools which BA is partnered with for its ab initio training programme. Similar co-
operations are in place with Aer Lingus, EasyJet and Flybe. The latter two have even established multi-crew pilot 
(MPL) licence programmes at the academy. The new airline pilot-training philosophy has shifted the balance from 
single pilots flying light aircraft to more airline-typical operations in simulators.
Not only is this type more relevant to modern airline operations in highly automated flightdecks, says Petteford, it 
would also be a way to increase training capacity because it is less dependent on external infrastructure, such as 
free airspace and adequately equipped airports for instrument approaches. So far, however, only about 10% of 
OAA's trainees are enrolled in MPL courses.
Such programmes can only be established in partnership with airlines because the training is tailored around the 
latter's individual standard operating procedures. If this is the way forward, however, it will require active 
participation and long-term commitment from the airlines.

You need to be grounded before you can fly. Low-cost carriers fare better than their full-service rivals in recessions, 
thanks partly to lower dependence on corporate travel and higher starting points for their margins. But a big part of 
the trick is managing capacity and, longer-term, being in the right place to pick up business as the industry shrinks.
Ryanair has been helping things along. It grounded 80 aircraft - almost 30 per cent of its fleet - this winter, with the 
result that its passenger traffic, year on year, fell by 2 per cent for the first time in its history. But this, in turn, helped 
the carrier push up its average fare by 17 per cent, to EUR40, in the third quarter to end-December . Revenue rose 
13 per cent, and, with costs (excluding fuel) well controlled, the airline made a EUR15m after-tax profit compared 
with expectations of a EUR16m loss. Full-year guidance goes up by 9 per cent, to EUR440m.
All those jets - plus another 12 deliveries - will be flying again over the summer. But Ryanair expects to repeat the 
grounding strategy next winter - which is lousy for second-home owners dependent on Ryanair schedules, but 
bullish for pricing. And in the meantime, the carrier looks well positioned to capitalise on industry shrinkage: 
Spanair's demise , for example, could offer opportunities out of Barcelona, and the clouds over BMIbaby's future let 
it entrench further in the UK's Midlands.
The extent to which shareholders benefit is another matter. Ryanair shares, trading on a forward earnings multiple 
of over 11 times, have doubled from 2008 lows but are no higher than in 2002. Increasing its share of intra-
European flights may, Ryanair predicts, permit longer-term annual growth of 4-5 per cent - respectable but hardly 
exciting. Still, there is talk of a buy-back programme and a second special dividend in 2013. For the airline 
business, at least, that's not bad.

Nevertheless, Ryanair says it has a backlog of "several thousand" applications from ATPL holders. Between April 
2012 and April 2013, the airline plans to take on between 400 and 450 pilots.
Features.
Petteford does not share the concern that the flight-training industry will be unable to supply required future pilot 
volumes. He says that while statistics have been predicting deficits between pilot demand and training capacity for 
almost two decades, the training industry has, so far, been able to provide the necessary pilots. "I have been in this 
business for 15 years, and I have never been in a situation where I could not supply [from the graduate pool]." He 
adds that, despite the financial crisis and associated credit access difficulties, application numbers for the 
academy's European airline pilot training programme have not fluctuated significantly during the past years. OAA 
qualifies 250 to 300 ATPL students a year and could easily increase capacity to 400, if there was sufficient market 
demand.
What is crucial, however, is that airlines support airline pilot training programmes at flight academies and continue 
to recruit their graduates, says Petteford. "My fear is that the day when airlines completely abdicate their 
responsibility of mentoring students [is the day when] we might see a different story."
PARTNERSHIPS
OAA is one of three pilot schools which BA is partnered with for its ab initio training programme. Similar co-
operations are in place with Aer Lingus, EasyJet and Flybe. The latter two have even established multi-crew pilot 
(MPL) licence programmes at the academy. The new airline pilot-training philosophy has shifted the balance from 
single pilots flying light aircraft to more airline-typical operations in simulators.
Not only is this type more relevant to modern airline operations in highly automated flightdecks, says Petteford, it 
would also be a way to increase training capacity because it is less dependent on external infrastructure, such as 
free airspace and adequately equipped airports for instrument approaches. So far, however, only about 10% of 
OAA's trainees are enrolled in MPL courses.
Such programmes can only be established in partnership with airlines because the training is tailored around the 
latter's individual standard operating procedures. If this is the way forward, however, it will require active 
participation and long-term commitment from the airlines.

RYANAIR yesterday raised its annual profit forecast, after a decision to ground 80 planes over winter paid off.
The budget airline said its traffic fell two per cent to 16.7m in the last three months of 2011, but higher revenues per 
passenger lifted turnover 13 per cent to (EURO)844m (£706m).
Ryanair's quarterly after-tax profit of (EURO)14.9m beat forecasts by analysts, many of whom had expected a loss.
Chief financial officer Howard Millar put the strong results down to "a benign winter" with low de-icing and 
cancellation costs, coupled with a 15 per cent rise in revenue per passenger to (EURO)51- a result of the capacity 
cut and a rise in customers paying to reserve seats.
Ryanair increased its full-year net profit forecast by nine per cent to (EURO)480m. The firm also plans to ask 
shareholders to approve a buyback of Nasdaq-listed ADRs, in addition to its plan to return up to (EURO)500m to 
shareholders by the end of next year. But Ryanair warned that its fuel costs will be (EURO)350m higher in 2012, 
despite being 90 per cent hedged.
Millar said the firm is planning to open new bases, and yesterday sent directors to Barcelona to look into collapsed 
Spanair's business.
He said talks are ongoing with Comac, the Chinese manufacturer, about ordering customised planes, after Ryanair 
failed to make a deal with Airbus. The planes, if ordered, could have wider doors - and fewer toilets - in order to fit 
200 seats.

Ryanair has claimed vindication of its decision to ground aircraft this winter, as it raised full-year profit guidance and 
outlined plans to return at least EUR500m to shareholders.
Europe's largest low-cost airline, which increased fares after grounding 80 aircraft in October, said yesterday it 
expected to generate a net profit of EUR480m in 2011-12, compared with previous guidance of EUR440m.
The Irish carrier paid a maiden dividend of EUR500m in 2010, and Howard Millar, finance director, said it was 
planning a similar pay-out during 2012.
He also held out the prospect of a share buy-back, saying Ryanair was seeking shareholder authorisation for the 
right to purchase some of its American depositary receipts.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, last year raised the possibility of a third special dividend during 2014 or 2015 in 
the absence of new aircraft orders, but Mr Millar said no decisions had been taken.
The shares closed up 0.96 per cent at EUR4.19.
Ryanair is benefiting from the economic downturn, as consumers switch to low-cost airlines. Mr Millar said the 
group should gain pricing power from consolidation and failures in the European airline industry, and noted the 
collapse of Span-air   on Friday.
"Fewer competitors is generally good for us," he said. "It will help with improving average fares." Ryanair reported 
an average fare of EUR40 in the third quarter of 2011-12, up 17 per cent from the period in 2010-11. The increase 
was largely made possible by the decision to cut seating capacity and offer fewer discounted fares.
Aircraft were grounded in response to high fuel prices. This winter is the first time it expects a decline in the number 
of passengers. It carried 16.7m passengers in the three months to December 31, down 2 per cent from the period in 
2010.
Ryanair lifts full-year profit forecast
Ryanair reported revenue of EUR844m in the third quarter, up 13 per cent year-on-year, and pre-tax profit of 
EUR15.5m, after a EUR12.7m loss during the same period in 2010.
Basic earnings per share were EUR1.02, compared with a loss of EUR0.69 a year ago. Profit was boosted by 
December's mild weather. In late 2010, the airline had to grapple with costs from the snowy conditions in Europe. 
Unit costs rose 11 per cent, mainly because of an 18 per cent increase in fuel charges.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Execution Noble, said Ryanair's strong revenue performance validated its decision to cut 
capacity.

The fragility of some of Europe's airlines was highlighted yesterday when Malev Hungarian Airlines, the state-
controlled Hungarian flag-carrier, declared that its finances were "unviable".
The Hungarian government is preparing to restructure Malev after designating it a strategically important asset.
But the airline's predicament underlined the rising pressure on some European carriers as they grapple with a 
deteriorating economic environment, high fuel prices and intensifying competition.
Spanair, the Spanish airline, is preparing for insolvency after the Catalan regional government, its controlling 
shareholder, refused to provide it with more funding .
Analysts warned of further airline failures after Spanair suspended operations on Saturday.
"We would highlight that a similar risk remains with a number of other state carriers, notably in central and eastern 
Europe, with further consolidation and potentially further failures very much on the cards," said Eamonn Hughes, 
analyst at Goodbody.
The European market is concentrating around five large airlines - Air France-KLM, International Airlines Group, 
Lufthansa, EasyJet and Ryanair - said Howard Millar, finance director at the Irish low-cost carrier.
Lorant Limburger, Malev's chief executive, told a board meeting yesterday that "despite the continually improving 
commercial results, the financing of activities had become unviable and was unresolved from the end of January", 
according to a statement by the airline.
It added that the board had instructed management "to draw up - by the end of the week - a new liquidity plan".
In its latest available set of accounts, for 2010, Malev recorded a net loss of Ft24.6bn ($126m). The carrier employs 
2,600 staff and has a fleet of 22 aircraft.
Pressure shows on Europe's frail airlines
The European Commission concluded this month that Malev had benefited from illegal state aid, and ordered the 
Hungarian government to recover an unspecified amount of funding provided to the carrier between 2007 and 2010.
The Hungarian ministry of national development responded by saying it would do its best "to sustain the airline's 
uninterrupted operation", adding that discussions with a "strategic investor" were in progress.
Efforts to save Spanair foundered partly because the Catalan government failed to persuade Qatar Airways, the 
Gulf carrier, to invest in the airline.
SAS, the struggling Scandinavian carrier that has an 11 per cent stake in Spanair, said yesterday that it expected to 
report a pre-tax loss for 2011 because the Spanish airline was filing for bankruptcy.
Previously, SAS had forecast a "marginally positive" pre-tax profit. Shares in SAS closed down almost 5 per cent.

Alan Miller (pictured) co-founder of wealth manager SCM Private, is calling for a 'complete overhaul' of the UK 
investment management industry, urging greater transparency over charges and where money is invested.
Miller, former Wealth Managercover star,has been one of the most vocal critics of thefunds industrysince he quit 
New Starin 2007and turned hisback on traditional active fund management with the launch of his ETF boutique 
SCM.
He launched the firm with a vowto 'revolutionise' the funds profession, while making a number of stinging attacks on 
theindustry, sayingthe majorityof funds were nothing more than 'closet index trackers'anddescribed the star fund 
manager culture as flawed and outdated. His outspoken comments attractedtheir fair share of criticism.
Miller'snewcampaign against the funds industrycomes a day after Fidelity warned about the emergence of'Ryanair' 
fund pricing and outlined its own pricing structure.
To drive this push for transparency,SCM is launching a True and Fair Code and Labelling Scheme, allowing 
investors, for the first time, to compare investment products and providers with a clear breakdown of costs and fees.
Miller saidthe new code will provide 100% transparency by showing the whole range of fees and the resulting all-
cost for investment, which will be known as the Total Cost of Investment (TCI).
The TCI will allow investors to make informed comparisons and decisions on different investment products including 
ISAs, pensions, unit trusts, exchange traded funds, hedge funds, investment trusts or any other investment product. 
Miller says it will also help reveal the estimated £18.5 billion of hidden dealing charges alone each year.
Independent research commissioned by SCM shows only19% of savers and investors know how much they are 
being charged, while 83% want full disclosure of their investments and 89% want a full breakdown of charges.
Miller said as well as transparency over fees, there needs to be transparency over investments. 'We've seen a lot of 
scandals and misselling,' said Miller. 'Some of it is because people do not know what it is in their portfolios.'
He said he is calling on government, regulators, and the industry, as well as consumers, to adopt this code, to 
guarantee 100% transparency on fees and investments.He expects themove will encourage consumers to become 
more aware of their investments and help them save in the most efficient way.

MP Mark Garnier said: 'We have a colossal level of personal debt at a time when there are low interest rates. Many 
households have got used to this. But at some point we will move out of this low interest rate environment and it'll 
hit them like a HS2 charging through the Home Counties.'
Miller added: 'In the last day or two, a couple of [fund management] companies have said they believe in being 
transparent. We believe the industry will come together, adopt the label, and become more transparent.'

Airlines are honing their pilot recruitment strategies to meet short-term demand - but forecasters still predict a 
shortfall in flightcrew as fleet growth accelerates
Lufthansa trains cadets in Arizona
European airlines differ in their approaches to managing flightcrew, taking varying degrees of active involvement in 
initial training. What seems to unite them, however, is that they tactically plan their demand for cockpit personnel 
only a few years in advance. There is no clear, long-term industry standard on how the next pilot generation will be 
trained to command the large fleet in the manufacturers' orderbooks.
Boeing forecasts 92,500 pilots will be required in Europe during the next 20 years. Asia Pacific will need 183,200, 
with China accounting for 72,200 alone. North America is expected to require 82,800 pilots, Latin America 41,200, 
the Middle East 36,600, Africa 14,300, and the CIS 9,900 until 2030. These figures sum to about 460,000 in total.
While the aircraft backlog continues to increase in spite of shorter and more erratic economic cycles, there is 
widespread concern over whether pilot-training academies have kept pace with airline growth and can deliver 
enough new flightcrew with the required capabilities. British Airways changed its pilot recruitment strategy last 
August after it foresaw a potential flightcrew shortage. The UK carrier wants to employ about 800 pilots during the 
next five years. While it needs about 100 new employees per year to maintain its approximately 3,200-strong 
cockpit workforce, BA wants to employ 150 flightcrew members every year for growth. Half of these recruits should 
come via direct entry from other airlines and the military, while the other half will be career starters from ab initio 
level. This is BA's biggest pilot recruitment initiative in more than a decade.
The main difference lies in the renewed interest in ab initio students. BA employed fresh air transport pilot licence 
(ATPL) holders before, but those graduates had undertaken and financed their training independently and were 
hired from the open market after qualification. Self-funded training has become the main route into a cockpit for 
aspiring pilots since 2001, says Anthony Petteford, managing director for ab initio training at Oxford Aviation 
Academy (OAA) in the UK.
No Headline In Original
RETAIL TRAINING
Airlines, including BA, previously pre-financed the training of a limited number of ab initio students after they had 
undergone an initial selection process, with the young pilots repaying the fees later during employment. This 
changed, however, with the aviation downturn after 9/11 and the concurrent rise of budget carriers such as EasyJet 
and Ryanair, which had always drawn cockpit personnel from the open pilot market. Petteford points out that the 
shift to this "retail" training model has moved control over cadet enrolment numbers from airlines to individuals.
BA still does not pay for the flight training in three selected academies, but now helps its students secure the 
required funding by guaranteeing a bank loan. Access to credit has become a main hurdle for pilot aspirants 
because of the financial crises since 2008, threatening to turn the profession into a career option mainly for children 
from sufficiently affluent backgrounds. BA worked with banks to devise a loan scheme because it feared the pool of 
applicants made of the right stuff was becoming too limited.
BA sister carrier Iberia is also recruiting a large number of flightcrew, although this will only be for its planned low-
cost subsidiary Iberia Express, due to begin operations with four Airbus A320s at the end of March, which will 
gradually take over the parent's short- and medium-haul network. While 125 pilots are needed for the start-up 
phase, this is set to increase as the new airline is scheduled to have 13 aircraft by year-end and 40 by 2015. Iberia 
has traditionally recruited qualified pilots from a military or civilian background.
A number of flightcrew will transfer to Iberia Express from the parent carrier, which will concentrate exclusively on 
long-haul flights. The latter's approximately 1,500-strong cockpit workforce will gradually move up the ranks and 
convert to the A330/A340 fleet as senior flightcrew members retire. However, Iberia has no plans to recruit new 
pilots for the mainline operations. Whether it will be possible for Iberia Express flightcrew to transfer to the parent 
carrier is as yet unclear.
Lufthansa expects to take on about 300 new pilots this year. The German airline mainly recruits ab initio cadets who 
learn their trade at the in-house training campuses in Bremen and Goodyear, Arizona. Only if demand exceeds the 
available supply of career starters does the airline fall back on direct-entry pilots.
SPONSORSHIP
Unlike many of its European competitors, Lufthansa still sponsors the training of its cockpit staff, giving it complete 
control over the training quantity and quality. The selected students receive an interest-free loan from the airline of 
E60,000 ($77,000) to contribute to the training, which costs about E300,000 in total, says Lufthansa. The cadets are 
only responsible for their housing and living costs during the two-year training programme, and repay the loan later 
during employment.
Lufthansa's two Alpine subsidiaries - Austrian Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines - pursue the same 
paternalistic model. The former has stopped pilot recruitment for the time being because of restructuring. However, 
Swiss plans to employ 400 to 500 new pilots during the next five years, while about 100 are due to retire. The Swiss 
carrier has capacity to qualify up to 100 ab initio students a year. This is done partly in-house and at its partner 
academies Flugschule Grenchen, near Berne, and FlightSafety in Vero Beach, Florida. Any demand beyond that 
will need to be satisfied via direct-entry pilots or by utilising training capacity of the parent group.
Ryanair's pilot recruitment strategy, on the other hand, is firmly based on the retail model and on aspirants taking 
their own initiative to earn their wings. Since the training is self-sponsored, the financial details are "not a question 
for Ryanair", says the Irish budget carrier.
As with other airlines, the students even pay for their type rating at the company's simulator centre at East Midlands 
Airport, UK, or CAE in Amsterdam. Free line training is provided to students "subject to certain conditions". 
Nevertheless, Ryanair says it has a backlog of "several thousand" applications from ATPL holders. Between April 
2012 and April 2013, the airline plans to take on between 400 and 450 pilots.

Dublin and international analysts and brokers today hailed what Davy described as a "stellar" performance by 
Ryanair in its third quarter.
The Irish no-frills airline posted a profit of E14.9m compared with a loss of E10.3m in the same period last year 
compared to a Davy estimate of a loss of E2.5m and analysts' consensus of a loss of around E15.7m.
"This is a particularly strong performance given the unit cost increases of 11pc, driven primarily by the 18pc rise in 
fuel costs and a 7pc rise in sector lengths," said Davy's Stephen Furlong.
Ryanair has raised its profit forecast as it said that higher ticket prices were more than making up for expensive fuel 
and reduced capacity, underlining the resilience of its low-cost sector. "The EU recession, higher oil prices, the 
unfolding failure of the package tour operator model, significant competitor fare increases and capacity cuts, has 
created enormous growth opportunities for Ryanair," chief executive Michael O'Leary said. The airline reported a 
net profit of E15m, well ahead of a E16m loss forecast in a poll of analysts compiled by the company, after it 
grounded 80 of its 270 planes over the winter due to high fuel costs. Revenue came to E844m in the quarter, again 
ahead of an average analyst forecast of E819m. Average fares rose 17pc in the quarter from a year earlier, making 
up for a 2pc fall in passenger numbers. The airline said that unit costs rose 11pc due to a 7pc increase in sector 
lengths and an 18pc increase in fuel costs. A forecast E350m increase in the fuel bill next year "poses a significant 
cost challenge," Michael O'Leary said.

The ISEQ rose only slightly this morning to stand at 3,009, a rise of just 2 points as markets await the outcome of 
Greek negotiations which are expected to conclude today or tomorrow. Aviation is in the news again with Ryanair 
again outperforming expectations with a 13pc rise in revenues. NCB Stockbrokers reviewed the stock this morning 
in the light of this new information:
Analysis: Total revenues grew by 13pc to EUR844mn (consensus and NCB at EUR819mn), as passengers 
decreased by 2pc to 16.7mn and average fares rose by 17pc. Ancillary revenue per passenger rose by 8pc.
Facts: Ryanair reported a Q3 net profit of EUR15mn relative to our expectation of -EUR6mn and consensus of -
EUR16mn. In terms of outlook, Ryanair upped its FY'2012 net income guidance from EUR440mn to EUR480mn.
In terms of fares, Ryanair highlighted that they benefitted from reduced seat capacity, longer sectors, and higher 
competitor fares/fuel surcharges. We have upped our FY'13 fare assumption to +8.5pc to +6.0pc on the back of a 
continuation of those themes. Unit costs increased by 11pc due to a 7pc increase in sector lengths and an 18pc 
increase in fuel costs. Excluding fuel, sector length unit costs fell by 1pc. Ex fuel, we expect unit costs to increase 
by 2.1pc in FY'13 and 8pc inclusive of fuel costs. Ryanair is hedged 90pc at dollar 990/metric tonne for H1 FY'13 
and 70pc at dollar 1,000/metric tonne for H2 FY'13. In terms of the dollar, Ryanair is 100pc hedged at dollar 1.43 for 
the calendar year 2012. All in all our FY'13 net income forecast has been upped by 10pc to EUR558mn or EPS of 
38 cent a share, with EPS of 43 cent per share forecast for FY'14. Gross cash increased by EUR39.5mn since

The ISEQ rose only slightly this morning to stand at 3,009, a rise of just 2 points as markets await the outcome of 
Greek negotiations which are expected to conclude today or tomorrow. Aviation is in the news again with Ryanair 
again outperforming expectations with a 13pc rise in revenues. NCB Stockbrokers reviewed the stock this morning 
in the light of this new information:
Analysis: Total revenues grew by 13pc to EUR844mn (consensus and NCB at EUR819mn), as passengers 
decreased by 2pc to 16.7mn and average fares rose by 17pc. Ancillary revenue per passenger rose by 8pc.
Facts: Ryanair reported a Q3 net profit of EUR15mn relative to our expectation of -EUR6mn and consensus of -
EUR16mn. In terms of outlook, Ryanair upped its FY'2012 net income guidance from EUR440mn to EUR480mn.
In terms of fares, Ryanair highlighted that they benefitted from reduced seat capacity, longer sectors, and higher 
competitor fares/fuel surcharges. We have upped our FY'13 fare assumption to +8.5pc to +6.0pc on the back of a 
continuation of those themes. Unit costs increased by 11pc due to a 7pc increase in sector lengths and an 18pc 
increase in fuel costs. Excluding fuel, sector length unit costs fell by 1pc. Ex fuel, we expect unit costs to increase 
by 2.1pc in FY'13 and 8pc inclusive of fuel costs. Ryanair is hedged 90pc at dollar 990/metric tonne for H1 FY'13 
and 70pc at dollar 1,000/metric tonne for H2 FY'13. In terms of the dollar, Ryanair is 100pc hedged at dollar 1.43 for 
the calendar year 2012. All in all our FY'13 net income forecast has been upped by 10pc to EUR558mn or EPS of 
38 cent a share, with EPS of 43 cent per share forecast for FY'14. Gross cash increased by EUR39.5mn since 
September 2011 to EUR2,980mn. Gross debt decreased by EUR155.9mn, while net debt has fallen from

Ryanair raised its profit forecast this morning, saying higher ticket prices were more than making up for expensive 
fuel and reduced capacity, underlining the resilience of its low-cost sector as legacy carriers struggle.
The Irish low cost carrier, Europe's largest, increased its full year profit forecast by 9 percent to 480 million euros 
after posting revenue growth of 13 percent in the three months to Dec. 31.
"The EU recession, higher oil prices, the unfolding failure of the package tour operator model, significant competitor 
fare increases and capacity cuts, has created enormous growth opportunities for Ryanair," Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary said in a statement.
It reported a net profit of 15 million euros, well ahead of a 16 million loss forecast in a poll of 21 analysts compiled 
by the company, after it grounded 80 of its 270 planes over the winter due to high fuel costs.
Revenue was 844 million euros in the quarter, ahead of an average analyst forecast of 819 million. Average fares 
rose 17 percent in the quarter from a year earlier, making up for a 2 percent fall in passenger numbers.
A forecast 350 million euro increase in the fuel bill next year "poses a significant cost challenge," O'Leary said. The 
Irish carrier follows British low-cost rival EasyJet in posting strong revenue growth as higher-priced rivals are 
battered by fuel costs and a struggling global economy. German group Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Air France-KLM 
(AIRF.PA) have cut profit forecasts after being battered by fuel costs and slashed plans to expand in 2012. Ryanair, 
which expects passenger numbers to grow to 80 million passengers this year from 76 million in 2010, carried more 
international scheduled passengers than any other airline in 2010, according to the International Air Transport 
Association. ( C ) Reuters

The main Dublin shares index fell below the 3,000 level this morning as EU ministers meet in Brussels in an effort

By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 19.22 points to 2,988.32.
European leaders will struggle to reconcile austerity with growth on Monday at a summit due to approve a 
permanent rescue fund for the euro zone and put finishing touches to a German-driven pact for stricter budget 
discipline. Officially, the half-day summit is meant to focus mainly on ways to rekindle growth and create jobs at a 
time when governments across Europe are having to cut public spending and raise taxes to tackle mountains of 
debt. But disputes over the limits of austerity, and about Greece's unresolved debt restructuring negotiations with 
private bondholders, may sour efforts to send a more optimistic message that Europe is getting on top of its debt 
crisis.
Dublin and international analysts and brokers today hailed what Davy described as a "stellar" performance by 
Ryanair in its third quarter. The Irish no-frills airline posted a profit of E14.9m compared with a loss of E10.3m in the 
same period last year compared to a Davy estimate of a loss of E2.5m and analysts' consensus of a loss of around 
E15.7m. "This is a particularly strong performance given the unit cost increases of 11pc, driven primarily by the 
18pc rise in fuel costs and a 7pc rise in sector lengths," said Davy's Stephen Furlong. Shares in the airline, 
however, slipped 3c to E4.12 as investors had largely priced in the results. Shares in Aer Lingus jumped 7c to 
E0.85. According to Davy's Jack Gorman, this year is set to be another significant year for Elan. "Tysabri is well

(RTTNews) - European markets lost ground on Monday, adding to weakness seen late last week, as investors 
worried about the region's debt crisis.
France's CAC 40 index fell 53.12, or 1.6 percent, to 3,265.64. Germany's DAX index declined 67.53, or 1.04 
percent, to 6,444.45. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index dropped, 62.36 points, or 1.09 percent, to 5,671.09.
Negative sentiment was generated by a report from the Financial Times indicating that Greek Finance Minister 
Evangelos Venizelos angrily rejected a German plan for the euro zone to impose a budget overseer on Greece in 
return for a new 130 billion euro bailout.
According to the FT, Venizelos said the proposed move would improperly force his country to choose between 
"financial assistance" and "national dignity."
The report comes as European leaders are holding a summit in Brussels regarding the creation of a permanent 
rescue fund for the euro zone.
Budget airline Ryanair reported a profit for the third quarter, mainly reflecting a 17 percent increase in average 
fares. The Irish company also lifted its profit outlook for the full year.
Swiss engineering firm ABB agreed to buy U.S.-based electrical components maker Thomas & Betts for around 
$3.9 billion to expand its presence in the North American low-voltage products market. ABB is losing 1.4 percent.
In economic news, Eurozone economic confidence improved in January, posting the first increase in sentiment 
since March 2011, a survey by the European Commission showed.
Spain marked the first contraction in economic activity since the fourth quarter of 2009. Official figures showed that 
the Spanish economy shrank 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, in line with the quarterly estimates 
from the Bank of Spain.
Meanwhile, Italy successfully auctioned bonds at benign terms.

(RTTNews) - Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) posted third-quarter profit of 14.9 million euros or 1.02 cents per share 
versus a loss of 10.3 million euros or 0.69 cents per share a year ago.
Pre-tax profit was 15.5 million euros, compared to pre-tax loss of 12.7 million euros in the prior-year quarter.
Total operating revenues were up to 844.4 million euros from 746.3 million euros in the comparable period last 
year.
Announcing these results, Michael O'Leary, said,
"..Our Q3 Net Profit of ?15m was slightly ahead of guidance due to a combination of benign weather which caused 
fewer flight cancellations and significant de-icing savings, and a better performance on yields reflecting our planned 
winter capacity cuts, longer sectors, and higher competitor fares/fuel surcharges..."
The company said it now expects its full year profit will exceed previous guidance of 440 million euros and rise to 
480 million euros.
O'Leary, added, "..The EU recession, higher oil prices, the unfolding failure of the package tour operator model, 
significant competitor fare increases and capacity cuts, has created enormous growth opportunities for Ryanair, as 
large and smaller airports across Europe compete aggressively to win Ryanair's growth..."

(RTTNews) - The UK market fell on Monday, amid concerns ahead of the meeting of European Union leaders in 
Brussels later in the day. Investor sentiment was impacted by the ongoing talks between Greece and its private 
lenders on a deal necessary to prevent the nation from a default.
European Union leaders are meeting for the first time this year to finalize the details of a fiscal pact, while at the 
same time endorsing the bailout fund with a capacity of 500 billion euros. However, the meeting has been 
overshadowed by concerns about Greece's ability to strike a deal with private lenders.
The country will have to face a disorderly default if the Greek government fails to reach an agreement with its 
bondholders by March 20, when Athens must repay 14.5 billion euros of maturing debt.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is declining 0.87 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is losing 0.55 percent.
The FTSE 100 index is currently declining 0.68 percent.
Most miners are notably lower. Anglo American is declining 1.8 percent and Antofagasta is losing 2.3 percent. Steel 
maker Evraz is declining 4.8 percent.

(RTTNews) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Monday reported a profit for the third quarter, 
mainly reflecting a 17 percent increase in average fares. The Irish company also lifted its profit outlook for the full 
year.
In the third quarter, profit attributable to equity holders was 14.9 million euros or 1.02 euro cents per share, 
compared to a loss of 10.3 million euros or 0.69 euro cents per share reported in the previous year.
Pre-tax profit was 15.5 million euros, in comparison with a pre-tax loss of 12.7 million euros in the prior-year 
quarter.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the company said, "Our Q3 Net Profit of ?15m was slightly ahead of guidance 
due to a combination of benign weather which caused fewer flight cancellations and significant de-icing savings, 
and a better performance on yields reflecting our planned winter capacity cuts, longer sectors, and higher 
competitor fares/fuel surcharges."
Total operating revenues grew 13 percent to 844.4 million euros from 746.3 million euros in the same quarter last 
year, mainly due to a 17 percent increase in average fares. Ancillary revenues increased 6 percent to 177 million 
euros.
Total revenue per passenger grew 15 percent from last year. Meanwhile, number of passengers declined 2 percent 
to 16.7 million. Average fares improved 17 percent due to reduced seat capacity, longer sectors, and higher 
competitor fares/fuel surcharges.
The company said its yield performance improved as it grounded 80 aircraft and cut traffic by 2 percent. Operating 
margin increased 3 percent from the previous year.
Fuel & oil costs increased 18 percent to 333.6 million euros due to higher fuel prices and increased number of 
hours flown.
The company also said it now expects its full year profit to exceed its previous guidance of 440 million euros and 
rise to 480 million euros.
Ryanair Turns To Profit In Q3; Lifts Full-year View - Update
"The EU recession, higher oil prices, the unfolding failure of the package tour operator model, significant competitor 
fare increases and capacity cuts, has created enormous growth opportunities for Ryanair, as large and smaller 
airports across Europe compete aggressively to win Ryanair's growth," O'Leary added.
RYAAY closed Friday's regular trading at $33.53 on the Nasdaq.
RYA.L is currently trading at 4.25 pence, up 2.41 percent, on 469 thousand shares on the LSE.

(RTTNews) - The European markets are moderately lower on Monday, amid concerns ahead of the meeting of 
European Union leaders in Brussels later in the day. Investor sentiment was impacted by the ongoing talks between 
Greece and its private lenders on a deal necessary to prevent the nation from a default.
European Union leaders are meeting for the first time this year to finalize the details of a fiscal pact, while at the 
same time endorsing the bailout fund with a capacity of 500 billion euros. However, the meeting has been 
overshadowed by concerns about Greece's ability to strike a deal with private lenders.
The country will have to face a disorderly default if the Greek government fails to reach an agreement with its 
bondholders by March 20, when Athens must repay 14.5 billion euros of maturing debt.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is declining 0.79 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is losing 0.47 percent.

are losing 3.4 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.
E.ON is losing 1.3 percent, while RWE is adding 0.7 percent. Morgan Stanley raised RWE to "Overweight" from 
"Equalweight," while cutting E.ON to "Equalweight" from "Overweight."
Outside the main index, Hochtief is declining 4.4 percent after widening its loss forecast for 2011.
Stada is losing 3.5 percent after the stock was cut to "Hold" from "Add" at Commerzbank.
In Paris, BNP Paribas is declining 5.4 percent and Credit Agricole is dropping about 5 percent. Societe Generale is 
falling 4.9 percent. Merrill Lynch cut BNP Paribas to "Underperform" from "Neutral." The brokerage reduced Societe 
Generale to "Neutral" from "Buy."
Carrefour is falling 2.7 percent. The supermarket chain said its Board of Directors unanimously selected Georges 
Plassat to succeed Lars Olofsson, who has informed the Board that he would not seek the renewal of his mandate 
as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the next shareholders' meeting to be held on June 18.

In London, Rio Tinto is losing 0.9 percent. Goldman Sachs raised the stock to "Buy" from "Neutral."
Budget airline Ryanair reported a profit for the third quarter, mainly reflecting a 17 percent increase in average 
fares. The Irish company also lifted its profit outlook for the full year. The stock is losing 1.4 percent.
Philips is dropping 2.4 percent in Amsterdam. The consumer electronics giant reported a loss for the fourth quarter 
and issued a cautious outlook for 2012.
Swiss engineering firm ABB agreed to buy U.S.-based electrical components maker Thomas & Betts for around 
$3.9 billion to expand its presence in the North American low-voltage products market. ABB is losing 1.4 percent.

Budget airline Ryanair raised its full-year earnings guidance on Monday as it posted a strong profit in last three 
months of last year, with revenue gains more than compensating for fewer passengers.
Dublin-based Ryanair said it expected a full-year net profit of (EURO)480 million ($579 million), up (EURO)40 
million from previous guidance.
Ryanair shares were up 2.4 percent at (EURO)4.25 in early trading on the London Stock Exchange.
For the three months ending Dec. 31, Dublin-based Ryanair reported a net profit of (EURO)14.9 million, compared 
with a loss of (EURO)10.3 million a year earlier when operations were affected by severe winter weather in 
December.
Ryanair carried 16.7 million passengers during the period, down 2 percent compared to the previous year, but 
revenue was up 13 percent to (EURO)844 million.
The company said it increased yield by grounding 80 aircraft and raising fares by an average of 17 percent.

Fidelity warns on emergence of ' Ryanair ' fund pricing
Fidelity warns on emergence of 'Ryanair' fund pricing

Fidelity Worldwide Investment has argued that the asset management industry needs to create a new standard to 
bring greater transparency to investment charges as 'Ryanair' pricing starts to emerge.
Following on from Fidelity's decision in September last year to separately show fund manager, adviser and platform 
charges, the asset manager wants to see the industry work together to develop a standard approach to disclosing 
the total cost of owning a fund.
Fidelity says that current average total cost of owning a typical actively-managed £10,000 investment is £16.67 per 
month or £200 (roughly 2%) a year.
Fidelity is now calling for the industry to create a standardised system to display the breakdown of costs to investors 
across their fund ranges. Fidelity has offered their own examples of how this should be done: Charge Typical 
amount for an actively-managed fund, expressed in % and £ for £10,000 investment Typical amount for a low-cost 
active fund, expressed in % and £ for £10,000 investment Typical amount for an index tracker fund, expressed in % 
and £ for £10,000 investment Investment management charge 0.75% (£75 a year or £6.25 a month) retained by 
fund manager 0.40% (£40 a year or £3.33 a month) 0.1% (£10 a year or 83p a month) Other service and 
administration charges (eg legal and custody) 0.14% (£14 a year or £1.17 a month) passed on to service providers 
0.2% (£20 a year or £1.67 a month) 0.2% (£20 a year or £1.67 a month) Cost of advice or distribution 0.5% (£50 a 
year or £4.17 a month) 0.5% (£50 a year or £4.17 a month) Nil (for Moneybuilder UK Index but advice or distribution 
charges may apply in other cases and are often excluded from illustrations) Platform administration charge 0.25% 
(£25 a year or £2.08 a month) 0.10% (£10 a year or 83p a month) Nil (for Moneybuilder UK Index but platform 
charges may apply in other cases and are often excluded from illustrations) Stock Market dealing costs and 
Government stamp duty 0.36% (£36 a year or £3 a month) 0.25% (£25 a year or £2.08 a month) 0.09% (£9 a year 
or 75p a month) TOTAL ANNUAL COST OF OWNING A FUND (based on investment of £10,000) 2.00% (£200 per 
year or £16.67 a month) 1.45% (£145 a year or £12.08 a month) 0.39% (£39 a year or £3.25 a month)
Gary Shaughnessy (pictured), UK managing director, said: 'We are seeing selective and partial 'Ryanair' pricing 
start to emerge which runs the risk of misleading investors about the real costs they are paying. A consistent way of 
showing charges is essential to restoring investors' trust in the industry and encouraging them to feel confident to 
save for the future.
'Investment funds can provide a cost-effective way for investors to benefit from stock market growth and achieve 
their longer term goals. However, a lack of clarity around costs is distracting from the real benefits that investing in 
Fidelity warns on emergence of ' Ryanair ' fund pricing
funds has brought to millions of people in the UK and around the world. The communication of these charges needs 
to be more accessible to investors, visible at the point of purchase and brought into real pounds and pence terms.

**Anglo judgment against builder**
Anglo Irish Bank has secured a judgment against a Mullingar-based builder and property developer Shane Bell. The 
bank was granted a judgment of EUR 11.7 million against Bell, a director of Prima Construction, Prima Homes and 
Prima Holdings. Many of his companies were dissolved or went into liquidation in 2010.

**ECJ to rule on ash cloud liability**
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is to decide whether Ryanair is liable to pay costs to passengers who were 
delayed by the closure of European airspace following the Icelandic ash cloud in April 2010, *writes Kieron Wood*.
Passenger Denise McDonagh sued the airline for the EUR 1,129 that she spent on meals, accommodation and 
transport when her Ryanair flight was cancelled as a result of the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano.
The airline refused to pay McDonagh's costs, to which she would normally have been entitled under a 2004 EU 
regulation. It argued that the prolonged closure of European airspace went beyond even the "extraordinary 
circumstances" mentioned by the regulation.
The Dublin Metropolitan District Court has asked the ECJ to decide whether airlines must pay passengers' costs in 
such circumstances.

Cathal Guiomard, the Aviation Regulator, has rejected criticisms levelled at him by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, 
and has defended the body's EUR 1.8 million annual budget and staff of 18 people, which are paid for by the state.
O'Leary wrote to Guiomard a fortnight ago, asking him a series of questions about the work of the Commission of 
Aviation Regulation (CAR) and the increase in passenger charges at Dublin Airport. These went up in 2009, despite 
a significant fall-off in passenger numbers from the 2007 peak of 23.3 million.
In the letter, which was also sent to the Public Accounts Committee and Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar, 
O'Leary questioned why the CAR staff were, in his opinion, so highly paid. He asked why more than EUR 200,000 
had been paid for consultancy and PR services in 2010, and why rent of EUR 250,000 was being paid for a Dublin 
2 address for the regulator's office.
O'Leary wrote: "Having failed to replicate these effects of competition under your inadequate regulatory regime, 
Dublin Airport charges are now the most expensive of the 150 EU airports which Ryanair operates to. In 2011, the 
DAA's fees were also criticised as 'too excessive' by Etihad's chief executive, and as 'insane' by the chief executive 
of Aer Lingus."
In a reply to O'Leary, which was sent last Thursday and has been seen by *The Sunday Business Post*, Guiomard 
wrote that the 2009 increase in fees would not be reviewed or raised again until 2014, and that the CAR's work in 
the area of passenger rights was "completed omitted" from the Ryanair chief's communication.
He also said staff numbers had dropped from 22 to 18, and the budget of EUR 1.8 million represented a drop of 25 
per cent on the 2006 budget.
Guiomard said that his office, as regulators of the Irish travel industry also, had dealt with a huge volume of calls in 
2010 in relation to the volcanic ash problem, and that 2,800 claims -- worth EUR 4 million -- were settled for Budget 
Travel passengers after the company went bust that year.
Guiomard rejects O'Leary criticisms of CAR salaries
He wrote: "We prepared and published two consultation papers on aspects of airport price regulation . . . Each topic 
was one on which Ryanair disagreed . . . Sadly and somewhat contradictorily, Ryanair boycotted the consultations."
In reference to the wage bill for staff at the CAR, Guiomard said this was because a high proportion of the staff 
were qualified "to an advanced level in areas such as economics, law and accountancy, and act in those 
capacities".
He said that most of the consultancy spend in 2010 related to IT, and that the CAR had a lease on its Earlsfort 
Terrace office in the city because "many of those that visit the CAR might not find Dublin Airport a suitable 
alternative location".

Like transport ministers before him, Leo Varadkar is feeling the heat of Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary's theatrical 
outbursts.
Over the past 15 years, Mary O'Rourke, Séamus Brennan, Martin Cullen and Noel Dempsey have all been 
tormented by O'Leary's worldview of a government protecting state transport 'monopolies'.
Now O'Leary has made statements criticising Varadkar over the airport tax, and for not selling off Dublin Airport 
Authority along with its 'Taj Mahal' Terminal Two building.
But O'Leary's language is far less vitriolic than it was during under previous administrations, and on last week's Late 
Late Show, the airline boss went so far as to describe Varadkar as "very impressive". It was high praise indeed from 
a self-proclaimed "mean, greedy businessman only interested in profits".
The government's carrot to the airlines of axing the EUR 3 travel tax if they open new routes has so far failed to be 
taken up. It was a key part of the coalition's jobs initiative, announced shortly after it came into office.
But Varadkar was not willing to drop the tax in return for what he described as unrealistic demands by the airline 
chief.
The stand-off continues with some verbal jousting between the pair from time to time, but relations have not turned 
hostile.
Asked about O'Leary's statements, Varadkar was unruffled, recalling the Ryanair chief's Late Late Show 
appearance.
"Michael O'Leary said that he felt that I'd been captured a bit by the DAA and my department, which is funny, 
because the DAA and my department think that he's captured me, on the basis that I really admire the Ryanair 
model and admire him as a person," said Varadkar.
Bringing the diaspora back home
But the travel tax is a bugbear in their relationship. "I've met him a good few times now since I became minister, and 
I suppose I'm disappointed that we haven't been able to cut a deal.
"We have offered to get rid of the travel tax and the DAA have offered to substantially reduce charges for any extra 
passengers that Ryanair brings in, particularly on new routes.
"I thought at the outset we'd be able to meet half way ... It's in suspension, but the door is still open," he said.
"Essentially, Ryanair's been looking to abolish the travel tax and to have no charges at all for any new passengers 
for ten years, which is really not realistic," said Varadkar.
"Maybe that's the kind of deal you can get from Beauvais or a small airport in Spain somewhere, but it's not the kind 
of deal that we could offer. I think that if any government and any minister is going to be able to come to an 
agreement with Ryanair, it's us, and I just hope that he basically uses the opportunity," he added.
O'Leary has disputed figures showing an increase in visitor numbers for last year, and Varadkar said that, whatever 
measure was used, "one thing no one can dispute is that the numbers are up.
"What's interesting, as well, is that there has been a shift back to Aer Lingus, and that Aer Lingus has overtaken 
Ryanair again as the major carrier in and out of Ireland," he said.
The government's brainchild for next year is The Gathering, which it hopes can bring 350,000 visitors to Ireland, 
generating up to EUR 200 million for the economy in 2013.
"This can be really positive. The intention is to invite people of Irish descent home to the country -- or people with a 
connection to Ireland," he said.
The government will promote The Gathering internationally during St Patrick's week. A showpiece event will be held 
in Dublin, while cabinet ministers will also flag the event as part of their travel across the globe for St Patrick's Day.
The state's financial contribution to the launch events is still under negotiation, Varadkar said. But the government 
is also asking stakeholders "to bring money to the table".
"So, for example, the DAA -- in fairness to them -- are agreeing to put a few million towards it, which is extremely 
helpful. I've asked Aer Lingus to make a contribution towards it; that doesn't mean writing me a cheque, but it 
means them doing something for it.
"Etihad has also offered to do something for it. Ryanair haven't yet but, of course, I'd be happy to talk to them about 
it," Varadkar added.
"The real thing about The Gathering is it's not just a tourism initiative. There's a huge number of people around the 
country who actually ask: 'We want to get the country out of recession ... What can we do for our town? What can 
we do for our community?'," he said.
"In many ways, The Gathering is the answer to that question. Every town, community, every sports club, major 
business, alumni organisations and companies -- you name it -- can do something to help out The Gathering."
Varadkar has received 400 ideas from different groups. "There's huge enthusiasm and interest in it. Obviously, I 
can't meet everyone individually about it, but that's why we have the project team."
The team, headed by Ann Riordan, former chairwoman of Tourism Ireland, must have a business plan drawn up by 
the end of this month.
"Really it's a case of 'ask not what Tourism Ireland can do for you, but what you can do for Irish tourism'," Varadkar 
said.
Bringing the diaspora back home
"Some groups see it as a source of grants for stuff, which it's not. It's important to get the message out that there 
will be a small budget and it's about what you can bring to the table in terms of voluntary effort and initiative and 
money as well."
"We're asking universities to invite their foreign alumni home and we're asking immigrant communities in Ireland to 
invite their friends and relatives over."
The idea is to build up lasting links. "I do think that if it works there could be a diaspora legacy out of it, like they do 
in Israel.
"If you're a young Jewish person you get a free trip to Israel when you're 15 and 16 years ... It's very effective, it's 
called 'the birthright'," said Varadkar. "In India, I get an invitation -- they invite all politicians of Indian extraction 
around the world -- to come to India once a year and meet the prime minister.
"We don't do that, and we must have a huge caucus of Irish American congressmen and women, and Australian 
Irish," he said.
The contribution from the government over two years will be about EUR 10 million, "but I'm really looking for 
contributions from the private sector and other bodies to volunteer time around the country.
"This is something I think can be really great. It's something that I'm really serious about, but this isn't the Celtic 
tiger. This isn't some fund which you can tap into for festivals and building projects. This is a meitheal -- it's about 
what you can bring to the table."
**Some road projects could go ahead**
Some of the EUR 750 million spending cuts in the state's capital programme are likely to be restored after the sell-
off of semi-state assets.
"The troika will probably want to make sure that anything we do in reinstating the capital programmes actually 
stands up in terms of job creation and competitiveness," said transport minister Leo Varadkar.
"There are lots of good transport projects that I'd like to run by them. One thing we do on the transport side is 
benefit-to-cost ratios [BCR].
"I won't name particular roads, but particularly on national and regional roads, there are lots of projects that have 
positive BCRs," he said.
The government has an agreement with the troika that would see a allocation of a sizeable portion of state asset 
sales towards job creation.
"There is leeway in selling state assets and reinvesting the proceeds into the economy. By and large, I suspect it 
will bring the restoration of parts of the capital programme."
But Metro North would not be top of his list. "Metro was EUR 3.5 to EUR 4 billion, so even a sizeable portion of 
state asset sales wouldn't give you Metro," he said.

**Students told to think of jobs**
IDA chief executive Barry O'Leary has advised students who are filling out their CAO applications to consider 
courses in science, technology, engineering and maths.
O'Leary said that students should give some consideration to where the greatest job opportunities will be in the 
future and said that multinational firms locating in Ireland will play an important role. Ireland's availability of skilled 
labour is one of the primary reasons cited by IDA clients for establishing operations in Ireland, he said.
O'Leary said that in the last 12 months there has been a strong performance in job creation by multinational 
companies with export-led growth creating in excess of 13,000 new jobs.

Spain takes legal action against Spanair

Spain's government has launched legal action against the now-defunct airline Spanair for allegedly violating the 
country's aviation regulations by suddenly ceasing operations, a minister said Saturday.
An estimated 22,000 passengers who had booked seats on more than 220 canceled flights have been left looking 
for alternative arrangements and instructions on how to seek reimbursements. Spanair, owned by a consortium 
based in the northeastern region of Catalonia, shut down its operations late Friday because of a lack of funding.
The legal proceedings begun by Spain's government could lead to Spanair being fined (EURO)9 million ($11.8 
million) for two "serious infringements" of aviation security legislation, Development Minister Ana Pastor said. The 
alleged infractions related to obligations linked to continued service and passenger protection.
Chairman Ferran Soriano said the airline had failed to attract inward investment and consequently the regional 
government of northeastern Catalonia took the decision to stop providing funds. Spanair, whose hub was Barcelona 
airport, employed around 2,000 people and used the services of about 1,200 ground staff.
Spanair's financial woes were exacerbated by a 2008 crash that killed 154 people. Eighteen people survived what 
was Spain's worst aviation disaster in 25 years. The airline, which also ran a commuter service between Madrid and 
Barcelona, was in trouble financially before Spanair Flight JK5022 an MD-82 jet crashed on takeoff on Aug. 20, 
2008 as it tried to leave Madrid bound for the Canary Islands.
In 2010 Spanair, which was Spain's No. 4 airline, reported an operating loss of (EURO)115 million ($151.2 million) 
and had survived thanks to finance provided by the Catalan government and some private investors.
The Catalan government cited the "current economic climate" and "European legislation concerning competition" as 
the major factors influencing its decision.
In Brussels, the European Low Fares Airline Association said those of its members flying overlapping routes with 
Spanair would offer specially discounted fares to enable stranded passengers to return home. Offers are subject to 
seat availability, said the organization of budget airlines which includes Ryanair and EasyJet.
Spain takes legal action against Spanair
The association's secretary-general, John Hanlon, said in a statement the aim was to assist Spanair passengers 
who were experiencing difficulties with travel plans. National carrier Iberia Spanish Airlines SA said it had also 
offered to help.

Not content with trying to ease Franco-German tensions in one institution, Jean-Claude Trichet, the former head of 
the European Central Bank, is to try the trick again elsewhere. Mr Trichet has taken a board seat at EADS , the 
aerospace company, in which both governments have a 22.5 per cent stake.
If you haven't heard of Norwegian Air Shuttle yet, you might well do soon. The low-cost carrier with big ambitions 
this week put in orders for 222 new aircraft, worth $21.1bn, with Boeing and Airbus. It plans to open a new base in 
Malaga and launch long-haul routes. By contrast, Ryanair operates 277 aircraft and EasyJet 204.
McDonald's  latest foray into social media backfired as it was forced to pull a Twitter-based ad campaign. The fast 
food chain had encouraged customers to share their "McDStories", hoping to highlight the freshness of its food. 
Customers didn't play ball and instead filled the Twittersphere with horror stories about the restaurants.
There was much consternation among UK customers of O2 , the mobile phone operator. The company mistakenly 
allowed website owners to see the mobile numbers of O2 customers who had looked at their sites via their mobiles, 
leading to privacy concerns. O2 blamed technical changes for the error.

EasyJet aided by increased baggage charges

Rising baggage charges and weakening competition helped EasyJet push up revenues per seat by 8 per cent in the 
three months tos December, buoying investor confidence.
The mild winter also helped Europe's secondbiggest budget carrier, with an absence of snow-related disruptions 
increasing the number of seats flown in its first quarter and subduing unit costs other than fuel.
Revenues per seat, including surcharges for bags and bookings, rose by almost 10 per cent year on year to £51.83 
, and 7.7 per cent at constant currencies.
EasyJet forecast a similar rise for the full first half, suggesting pre-tax losses for the period in the £140m to £160m 
range - in line with last year's £153m loss .
The shares rose 41.7p, or 10.3 per cent, to 445.5p, a level last seen early in 2011.
"The thing that struck me was the earnings momentum," said Edward Stanford at Oriel Securities.
He said the danger of higher baggage and booking surcharges was fares slipping to accommodate them, but added 
that EasyJet appeared to have avoided that fate, with passengers paying an average of 6.5 per cent more per seat.
But innovations aimed at boosting the number of higher-paying business passengers are not yet proving drivers of 
top-line growth.
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, EasyJet's founder and biggest shareholder, yesterday lambasted management for 
trumpeting an incremental, 200,000-strong rise in the number of passengers who said they were travelling on 
business.
Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Espirito Santo, warned that the "past year or so has been about the preparatory work".
EasyJet aided by increased baggage charges
Costs per seat rose by 2.5 per cent, excluding the impact of the snow last year as well as fuel costs. The company 
is expecting its first-half fuel bill to rise by £100m.
  FT Comment 
EasyJet has shown itself as being astute at short-term planning, keeping its aircraft as full in winter as summer 
through capacity adjustments. But it has yet to see the benefits of a longer-term project: bringing in large batches of 
business travellers. Some of the airline's ploys, such as using travel agents, should not rack up big costs but others 
might be harder to prove worthwhile - all with an eagle-eyed Sir Stelios watching. Until EasyJet demonstrates it is 
the business flyer's budget carrier of choice - and that business people are choosing budget carriers in significant 
numbers - its aggressively low-cost rival Ryanair, with a 2012 price to earnings ratio just a point and a half ahead of 
EasyJet's 12.3 times, looks the safer bet.

The ISEQ bounced back after four days of lows today as markets worldwide received a shot in the arm from the US 
Fed, who said rates would stay near zero for the near future.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was up 60.57 points to 3,043.21.
European stocks gained ground as a dovish tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve and rekindled hopes of a Greek 
debt deal helped shares resume their brisk five-week rally. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was 
up 0.7 percent at 1,046.97 points, bouncing back after a two-day pullback. The euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 
50 index was up 1.1 percent at 2,447.18 points, after hitting a 3-month high earlier in the session and flirting with its 
200-day moving average.
At home, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) surprised the markets yesterday with an offering to 
switch holders of bonds maturing in January 2014 to a new bond issue, maturing in February 2015. The offer 
marked the Irish sovereign's first engagement with bond markets since the EU/IMF package was agreed in late 
2010. Ryanair shares soared 12c to E4.13. Rival, EasyJet'srevenue was up by 16.7pc to £763m, driven by a strong 
improvement in unit revenues which were up 9.2pc to £51.83 per seat. Revenue per seat at constant currency grew 
by 7.7pc as reported revenues benefited from the strength of the Swiss franc. Both ticket and non-ticket unit 
revenues showed good growth in the quarter, while average sector length declined slightly. Consensus revenue 
was £733m (range £713-751m). Passenger revenue per seat increased by 6.5pc to £40.29, helped by flat 
competitor capacity. Fees and charges increased by £1.24 to £5.88 per seat. Shares in Aer Lingus climbed 3c to 
E0.78. Smurfit Kappa's stocks rose 27c to E6.17. Hamburger, which is the fifth-largest containerboard producer in 
Europe, has announced a E100/tonne increase in recycled containerboard prices for Q1 and also plans to take an 
additional 15,000 tonnes of production downtime in January/February.

Norwegian in deals to buy 222 Boeing and Airbus jets

Norwegian Air Shuttle plans to buy 222 new aircraft, costing $21.1bn at list prices, from Boeing and Airbus in a 
move that heralds its ambition to become one of Europe's leading low-cost airlines.
Boeing secured its largest ever European deal through a firm order by the Oslo-based airline for 122 737 narrow-
body aircraft, listed at $11.4bn.
Norwegian also departed from its policy of only operating Boeing aircraft by making a commitment to purchase 100 
A320 narrow-body aircraft from Airbus, costing $9.7bn at list prices.
Analysts said Norwegian's orders looked like a bet on the demise of SAS, the struggling Scandinavian carrier.
Norwegian's shares closed up almost 13 per cent at NOK74.5. SAS dropped 1 per cent to SEK9.
Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian's chief executive and one of its founders, told the Financial Times that the airline would focus 
its expansion on Nordic countries, although he highlighted plans to open a new operating base this March in 
Malaga, Spain.
Mr Kjos, a former fighter pilot in the Norwegian air force, who is a lawyer and author of a spy thriller, also 
highlighted Norwegian's plans to begin long-haul operations next year, with flights linking Scandinavia with Asia and 
the US.
Norwegian started its low-cost carrier operations in 2002. It has operating bases in Norway, Denmark, Finland and 
Sweden, although Norwegian's routes reach beyond Europe into north Africa and the Middle East.
Its fifth-largest shareholder is Finnair, Finland's flag-carrier.
Aircraft financing has become more difficult to obtain since the financial crisis, but Mr Kjos expressed confidence 
that Norwegian's orders with Boeing and Airbus would secure loan guarantees from European and US export credit 
agencies.
Norwegian in deals to buy 222 Boeing and Airbus jets
Norwegian's orders should increase its fleet from 64 to between 150 and 200 by 2020, because some of the new 
aircraft will replace existing ones.
Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline by passenger numbers, has 277 aircraft, while EasyJet, the second 
largest, has 204. Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at RBS, said Norwegian's orders looked like "a gamble on SAS 
failing".
The deals with Boeing and Airbus underline airlines' appetite for fuel-efficient aircraft because of high oil prices .
Airbus will start delivering its A320neo aircraft to Norwegian in 2016. Boeing will begin supplying its 737 Max jets in 
2017.

Budget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA on Wednesday said it has ordered 222 new aircraft from Boeing and 
Airbus in separate deals with a combined worth of $127 billion in list prices.
The total order, which includes 122 Boeing 737 aircraft and 100 Airbus A320 planes for delivery starting in 2016, is 
the largest ever aircraft purchase in Europe, Norwegian Air Shuttle said.
"Today is a historic day for Norwegian," CEO Bjoern Kjos said. "We have secured our fleet renewal for years to 
come and are very pleased with the agreements with both Airbus and Boeing."
In 2002, Ryanair ordered 100 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and took options on 50 more. The list price at the time was 
$9.1 billion.
Norwegian Air Shuttle, one of Europe's fastest growing airlines, sees the acquisition of new, fuel-efficient aircraft as 
key to its strategy to offer low-cost fares. It has expanded rapidly in Europe, and Kjos told The Associated Press 
last month that it's planning to launch long-haul operations, with flights to New York and Bangkok scheduled to start 
in early 2013.
The deal with Boeing includes orders for 100 Boeing 737 MAX8s and 22 Boeing Next-Generation 737-800s, in 
addition to purchase rights for an additional 100 737 MAX8 aircraft. Boeing said Norwegian is the first European 
carrier to complete an order for its 737 MAX aircraft.
"The total order is valued at $11.4 billion at list prices and represents the largest-ever Boeing order from a 
European airline," the American company said.
The Airbus agreement is for 100 Airbus A320neo planes, with purchase rights for an additional 50. The neo is a 
modified version of the existing workhorse jet, the A320, with improved engines and modified wingtips to make it 
more fuel-efficient.
The A320neo lists for (EURO)96.7 million (126 million) each, but airlines negotiate discounts for bulk orders.
Norwegian carrier buys 222 Boeing , Airbus planes
Kjos declined to reveal the price tags negotiated with Boeing and Airbus but said "we have gotten deals that 
otherwise wouldn't be able to get because we're first."
Kjos said the deals will be financed by loans guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States and 
European export credit agencies.
"The banks will be financing the deals against a state guarantee from the agencies," Kjos told AP.
Norwegian Air Shuttle shares jumped 8.3 percent to 71.50 kroner ($12.16) in Oslo after the deals were announced.
"It's a massive order which shows a big ambition on behalf of Norwegian," said John Strickland, director of London-
based aviation consultancy firm JLS Consulting.
The challenge will be to place the new planes in routes and markets where they can fill the seats, and not end up in 
a situation where "suddenly you're raking in losses instead of paying for the planes," Strickland said.
Unlike budget carriers Ryanair and EasyJet, which are flying from destinations across Europe, Norwegian is 
focused on the Scandinavian market. Last year, the airline flew about 13 million passengers, rapidly gaining ground 
on regional competitor Scandinavian Airlines.
Norwegian, which had previously only used Boeing planes, said it would benefit from using two aircraft suppliers 
"both in terms of ensuring adequate flight capacity, flexibility and competition between two manufacturers."
Kjos, a former fighter pilot, owns 27 percent of Norwegian, founded in 1993 and listed on the Oslo stock exchange 
10 years later. After struggling to make a profit in its early years, Norwegian bought competitor FlyNordic from 
Finnair in 2007 and ordered 42 new Boeing 737 planes, lowering fuel and maintenance costs.
Before the announcement Wednesday, Norwegian had placed orders for 55 Boeing 737-800 and six Boeing 787 
Dreamliners.

EU Probes Irregularities In French, German , Swedish Air Transport Sector

Body
(RTTNews) - The European Commission has opened three distinct in-depth investigations and extended the scope 
of a fourth investigation into contracts in air transport sector in France, Germany and Sweden.
The Commission said on Wednesday that it would investigate whether financial arrangements between public 
authorities and the airports of Niederrhein-Weeze, Altenburg-Nobitz (both in Germany), Pau (France) and Västerås 
(Sweden), as well as rebates and marketing agreements concluded between these airports and some of the airlines 
using them, were in line with EU State aid rules. The opening of proceedings gives interested third parties an 
opportunity to submit comments on the measures under assessment; it does not prejudge the outcome of the 
investigation.
Investments by public authorities into companies carrying out economic activities are in line with EU state aid rules 
when they are made on terms that a private player operating under market conditions would accept (the market 
economy investor principle, MEIP).
In the aviation sector, infrastructure investment subsidies can in principle be found compatible with the guidelines 
on state aid in the aviation sector when they are necessary, proportionate, pursue an objective of general interest, 
ensure non-discriminatory access for all users and do not unduly affect trade in the internal market. Operating 
support is far more likely to distort competition between airports and is therefore in principle incompatible with the 
internal market.
On the basis of the information at its disposal, the Commission cannot exclude that the measures in favor of the 
four airports and their customer airlines involve state aid which gives them an unfair advantage vis-à-vis their 
competitors and is thus incompatible with the internal market.
Niederrhein-Weeze is a regional airport in North Rhine-Westphalia, near Duisburg. It has allegedly received over 
the last ten years several loans or grants on terms that differ from market conditions. In addition, it is experiencing 
financial difficulties and its operations appear to be dependent on public support. The Commission, therefore, has 
doubts that the public authorities acted in accordance with the MEIP and that the airport could operate under 
market conditions.
Altenburg-Nobitz is a regional airport in Thüringen. Between 2000 and 2009, it received several capital contributions 
from shareholders to cover its losses. The Commission has doubts that the MEIP has been respected and that the 
airport could operate under market conditions. Moreover, the Commission has concerns that contractual rebates or 
EU Probes Irregularities In French, German , Swedish Air Transport Sector
marketing arrangements concluded between the airport and the low-cost airline Ryanair could procure the latter an 
undue economic advantage over its competitors.
Västerås is a regional airport around 100 kilometers from Stockholm. It allegedly has received operating aid and 
several shareholder contributions to cover its losses since 2001. Moreover, the Commission has concerns that 
marketing and airport charge arrangements with Ryanair could procure an undue economic advantage to the latter 
that its competitors do not have.
Pau is a regional airport in Pyrénées-Atlantiques. In 2007, the Commission had opened an in-depth investigation 
into contracts concerning the use of the Pau airport infrastructure and the provision of marketing services to 
promote the location. The Commission has now extended the scope of this investigation to cover all contracts 
concluded by the airport with airlines between 2003 and 2011 as well as several infrastructure subsidies and other 
public measures granted in favor of the airport during this period.
The European Commission plans to adopt new guidelines on aviation - covering both airlines and the financing of 
airport infrastructure - following a public consultation this year.

RYANAIR Espirito Santo rates the airline "buy" and has a target price of (EURO)4.60. The broker is expecting the 
firm to post a net loss of (EURO)18m in its quarterly results next week, on revenues of (EURO)806m. It thinks 
Ryanair's current trading is on track and that the firm's decision to cut capacity over the winter has helped its 
performance.
However, Espirito Santo remains cautious over the short-term.
SAINSBURY Panmure Gordon has upgraded the supermarket to "buy", with a target price of 350p. The broker has 
upgraded Sainsbury on the basis of its strong dividend yield of 5.4 per cent, plus its 41 per cent trading discount to 
the firm's current net asset value. Panmure also holds a positive view on Tesco, despite its recent profit warning, as 
it believes the food market is still growing.
H&M Liberum rates the clothes retailer "sell" with a target price of SEK170. The broker expects to see a 0.9 per 
cent slowdown in like-for-like sales when the firm reports full year results tomorrow. It blames increased competition 
in its European markets for the slump, and thinks H&M should revamp its stores to appeal to more aspirational 
shoppers in the region.

Turkish Airlines eyes deal for Poland 's Lot

Shares in Turkish Airlines (Turk Hava Yollari) rose yesterday after the group said it was looking at buying Lot, but 
some analysts said they saw little logic in a deal to take control of the lossmaking Polish flagcarrier.
The Turkish flag-carrier said it had authorised its executive committee to carry out a "pre-examination of the 
privatisation process and investment potential of Lot" - a formal step that went beyond a 2010 expression of interest 
in the Polish group by chief executive Temel Kotil.
His group has expanded rapidly, increasing its now 180-strong fleet by more than 50 aircraft in the past three years 
and spending a record amount on advertising in an attempt to raise its profile.
Shares in Turkish Airlines, which is 49 per cent state-owned, rose by more than 3 per cent on the Istanbul stock 
exchange, but some analysts expressed concern about debt levels, potential profitability and hub management of a 
merged group.
The company's net debt increased from TL4.2bn in 2010 to TL7.1bn ($3.9bn) at the end of the third quarter last 
year and currency weakness brought profits for the third quarter down to TL77m, with the airline recording a net 
loss of TL467m over the first nine months of the year.
"In this difficult time I don't think such an acquisition would be necessary," said Erdem Haf zoglu at BGC Partners in 
Istanbul, emphasising the impact of high oil prices and mediocre economic growth in Europe. "I don't believe they 
are in need of another hub right now."
The Polish state, which owns 93 per cent of Lot, has been seeking to privatise the carrier for several years - Lot has 
forecast losses of ZL50m ($15m) in 2011. Magdalena Kobos, for the treasury ministry, told the Financial Times that 
Turkish Airlines representatives had discussed the matter in Warsaw in December. She added there was also 
another potential bidder for Lot, which she said wanted to remain anonymous but has been described as publicly 
listed.
Turkish Airlines eyes deal for Poland 's Lot
Although a timetable for discussions has not yet been set, Poland wants to wrap up the deal by the end of this year.
Ms Kobos also cautioned that there was as yet no decision on the size of the sale. The government would have to 
take Lot off a list of strategically important companies to sell more than a 50 per cent stake.
Founded in 1929, making it one of the world's oldest airlines, Lot faces two challenges. It is too small to compete for 
long-distance traffic against large carriers such as its Star Alliance partner, Lufthansa, and faces stiff competition 
from budget airlines such as Ryanair and Hungary's Wizzair on short-haul routes.

The ISEQ rally built up a head of steam this morning as strong demand and falling yields at Spanish and French 
debt sales soothed worries over the euro zone debt crisis.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was up 32.98 points to 2,985.22.
Yields dropped and demand was solid at France's bond sale, the country's first auction since Standard and Poor's 
stripped the country of its AAA credit rating, while Spain sold far more longer-term debt than expected, with yields 
down more than 150 basis points from a previous sale of the same bonds in November.
Low-cost carriers (LCCs) are Davy's preferred play in a weak eurozone environment. "We see real pricing power for 
market leaders Ryanair and easyJet. As we look into Q1 and Q2, capacity conditions appear beneficial for both 
airlines and competitive pressures are benign. We expect further cost benefits for Ryanair as capacity is reallocated 
to favourable airport locations. easyJet should gain from 'easy' comparables and from the group's strategy overview 
to be presented at its capital markets day on January 31st. Cash returns are a key feature in 2012: easyJet will 
provide a 11.5pc dividend yield; Ryanair has c.E1bn pre-capex free cash flow, which allows for significant returns to 
shareholders," the broker said. Shares in Ryanair rose 3c to E3.99 while Aer Lingus jumped 5c to E0.71. 
Associated British Foods notes a highly competitive trading environment. US bakery industry selling prices rose by 
5pc year-on-year (yoy) and by 0.1pc month-on-month (mom) in December 2011. For the same periods, the selling 
price of finished consumer foods by manufacturers rose by 6.1pc and declined by 0.5pc respectively - so bakery 
selling prices lag the rise in food prices generally. Shares in Aryzta fell 15c to E35.15.

The ISEQ surged past the 3,000 level today amid relief that the bond markets ignored ratings downgrades and 
bought up Spanish and French bonds and as the Troika gave Ireland top marks in its latest review.
The index rose 84.83 points to 3,037.07.
European shares advanced for a fourth straight session as strong auctions of euro zone debt and encouraging 
results from top U.S. banks triggered a rally led by battered financial stocks. Euro zone banks, which had fallen 
38pc last year on fears relating to their holdings of sovereign debt, rallied 7.6 percent on the back of healthy 
demand for French and Spanish bonds, a show of confidence in regional governments' ability to refinance their 
debt. Also supporting the sector were fourth-quarter earnings from U.S. lenders Morgan Stanley, which beat market 
expectations, and Bank of America, which turned to a net profit from a loss the year before.
Ireland got its quarterly pat on the back from the bailout partners today but the EU/ECB/IMF Troika cut their forecast 
for Irish GDP growth to 0.5pc from their previous 1pc growth prediction. Speaking at a press conference, Troika 
officials confirmed earlier comments from Finance Minister Michael Noonan that the three institutions were working 
together to develop a common paper on a possible alternative to the promissory notes being used to prop up Anglo 
Irish Bank. For the first time in weeks, bank shares moved. Bank of Ireland rose 1c to E0.10 and AIB gained 1c to 
E0.06 - both are off well over 99pc from their Celtic Tiger highs. Shares in CRH climbed 80c to E16.20 and Kerry 
was up 60c to E28.70. Concrete products group Readymix says it has received an approach about a possible 
takeover offer from a company called Readymix Investments, which is a subsidiary of Cemex Espana. Readymix 
shares surged by 533pc or 16c to E0.19. Low-cost carriers (LCCs) are Davy's preferred play in a weak eurozone

The ISEQ surged past the 3,000 level today amid relief that the bond markets ignored ratings downgrades and 
bought up Spanish and French bonds and as the Troika gave Ireland top marks in its latest review.
The index rose 84.83 points to 3,037.07.
European shares advanced for a fourth straight session as strong auctions of euro zone debt and encouraging 
results from top U.S. banks triggered a rally led by battered financial stocks. Euro zone banks, which had fallen 
38pc last year on fears relating to their holdings of sovereign debt, rallied 7.6 percent on the back of healthy 
demand for French and Spanish bonds, a show of confidence in regional governments' ability to refinance their 
debt. Also supporting the sector were fourth-quarter earnings from U.S. lenders Morgan Stanley, which beat market 
expectations, and Bank of America, which turned to a net profit from a loss the year before.
Ireland got its quarterly pat on the back from the bailout partners today but the EU/ECB/IMF Troika cut their forecast 
for Irish GDP growth to 0.5pc from their previous 1pc growth prediction. Speaking at a press conference, Troika 
officials confirmed earlier comments from Finance Minister Michael Noonan that the three institutions were working 
together to develop a common paper on a possible alternative to the promissory notes being used to prop up Anglo 
Irish Bank. For the first time in weeks, bank shares moved. Bank of Ireland rose 1c to E0.10 and AIB gained 1c to 
E0.06 - both are off well over 99pc from their Celtic Tiger highs. Shares in CRH climbed 80c to E16.20 and Kerry 
was up 60c to E28.70. Concrete products group Readymix says it has received an approach about a possible 
takeover offer from a company called Readymix Investments, which is a subsidiary of Cemex Espana. Readymix 
shares surged by 533pc or 16c to E0.19. Low-cost carriers (LCCs) are Davy's preferred play in a weak eurozone

Ryanair today said that it plans to create over 1,000 new jobs in 2012 for pilots, cabin crew, engineers and 
sales/marketing people as its fleet will grow from 270 to 305 aircraft but that none of these jobs will be in Ireland.
"While many of these jobs will be taken up by Irish people, sadly none will be based in Ireland, where a combination 
of high charges at the Government owned airports, and the Govt's E3 travel tax, means that seat capacity and 
traffic at the DAA airports will continue to decline, while Ryanair grows rapidly with 5 more bases in Europe, where 
airports offer considerably lower fees and other EU governments do not tax visitors. Already in 2012, Ryanair has 
announced 5 new bases in Billund (Denmark), Wroclaw (Poland), Palma (Spain), Manchester (UK) and Paphos in 
Cyprus. Ryanair expects its traffic to grow from 76m passengers in 2011 to 80m in 2012," it said.
"Ryanair looks forward to another strong year of fleet and traffic growth in 2012 and we are proud to create over 
1,000 new jobs in Europe for pilots, cabin crew, engineers and sales and marketing people, as Ryanair's 
unmatched lowest fares, and no fuel surcharge guarantee continues to make Ryanair one of Ireland's very few, 
world leading, multinational success stories," said spokesman Stephen McNamara.
"While Ryanair has grown rapidly to become the No.1 airline in Spain, Italy, the UK and many other EU countries, 
we continue to reduce flights, traffic and job numbers here in Ireland, where the DAA monopoly airports are totally 
uncompetitive, and even Aer Lingus has described Dublin Airport's fees as "insane". Sadly the new Irish 
Government continues to follow the failed policy of its predecessor by supporting the DAA monopoly's high and 
rising airport fees, and the crazy tourist tax which has seen traffic at the three Govt owned DAA airports decline 
from 30m passengers in 2007, to just 22m in 2011."

Irish gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by just 0.4 per cent this year and 1.4 per cent in 2013, according to 
Davy.
The company has sharply cut its previous forecast for GDP growth of 1.7 per cent in 2012 and 1.6 per cent in 2013.
It has also cuts its gross national product (GNP) - a narrower measure of economic activity which excludes 
multinational firms. The company predicts GNP will contract by 0.4 per cent in 2012 compared to its previous 
forecast of 1 per cent.
Davy said it expected export growth to slow from 4.5 per cent in 2011 to 2.8 per cent this year, despite gains in 
competitiveness. It sees employment falling by 0.4 per cent in 2012, but forecasts it will rise gradually in 2013. The

to an industry expert. While the overall redundancy situation is "very negative" for employees, a number of IFSC-

CorporateSpinouts.com. "The headline position is that the domestic banking situation is absolutely on the floor, but 
the [international] or export-oriented banking sector in Ireland is stable or growing," Mr Coyle said. Ireland is now 
one of the world's largest fund management centres. Bank employees who have worked in specific back office-type 
roles, and functions such as compliance and internal audit, have skills that are directly transferable to fund 
administration. Even bank staff without these specific types of experience will make more attractive candidates for 
fund management roles than "complete newcomers" to the banking industry, he said. The Irish Times XXXX

One of the UK's few publicly owned airports has not ruled out a partprivatisation to raise money for acquisitions but 
said it was "unlikely" to bid for Edinburgh airport.
Charlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, the second-biggest airport operator in the UK, said it 
would look at all opportunities but was not keen on Edinburgh, put up for sale by owner BAA because of 
competition rules. "It is unlikely we will be making a bid for it. It is slightly on the small side for us," he told the 
Financial Times.
"Scotland has 4.5m people and four airports. Within two hours of Manchester there are 28m people." Edinburgh 
handled 9.4m passengers last year, half the level of Manchester.
MAG has nearly completed a strategic review which includes several options for fundraising, including selling a 
minority stake. The 10 local authorities in Greater Manchester own MAG, with 55 per cent in the hands of 
Manchester city council.
However, it could also team up with other companies. In 2009 it bid for Gatwick airport, also on offer from BAA, 
jointly with Borealis , a Canadian infrastructure fund.
Manchester city council views the airport as a strategic asset to attract inward investors and has ruled out a sell-off 
in the past.
Mr Cornish said the ownership structure had served the group well, allowing long-term investment. Manchester is 
the only airport outside London with more than one runway and which can accommodate the A380 superjumbo.
"Our shareholders are very supportive," he said. "Most decisions are delegated to the board. They are interested in 
economic generation for the region and in the asset value of the group." Mr Cornish was cautious about any bid for 
Stansted, which BAA may also have to sell depending on the outcome of legal action. "We would have a look but it 
is very reliant on low cost and 60 per cent of flights are Ryanair.
Airport operator reviews growth options
"I would not say we would definitely do it."
MAG, which owns Manchester, East Midlands, Bournemouth and Humberside airports, serves about 25m 
passengers annually.
It aims to boost the number of lucrative business travellers to reduce dependence on the package holiday and low-
cost trade that dominates traffic.
Mr Cornish made a renewed attack on the increase in air passenger duty. "EasyJet was looking at routes into 
Manchester but went to continental Europe because of the tax. We pay more in aviation taxes than we make in 
aviation charges," he said. MAG collected an estimated £228m in tax against £116m in aviation income in the year 
to April 2011.
George Osborne, the chancellor, last week launched Manchester's Airport City, a £659m development by MAG to 
house offices, hotels, logistics and manufacturing research centres. The project aims to create more than 21,000 
jobs over 15 years.

EUROPE'S laws and taxes on airlines were brought into sharp focus yesterday, as routes were scrapped and 
Ryanair hiked its charges in response to regulations.
Low-cost carrier Air Asia X ditched its Gatwick to Kuala Lumpur flight as part of its withdrawal from unprofitable 
routes over the next year.
Its only UK route, which was introduced in 2009, will stop in March alongside flights from Paris and Delhi. Flights 
from Mumbai will be scrapped at the end of January.
Air Asia X blamed the UK's air passenger duty, the European emissions trading scheme (ETS) and higher fuel 
costs for the closures.
"The continued high jet fuel prices and the weakening demand for air travel from Europe, brought about by the 
current economic situation together with exorbitant government taxes, have placed cost pressures on operating 
long-haul low cost flights between Asia and Europe, compromising our ability to offer the low fares Air Asia X is 
known for," said chief executive Azran Osman-Rani.
Gatwick Airport said in a statement: "We are very disappointed to be losing Air Asia X... We believe the Treasury 
must pay far closer attention to the impact of this issue as the decision by Air Asia X is clear evidence that the 
burden of additional taxation in all its forms is a material consideration for long haul airlines flying to the UK."
And budget airline Ryanair said it plans to charge all its customers an extra 25p per flight to pay for what it calls the 
"eco-looney" ETS.

Ryanair's charge, which will be introduced from Tuesday, will help offset the (EURO)15m-(EURO)20m that the firm

Ryanair today said it is to levy its customers E0.25 per one way ticket to cover the EU's new carbon tax or 
Emissions Trading System Tax (ETS).
The no-frills airline says it will cost its passengers between E15m and E16m this year.
Ryanair and other airlines opposed the introduction of the tax, saying it is a stealth tax that will damage traffic, 
tourism, European competiveness and jobs.
"Ryanair will introduce a 25c ETS levy on every seat from Tues 17th January next to cover our estimated E15m - 
E20m ETS bill for 2012. Ryanair does not believe that European aviation should be included in the ETS scheme

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said it would introduce a 0.25 euros levy per passenger for all 
bookings made from Tuesday 17th January next to cover the costs of the EU's new eco-looney ETS tax, that would 
cost Ryanair passengers 15 million euros - 20 million euros during 2012.
The company noted that the ETS impact on Ryanair passengers at 0.25 euros per one way booking would be less 
than the impact upon those travelling with other EU airlines as Ryanair is Europe's greenest, cleanest, airline, as 
confirmed by Brighter Planet 2011 report, which enjoys lower ETS costs than high fare European flag carrier 
airlines who operate older, noisier, more polluting aircraft.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said, "Ryanair does not believe that European aviation should be included in the ETS 
scheme since it accounts for less than 2% of the EU's CO2 emissions. This latest EU stealth tax will damage traffic, 
tourism, European competiveness and jobs at a time when no other economic block is including aviation in their

The ISEQ's rally went in to reverse today as Aryzta stock fell sharply and as investors reacted to some of the most 
strident language yet from a ratings agency on the eurozone debt crisis.
The euro and global stocks fell after ratings agency Fitch called on the European Central Bank to do more to solve 
the currency bloc's debt crisis, unnerving investors ahead of auctions for Spanish and Italian bonds later in the 
week. U.S. stock index futures also turned lower, pointing to a weaker start on Wall Street, hurt by computer giant 
Microsoft's warning that sales of personal computers will probably be lower than analysts expect in the fourth 
quarter. The euro hit session lows of dollar 1.2695 after Fitch said the ECB needed to ramp up its buying of troubled 
euro zone debt to support Italy and prevent a "cataclysmic" collapse of the euro.
Aryzta is placing up to 4.25m new shares which will raise a prospective E150m. EPS guidance for 2012 is being 
maintained. The proceeds of the placing, it is stated, will be used to strengthen the balance sheet. Adjusted EPS 
guidance for FY 2012 of 338c is being maintained. Shares in the group plunged 260c to E35.20 in reaction to the 
dilution of existing shares.
Grafton has issued a 2011 trading update. The group has revealed that its revenues rose 2.5pc to E2.05bn in 2011 
and that the underlying trading profit result will be at the upper end of the E52-55m range guided back in November. 
It was announced there will be a E13m restructuring charge taken in the 2011 results, which is expected to yield an 
incremental benefit of E6m in 2012. There will also be a around E19m non-cash provision relating to onerous 
leases in the Irish DIY business. No specific comment was made on 2012 prospects. Shares in the group rose 5c to 
E2.55. Davy said that a joint venture with its 29.7pc shareholder, Farmer Business Developments, reduces FBD's

News analysis
Budget carriers and their full-service rivals are finding common ground, writes Rose Jacobs
Body
As New Year's resolutions go, EasyJet's is risky. Since its inception, the airline has embraced open seating, using 
the logic that competition for seats gets passengers aboard more quickly, producing faster turnround times which in 
turn help squeeze in more flights per aircraft.
But starting this spring, the low-cost carrier will begin a trial of assigned seating on flights .
EasyJet's scrappier rival, Ryanair, already reserves its choicest seats - in the front two rows and next to exits - for 
passengers willing to pay a surcharge. Ryanair emphasises, however, that the practice does not prolong its 25-
minute turnrounds.
If it did, reserved seating would be dropped, says Stephen MacNamara of Ryanair. "We would not put that 25 
minutes in jeopardy," he adds.
EasyJet, based at Luton airport, also insists it will back away from reserved seating should it damage turnround 
times. Yet its trials underscore a wider trend across commercial aviation - towards greater complexity.
While budget carriers creep toward the business models of traditional full-service airlines by developing premium 
products, the flag carriers are adopting some of the strategies employed by low-cost rivals , in particular by 
"unbundling" perks they once lumped into first-class or business-class fares.
That means passengers reluctant to pay for premium seats but keen to secure, say, free schedule changes or 
access to the first-class lounge can create bespoke seat classes by buying an economy ticket and adding the perks 
a la carte.
Airlines ditch simple model for complexity
For their part, airports are mirroring their airline customers , introducing premium offerings for every step from 
parking to check-in to security lines to border control. Geoff van Klaveren at Deutsche Bank says: "Airlines want 
that because when they ask people what they don't like about flying, it's not the time on the airplane, it's the hassle 
in the airports they really hate."
In some ways, greater complexity is a natural response to a slowdown in some parts of the industry. Global 
passenger numbers have risen by about 5 per cent a year during the past three decades, a trend that looks set to 
continue. Much of the growth, however, will come from developing countries, meaning that operators in mature 
markets need to work harder for returns.
When they do, passengers should benefit, in turn boosting investors' fortunes. However, there are risks associated 
with added complexity. Airlines have needed to invest in new selling strategies and partners, to make sure that 
travel agents - especially those dealing with lucrative business travellers - understand and consider unbundled 
ancillary services.
"It does add a layer of complexity but as long as the cost of providing the ancillary product is outweighed by the 
incremental revenue then I do think this strategy will be successful," says Mr van Klaveren.
EasyJet's seating project has already cost a few million pounds, for investment in IT, but analysts - while largely 
supportive - are more concerned about whether it might slow turnround times.
Jason Steffen, an astrophysicist at the Fermi laboratories in the US, conducted a number of experiments this year 
to investigate the factors that determine commercial aircraft boarding times.
He questions whether separating out travellers who are quick and efficient - the business travellers, say - from 
those who need more time necessarily improves operating efficiency. "It's like filling up a jar with rocks and sand. If 
you put all the sand in first, you can't fit in the rocks.
"In airports, if you put two slow people next to each other, they might slow each other down, whereas a fast person 
in their midst might speed them up," Mr Steffen adds.

Flybe plunges on fresh profit alert
Flybe plunges on fresh profit alert

Shares lose a fifth of their value
Decline in UK air travel hits sales
Body
Flybe shares lost a fifth of their value after Europe's biggest regional airline announced a fresh profit warning as a 
deteriorating UK travel market weighed on sales.
The group said a particularly difficult December helped create "a significant shortfall against our revenue 
expectations" in the three months to December 31, and warned it would not be able to make up for the miss in the 
final quarter of its financial year.
UK domestic air travel, which represents about 70 per cent of Flybe's business, had experienced a 6 per cent year-
on-year decline in the first half of the year, the company said. That had swollen to an 8 per cent year-on-year fall by 
the end of the third quarter.
"The UK domestic market is clearly challenging," said Jim French, Flybe's chief executive. "Under such 
circumstances I believe that maintaining volumes and growing market share at the expense of planned yield 
increases was the correct decision to protect the long-term potential of Flybe."
Shares in Flybe, which floated in late 2010 at a price of 295p, fell 21 per cent to close at 55p in London.
Investec, the airline's in-house broker, revised its full-year forecast to a pre-tax loss of £8.5m from a pre-tax profit of 
£6.4m.
Andrew Fitchie, an Investec analyst, said: "It's a tricky one - they are doing everything they can but when the tide is 
going out, it's going out. The revenues they've been getting are flat, but they need higher prices to offset higher fuel 
charges."
Flybe plunges on fresh profit alert
Last October, Flybe shares tumbled by more than one-third to a then record low of 65p after the company reported 
a significant slowdown in sales during September.
The following month, Flybe said it was cutting the number of flights it offered in the UK by 6 per cent during winter in 
response to slack demand and rising oil prices. Bigger rival Ryanair has also grounded aircraft this winter , 
prompted by higher fuel costs.
Mr French said the airline's move into continental Europe was "progressing well", with its Nordic joint venture 
trading in line with expectations.
  FT Comment 
Flybe consolidated its position as the market leader for UK domestic air travel this quarter, but slackening demand 
meant it did so while watching yields and revenues flatline.
It has some scope for further capacity reductions next year, and could well benefit from IAG's purchase of BMI 
British Midland, which might lead to reduced competition - giving it an opportunity to raise prices. Nor does its 
balance sheet spell trouble. But with profits set to move from black to red this year, investors seeking short-term lift 
should look elsewhere.

The ISEQ rose again this morning as positive economic news from the USA and China underpined world markets. 
With a steady Euro and good corporate results, European markets are enjoying a few days respite from recent 
turmoil.
The ISEQ rose 29 points in early trading to 2,961. Stocks across the board eased higher with Ryanair up 0.89pc to 
3.97 on positive aviation data from Flybe. The implications for Ryanair are examined by NCB below.
Flybe read through for Ryanair and easyJet
  Facts: Flybe's revenue grew c20pc in Q3 2011/12, driven by its entry into
Continental Europe through the Flybe Nordic joint venture. These figures, however, disguise the poor domestic UK 
figures.   Analysis: UK domestic revenue declined by 8pc in Q3 2011/12. Flybe UK maintained its yields at last 
year's levels, but did gain 2pts of market share highlighting the shrinking overall market for domestic UK flights.   
Clearly, this highlights the overall weakness of the UK consumer, but we would not be overly worried about the 
outlook for Ryanair and easyJet in the UK given it is primarily outbound business. Domestic flights face more 
competition from cars, trains and buses. Furthermore in recessions, consumer evidence suggests that consumers 
continue to take holidays abroad but just spend less when they get there and business abroad goes on. Seeing as 
easyJet and Ryanair are the lowest cost offering to many destinations we expect them to continue to push up prices 
while maintaining a gap with their other rivals.   Conclusion & Action: We continue to expect an extremely weak 
European environment in 2012, but we maintain our view that Ryanair and easyJet will be outperformers in this 
environment because of their low cost models and capacity discipline in the industry generally. Both airlines are 
cash generative and will have net cash by the end of 2012. NCB Stockbrokers

Ryanair today said it would open its 50th base (and first in Cyprus) at Paphos, Cyprus's third largest city in April of 
this year.
The Irish airline said it will base two aircraft there with 14 routes which will initially deliver over 600,000 passengers 
a year and sustain over 600 jobs with over 80 weekly flights as Ryanair invests over dollar 140 million at the airport.
Ryanair's Paphos routes will begin when the base opens in April 2012.
In Paphos today, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said: "Ryanair is delighted to announce Paphos as our 50th base with 
14 routes beginning in April next which go on sale on www.ryanair.com tomorrow. Cypriot consumers/visitors can 
now beat the recession and escape Cyprus Airways high fares by switching to Ryanair's lowest fares and our no 
fuel surcharge guarantee to 14 exciting destinations all over Europe including Germany, Italy and Sweden among 
others. Ryanair's 600,000 passengers p.a. will sustain up to 600 jobs in Paphos." Alfred Van der Meer, Hermes 
Airport Group Chief Executive, said: "This is a great vote of confidence in the potential of both the airport and our 
region from Europe's largest airline. Today's announcement will help create much needed jobs and tourism and 
shows that Ryanair shares our confidence in the tremendous opportunity for strong market growth at the airport." 
Ryanair also announced 19 new routes from Girona in Italy to Aarhus, Bydgoszcz, Cagliari, Cork, Doncaster, 
Dusseldorf, Gdansk, Ibiza, Knock, Krakow, Madrid, Malmo, Nador, Perugia, Poitiers, Skelleftea, Stockholm, 
Thessaloniki and Turku from March 2012. Ryanair's Girona based aircraft will grow from four to nine for summer 
2012, as its new routes (59 in total) increase its Girona traffic to 3m passengers a year, sustaining up to 3,000 jobs 
at the airport and in the Girona region.

economies. "We're in for a very difficult 2012," said John Whelan, chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association,

will put additional pressure on public expenditure cutbacks to ensure that debt to GDP benchmarks are adhered to. 
The Irish Times XXXX Activity is expected to return to the commercial property market in 2012, with values 
predicted to increase for the first time since 2008. However, transaction volumes will likely be constrained by debt 
financing for some years to come. While values have fallen each year since 2008, experts are now optimistic that 
2012 will mark a reversal of this trend, as measures such as the reduction in stamp duty for commercial property 
from 6pc to 2pc in last December's budget have an effect. "2011 marked the third consecutive year of market

The ISEQ rebounded from last week's losses this morning but investors were still wary that there has as yet been 
no resolution to the lingering eurozone debt crisis.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was up 28.77 points to 2,918.64.
The euro and stocks stabilised today after last week's sell-offs, but worries over Europe's banks and caution ahead 
of Italian and Spanish debt sales this week left riskier assets vulnerable to further losses. U.S. stock index futures 
also pointed to a mixed open for equities on Wall Street today. Attention was focused on a meeting between 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy later today, which is likely to keep 
pressure on the euro although market expectations of any new announcements are low.
Shares in C and C were flat at E2.93 after the latest Nielsen British off-trade data for December (four weeks to 
December 24th) showed a strong performance by the Irish group and in particular by the key Magners brand. For 
the most recent four-week period, Magners value sales in the UK cider market considerably outperformed the 
overall cider market: Magners +33.6pc year-on-year (yoy) versus cider market +16.4pc. Therefore, Magners gained 
significant value share for the month, having a 13.5pc share of the market for this four-week period versus 9pc in 
the previous four weeks. Magners performed well across all cider variants for the period. Magners specials are 
continuing to do well in the market and represented 6pc of total Magners sales for the month. Magners Pear 
showed an especially strong performance, +74pc in value for the month. Ryanair's market-leading position in the 
low-cost sector - it now has 49 bases - and industry-leading low costs leaves it very well placed, Davy Research 
said today. "With the competitive environment very weak, airport opportunities are abundant - look for example at 
recent base deals at Wroclaw, Palma, Baden Baden, Manchester and Billund." Shares in the airline jumped 15c to 
E3.89. ICG attended the Davy Equity Market Forum in New York on January 6th. ICG remains an attractive story 
with a modern ferry fleet and no major capex required, leading to very strong cash flow, Davy said. "Looking into 
ISEQ gains but euro debt fears linger ISEQ Up
2012, the RoRo market remains weak overall though ICG's Irish Ferries subsidiary continues to outperform. Some 
excess RoRo capacity removed in early 2011 (Dublin-Liverpool) helped the market and it is inevitable that weaker 
players will need to take out further capacity. Reductions in passenger market capacity by some operators for 
winter 2011/12 should help yields. These will be higher, largely paying for fuel. After successfully passing through 
E10m in higher fuel costs in 2010, ICG broadly passed through half of the E11-12m increase in 2011. Its aim is to 
fully pass through the cost increase in 2012. In line with historical practice and peers, it is unhedged for fuel." 
Shares in the group fell 2c to E14.68.

Body
Ireland West Airport Knock's latest traffic figures show that 2011 was the busiest year in its history.
In 2011, the annual number of passengers using the airport increased by over 65,000 passengers to 654,500 - an 
increase of 11pc on 2010.
The Airport predicts that the current economic conditions will continue to influence travel patterns in 2012 but that 
due to an expanded network of over 28 International destinations and the recent announcements of new Mainland 
European services to Barcelona, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Milan and Paris with Lufthansa and Ryanair the Airport 
expects to grow passenger levels by a further 9pc in 2012.
A recent independent study by Ernst and Young Economic Consultants states that the airport supports a total of 
914 jobs in the region with an overall economic contribution of E143m annually. The new services detailed above 
are alone expected to generate an additional tourism spend of over E23m for the region. Joe Gilmore, MD Ireland 
West Airport Knock said: "We are delighted to have had a record year in 2011 and whilst it was our busiest year 
ever, without doubt, 2012 will be a challenge for everyone in the region. We look forward to welcoming the 
thousands of European tourists to the West and North West of Ireland but more than ever we need the support of 
the trade and in particular key stakeholders at regional and national level as these new services will require even 
greater effort on all our behalf's to ensure they are a success and are maintained for the longer term."

ever, without doubt, 2012 will be a challenge for everyone in the region. We look forward to welcoming the 
thousands of European tourists to the West and North West of Ireland but more than ever we need the support of 
the trade and in particular key stakeholders at regional and national level as these new services will require even 
greater effort on all our behalf's to ensure they are a success and are maintained for the longer term."

Body
The ISEQ closed another volatile week in the red after a sustained post-Christmas rally fizzled out as the eurozone 
debt and banking crisis remains unresolved and despite some strong economic data from the US.
The index fell 2.65 points to 2,889.87.
Fear that a capital black hole is spreading over the euro zone's banking sector threatens to overshadow the first 
meeting in 2012 of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy next week to discuss 
the region's debt crisis. European banks technically have until Jan. 20 to say how they will raise the estimated E115 
billion of capital needed by the end of June to repair balance sheets devastated by the euro zone's sovereign debt 
crisis. But investors' nerves have become frayed after seeing Italian bank UniCredit forced to deeply discount a 
planned one-for-one equity rights issue, and calls for more details on how others plan to raise funds are set to grow.
U.S. stocks edged lower as investors were pulled in a tug-of-war between strong domestic data including a better 
than expected unemployment report and continued concerns about Europe's debt crisis. Ryanair and IAG reported 
December traffic statistics yesterday (January 5th) and easyJet reported December traffic statistics this morning. 
Ryanair reported December 2011 passenger volumes of 4.8m, down 5pc compared to December 2010. Load factor 
was 1pp lower at 79pc. Rival easyJet's traffic statistics for December 2010 were significantly impacted by the 
adverse weather, with 2,000 sectors cancelled in the month against 149 sectors cancelled in December 2011. 
Consequently, underlying passenger numbers (adjusting for disruption) were 4pc higher in December 2011, while 
underlying load factor was one percentage point up on last year. Reported traffic statistics show passengers carried 
was up 13.1pc in December 2011 and load factor was broadly stable at 85.6pc versus 85.8pc in December 2010. 
Ryanair's shares rose 6c to E3.74. Aer Lingus dipped 1c to E0.65. Shares in Irish drugs developer, Elan, rose 8c to 
E10.51. Included in Eli Lilly's group of some 12 late stage drug assets is solanezumab, a monoclonal antibody that 
binds to soluble amyloid proteins with the potential to delay the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). "In this 
ISEQ closes volatile week lower ISEQ Falls
regard, its mechanism of action is broadly similar to that of ELN/PFE/JNJ's Bapineuzumab, although we understand 
that its specific target location may be different," said Davy analyst, Jack Gorman. "Tysabri may retain the spotlight. 
BIIB presents at a major US investor conference next week and may update the market on end-year patient 
numbers for the product (it did so last year). Our forecast is for end-2011 patient numbers of 65,200, up from 
62,900 at the end of Q3." Shares in Smurfit Kappa rose 7c to E4.95. While there was no price tracker in the latest 
weekly publication from RISI - an international paper and packaging monitor - the commentary around pricing was 
of note. Following the already reported declines in European containerboard pricing in December (circa E20/tonne), 
the majority of RISI's contacts predict relative price stability in January, reflecting reduced stocks and unchanged 
packaging prices.

By 11:00, the ISEQ had gained 16.18 points to 2,908.70.
U.S. nonfarm payrolls may have risen by 150,000 in December, according to a survey. Hopes of an even stronger

added in December, while initial jobless claims dropped 15,000 in the latest week. "A strong number could give

My 10-year-old daughter no longer believes in fairies. Or so I thought until last month, when I asked her whether 
she still believed in Santa Claus. "Where do you think Christmas presents come from, Daddy?!" she replied.
I then experienced a distinct sense of déjà vu at the European Commission's first Innovation Convention in 
December. It was clear that everyone there loves science. José Manuel Barroso said both publicly and privately 
that he trusts science will in the end solve all our problems, from the current economic crisis to climate change. 
Science was unanimously referred to as the only reliable medicine for sorting out all our traumas and providing 
long-term growth. Such deep faith in science was remarkable, and my heart melted. But there was a catch. It was 
equally clear that policymakers perceive science as something abstract and remote, à la Santa.
The list of speakers at the forum implied that science has little to do with innovation. A couple of practising scientists 
were lost amid chief executives, entrepreneurs, heads of various councils, university presidents and science 
popularisers. The most entertaining speaker was Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, who shared his 
personal vision of innovation: coin-operated toilets and taxing overweight passengers. His antics were at least fun, 
and the one-man-advertising-agency did not hide his intention to promote the airline among potential customers.
Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, Cambridge university vice-chancellor, was the most reassuring about our economic future. 
He reminded the audience several times that he represented an 800-year-old institution. According to Sir Leszek, 
innovation will be fine, so long as everyone follows the model of his 800-year-old institution. Everyone applauded 
his positive attitude at the time of crisis.
Don Tapscott, author of Wikinomics, was the advertised star of the show. He explained to the audience that 
Boeing's Dreamliner - 20 per cent more fuel efficient than earlier models - is possible due to a new business model 
of web networking. He did not bother with such details as better engines and aerodynamics, and the use of new 
composite materials. His message was so well received that, watching the enthusiastic applause given to him by 
officials, I imagined them issuing a mandate that all Commission staff join Twitter and carry a second Blackberry.
Oh for a eurocrat who actually understands science
My own talk was a waste. I reminded the audience that without scientific discoveries there could be no new basic 
technologies and, without these, scope for innovation was limited. Eventually, we would end up in a great 
stagnation, if we are not there already. I also warned about the emerging technology crisis that stems from chronic 
underinvestment in basic sciences for the past 30 years. Amid other, more acute, crises this has gone unnoticed, 
because it takes decades for scientific discoveries to result in consumer products. Previously, science was high up 
governments' agenda because of external threats but, without them, calls for better funding are doomed to be 
ignored amid cries for lower taxes.
How far I was off the mark can be judged from the following anecdote. At a dinner table, European officials and 
science ministers were curious about my line of work. In 2010 I shared the Nobel prize for physics for my work on 
graphene, an exciting new material with a wide range of potential applications. But graphene was no good as a 
reference.
So, I explained that I was at the start of a long economic chain leading to more powerful computers and gadgets, 
which require smaller and faster transistors. To my surprise, the listeners were well informed. I should not worry - 
one interjected - Moore's law, which says that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, 
would take care of everything. I felt snubbed. I had no strength to explain that Moore's law is not a law of nature but 
an observation.
What is the moral of my journey? Karl Marx, who was a disastrous revolutionary but a good economist, once stated 
that every nation had the government it deserved. Judging from the Brussels convention, Europe has exactly the 
state of innovation that we deserve.

(ANSA) - JANUARY 6 -  Ryanair has blocked sales of tickets for flights from Turin from March 24.  The extension 
on the low cost company's contract with the Piedmont Region is due to expire between March and April. The news 
has caused some alarm in Turin over tourist flows during the Easter period and for the April 25 and first May 
holidays. Ryanair flies nine services to Caselle and is the second largest carrier with approx. 600,000 passengers 
transported during 2011.

RYANAIR suffered a five per cent drop in passenger numbers in December compared to last year, after it grounded 
up to 80 aircraft to offset higher fuel costs.
But the low-cost carrier's annual traffic has risen 5.1 per cent to 76.4m in spite of the bigger-than-usual stoppages.
Ryanair's load factor, a measure of how many available seats are paid for on its flights, slipped one percentage 
point to 79 per cent last month.
British Airways parent IAG fared better in December, with passenger numbers up 10 per cent to 3.88m after a boom 
in European and North American flights, as well as better weather conditions than last year.
IAG said traffic in 2011 rose 2.1 per cent overall, with a jump in passengers across the Americas offsetting a 12.5 
per cent tumble in UK and Spanish domestic flights.
Its cargo division also enjoyed a 6.4 per cent rise in annual revenues.

Passenger numbers flying Ryanair declined by 5pc in December compared to the same month a year earlier, its 
latest travel statistics show.
"As previously guided, Ryanair's 2011/12 winter traffic was expected to decline by around 5pc as we sit up to 80 
aircraft on the ground due to higher oil prices," spokesman, Stephen McNamara said.
The no-frills airline carried 4.8 million passengers in the month compared to five million in December of 2010.
It carried 76.4 million passengers on all of its routes in the 12 months to the end of December. The airline's load 
factor - an industry wide measure of how well carriers fill their aircraft - fell by 1pc last month to 79pc. The load 
factor for the full year 2010 stood at 82pc. Crude oil prices rose this week to a five week high as tensions between 
the US and Iran grew. Analysts say wholesale oil prices will likely remain above the USD 100 mark for much if not 
all of this year adding pressure to airlines' bottom lines. Ryanair has responded by cutting back Winter services on 
key routes, preferring to leave aircraft on the ground rather than using them at reduced capacity and eroding its 
load factor. Dublin shares analysts say this tactic will do Ryanair no harm and that it remains among the most 
profitable in the world. Davy Stockbrokers said that there is increasing chances that Ryanair will not be buying any 
more aircraft this year and will use its annual E1 billion-plus cash surplus to give cash back to its investors in the 
form of one-off dividends.

The euro area sovereign debt crisis has led to a collapse in consumer and business confidence and this will lead to 
a likely double-dip recession in 2012, according to a start of year report from Davy Research today.
The combination of weak domestic demand and slowing exports will likely slow 2012 UK and Irish GDP growth 
forecasts to below those experienced in 2011, it said.
It predicts that 2012 could be another year of earnings downgrades for key shares and that it will be difficult to 
achieve mid-single-digit percent top-line growth and double-digit profit growth for listed firms in this economic 
environment.
"In this environment, careful stock picking in defensive sectors is likely to be the key to outperforming the market," 
head of research, Barry Dixon said. "In absolute terms we like Kerry, Glanbia and Sudzucker but we believe that 
Holcim, ArcelorMittal and Air France KLM will struggle in 2012 but cash rich Ryanair is a good pich as it generates a 
billion euro a year and if it doesn't buy aircraft then investors can expect enhanced dividends," he said. As we enter 
a New Year, it is difficult to see how companies can achieve top-line growth that will drive improvements in 
profitability, the report said. "While we have become more positive on the outlook for the US relative to Europe, 
growth rates are likely to remain close to zero; in emerging markets, we believe that growth rates will continue to 
slow." "Yet consensus estimates for equity markets in both the US and Europe are assuming mid-single-digit 
revenue growth and over 10pc earnings growth in 2012. This also assumes that operating margins reach cycle high 
levels. We believe these forecasts are too optimistic and will likely decline during the year. In this environment, it will 
be difficult for the overall market to make progress, and stock picking will remain a critical skill in terms of 
generating positive absolute and relative returns."

Executive sales of company shares can affect their price, writes Alexandra Stevenson
Body
Eyebrows were raised in December when the finance and managing directors of Michael Page, the global 
recruitment company, sold more than £2m worth of shares weeks ahead of a profit warning that sent the shares 
plummeting.
When asked about the timing of the sales, Michael Page refused to comment, on the grounds that management 
personnel did not need to justify their actions.
But shareholders watch directors' dealings closely, taking them as a cue of how well a company is doing, and a "no 
comment" from management may exacerbate a potentially minor situation. News of the directors' dealings sent the 
share price down 3 per cent on the day, and 6 per cent by the end of the week.
"To investors it [director share disposals] is a reflection that the company is overvalued and that the share price is 
going to go down, or even more seriously that there is a bigger problem," says Brian Peart, chairman of the north-
east region of the UK Shareholders' Association.
In the UK there are rules concerning when directors can buy and sell shares of their company, covering closed 
periods before earnings and trading updates. But profit warnings do not fall under closed periods, raising the 
question of whether investors deserve to know more about the nature of director dealings rather than being taken 
by surprise by such announcements.
On November 17 and 18, Stephen Puckett, finance director of Michael Page, and his wife Amanda, sold more than 
594,000 shares at prices between 376p and 380p. They made more than £2.25m from the transactions. On 
Why director dealings trouble investors
November 15 and 16, Charles-Henri Dumon, who runs the company's businesses in Europe, South Africa and 
North America, sold 130,000 shares at prices between 365p and 369p.
Two weeks later, on December 5, Michael Page announced that a significant slowdown in growth rates would 
weigh on full-year profits. The news sent the share price falling more than 6 per cent over the week to 325.7p.
By contrast, when Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, recently disposed of 4m shares, or 7 per cent of 
his total holdings, and James Osborne, senior independent director at the airline, sold 500,000 shares, or 45 per 
cent of his holdings before bad news, shareholders reacted less.
The following Monday, Ryanair released an announcement that its winter traffic would drop 5 per cent. However, 
the news that seat sales had slipped had been flagged well in advance by Mr O'Leary and Ryanair, leaving the 
share price unchanged. Ryanair also declined to comment.
The well-publicised incident at Michael Page was not the first time directors have sold or bought shares in such 
circumstances, but it underscores an aspect of corporate dealings that investors have little say in and information 
about.
It also demonstrates the impact a director's share disposal may have on the company's market value when it 
comes, together with bad news, as a surprise to skittish investors.
William Claxton-Smith, who worked as a fund manager in the City of London for more than 30 years, says: 
"Certainly it is something that makes people very unhappy when it happens," adding that while there are often 
logical grounds for directors to diversify their funds, "directors need to be very careful and behave in a way that 
doesn't cause any problems".

Clive Carpenter, partner, global asset finance, Clifford Chance, passed away on December 29 due to illness, the 
law firm has confirmed. He is survived by his wife and two children.
"Clive was an outstanding asset finance practitioner who played a role in many of the firm's major aviation 
transactions," says a Clifford Chance spokesperson.
Carpenter joined Clifford Chance in 1981 and became partner in 1994. He specialised in banking, asset finance, 
and leasing for aircraft, ships, satellites and machinery. 
From 1995 through 2000, he managed the law firm's Asian asset finance practice in Hong Kong. He was based in 
Clifford Chance's Dubai office from 1983 to 1989 where he worked on Emirates' first-ever financing transaction.
Carpenter was based in the Hong Kong office from 1995 until 2000, before he was transferred to Clifford Chance's 
London office in 2000, where he remained until his passing.
More recently in July last year, Carpenter advised on the first ever Euro-denominated US Ex-Im Bank capital 
markets notes issuance. The notes, worth about (EURO)156 million, financed eight Boeing 737-800s for Ryanair. 
Carpenter also advised Citi on Ethiopian Airline's acquisition of five Boeing 777-200s, which included a commercial 
loan, a pre-delivery payment (PDP) facility and a US Ex-Im guaranteed loan. Airfinance Journal awarded the deal 
African Deal of the Year for 2010. 
Industry peers have described Carpenter as a major player, pioneer and one of the best practitioners in the field. 
"He will be greatly missed by his colleagues as well as his clients. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult 
time," says the Clifford Chance spokesperson.

Last year might be remembered as the year we gave optimism its last rights. We watched as the eurozone teetered 
and almost collapsed, and the dole queues lengthened. Tens of thousands of Irish people said goodbye to their 
families, knowing that the next time they see them, it would be in a grainy video image on the screen of their laptop. 
We sat stoically through the fifth austerity budget in a row and gritted our teeth against an almost relentless diet of 
media misery.
Small wonder that, according to a recent survey, 27 per cent of us expect 2012 to be even worse than last year.
But if our national sense of optimism is on life support, it's not dead yet.
Because 16 per cent of people in the same survey said they expected this year to be better than 2011, and a further 
16 per cent are looking forward to a 'brilliant' year. Take both those figures together and it means that almost one in 
three of us are looking on the bright side. Now that's more like it.
But if you are one of the struggling two thirds, here are some reasons which might help you pick yourself up, dust 
yourself down and start looking forward to the new year ahead.
**Euro 2012**
Squeeze the thumb and middle finger of your right hand together, and repeat after me, in the manner of someone 
attempting Paul McKenna-style self-hypnosis: Poland. Trap. The boys in Green. Beers. Ryanair same-day return 
flights. June 2012. Repeat the exercise as often as needed until your spirits start to lift. And if that doesn't work, or 
you simply hate soccer, move on down this list until you find something that does.
**The London Olympics**
Barely will we have time to draw breath after the mayhem of Euro 2012, when the Olympic games kick off in 
London on July 2 -- and run until August 12. But the date you need to get in your diary is June 6, when the torch will

touch down on our soil and take part in a brief ceremony in Dublin city centre as part of its 12,800 kilometre tour of 
more than 1,000 villages, towns and cities.
**American football comes to Dublin**
Those suffering post-Euro and Olympic stress disorder will get another fix on September 1. That's the date when 
two of the giants of college football will clash at the stadium formerly known as Lansdowne Road, when Navy take 
on the fighting Irish, Notre Dame. It's guaranteed to be a good show whether your passion is for sport or of an 
aesthetic nature. Meanwhile, Croke Park is competing with four major European cities to host an NFL regular 
season game in the next 12 months.
**City of Science**
Thirty thousand of the world's finest scientific minds will converge on Dublin in mid-July to take part in Europe's 
largest science conference, called the Euroscience Open Forum. Topics to be covered include synthetic biology, 
space science, the Large Hadron Collider and cosmology. For more see www.dublinscience2012.ie.
**Conquering space**
Excuse us while we go all Mr Spock for a moment, but there may never have been a more exciting moment in 
space exploration. This year will see the newest Mars rover land on the red planet. Called Curiosity, it will spend a 
Martian year roaming the red planet, collecting organic material, which will help determine if there was ever life on 
Mars.
This could also be the year that commercial space travel gets under way, following the opening of the world's first 
Spaceport, Virgin's SpaceShipTwo. Virgin is aiming to begin with one flight a week, possibly starting this year, but 
eventually wants to have two flights a day.
And as though that wasn't enough, we are likely to turn up other new potentially life-supporting planets, like the 
recently-discovered Kepler-22b. Though not everyone believes that's good news. As Stephen Hawking says: "I 
imagine [aliens] might exist in massive ships, having used up all the resources from their home planet. Such 
advanced aliens would perhaps become nomads, looking to conquer and colonise whatever planets they can reach 
. . . the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America.  
**Memorable gigs**
Oxegen 2012 is not to be -- but who cares? If you're not excited about The Boss's return visit to Dublin this summer, 
then you're bound to be getting giddy about the prospect of seeing The Stone Roses play live in the Phoenix Park 
on July 5.
**James Joyce**
Literary boffins have a whole other reason to be excited about 2012 -- copyright on James Joyce's Ulysses and 
other works published in his lifetime expired with the arrival of the new year. Expect a Bloomsday such as you've 
never seen before, with plans for a flash mob to perform from each of the 18 chapters in the novel -- along with 
'musical and dramatic' representations of Joyce's work.
**It's not the end of the world**
Well, it is if you're a believer in the 2012 phenomenon, which dictates that the end of the world will come on 
December 21, 2012 by means of a solar maximum, a passing asteroid, Earth's collision with a black hole -- or any 
many of other nasty ends, including killer solar flares, silly geomagnetic reversals or a falling out with a non-existent 
Planet X.
Off Message: reasons to be cheerful in 2012
Inconveniently for the doomsday merchants, though, Nasa came out last month to make an impromptu public 
service announcement in which it declared that "astronomers can say with certainty that there is no threatening star 
close enough to hurt Earth".
I think the point about end-of-the-world theories is that they tend to put everything else into perspective. Yes, we're 
all in a precarious financial situation, there aren't enough jobs and people are being forced to emigrate in large 
number. Yes, the wrong people are being made to pay for the eye-popping greed and arrogance of others. No, it's 
not fair, and there's no end in sight.
But it's not the end of the world. Babies will go on being born, people will still fall in love and walk on beaches and 
gaze at sunsets, and have a laugh over pints. Great novels will be written, beautiful art will be made, and bananas 
will go on striking every three-year-old as having endless comic potential. Life goes on. And so will we.
Happy new year!

Simon Rudd is managing director of Prue & Simons, a new family-run business selling pork products to the Irish 
market. Prue & Simons launched last October, selling a range of sausage, bacon and black and white pudding 
products. It is based in Co Offaly and employs three people.
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
I am the managing director of Prue & Simons Pork Products. As the company is still small, I am responsible for 
pretty much everything. This includes accounts, marketing, sales, ordering, making and receiving payments -- and 
anything else that needs sorting.
**What are your professional motivators?**
We are in the launch phase of Prue & Simons at the moment. It was originally established in 1985 by my mother 
and father under the brand name Rudds, but subsequently went into liquidation in 2004.
I am re-launching the business with my mother Pru. Our main aim is to build a structure within, and around, our 
business to enable growth in the future. For this, we need a more efficient structure than the original family firm.
**How would you describe your work style?**
I am hands-on in my own role, but comfortable delegating to others. I tend to trust that people can do a job until I'm 
proven wrong.
**What is the best decision you have made in business?**
It was the decision to start up Prue & Simons. There have been times in the past when I felt that re-launching the 
brand was the worst decision I had made, but now we are getting to where I want to see the business structurally.
**What is the most valuable lesson you have learned?**
Working Week
Be cautious in business and have a consistently good quality product.
**Who do you most admire in Irish industry?**
I admire Ryanair's Michael O'Leary. This view tends to change every time I have an issue with the airline, but I do 
like his honesty. A lot of large organisations are more focused on lip service -- telling the public what they think they 
want to hear -- than telling it like it is. O'Leary says what he means.
**What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?**
Irish business will continue to find it difficult in the months ahead, although I do believe that consumers are rallying 
around by buying Irish products and services when they can, so they can support jobs here.
Unfortunately, some businesses don't have the same degree of loyalty when it comes to sourcing from within the 
Irish market. I believe this could potentially have a detrimental effect on small businesses.
**What is your ultimate professional goal?**
I would love to build our brand nationally. I am confident our products have retained the same quality they had when 
they first hit supermarket shelves back in the 1980s. The majority of the Irish consumers value trusted brands, so I 
aim to build recognition in the market.

Shannon hive-off could result in pension deficit
Shannon hive-off could result in pension deficit

Shannon Airport could face an immediate pension deficit of EUR 44 million if it is separated from the Dublin Airport 
Authority group.
The figures, which were compiled by an industry expert, also show that the overall pension deficit of the main 
retirement scheme at Aer Lingus and the three state airports stood at EUR 722 million at the end of September, 
more than double the EUR 344 million deficit which was recorded at the end of March.
The new data estimates how much of this deficit can be allocated to Aer Lingus and to each of the three state 
airports individually.
Shannon's share of the retirement burden had risen to EUR 44 million by the end of September, from EUR 21 
million at the end of March.
Dublin Airport's share of the deficit stood at EUR 130 million at the end of September, compared to EUR 62 million 
at the end of March, while Cork's share rose from EUR 10 million to EUR 22 million in the period.
A total of EUR 52 million of the deficit related to former SR Technics workers at the end of September, double what 
it was six months previously.
The vast bulk of the pension deficit relates to Aer Lingus staff and pensioners, according to the data.
The airline accounted for EUR 474 million of the total at the end of September, up from EUR 226 million at the end 
of March. Its share of the pension deficit was EUR 119 million more than its market capitalisation on September 30, 
which stood at EUR 355 million at the time.
The data also shows that the number of active members contributing to the scheme continues to fall sharply. In 
March 2009, there were 5,808 active members in the scheme, but in the same month in 2011, this fell to 4,654.
Shannon hive-off could result in pension deficit
By contrast, there was a large increase in deferred members, with 5,314 in the scheme in March 2011, compared to 
3,955 in March 2009.
A resolution to the deficit crisis in the airport pension fund is complicated by the fact that it is a multi-employer 
scheme, according to a pensions expert with knowledge of the issue.
Aer Lingus is in the private sector, the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) is in the semi-state sector and SR Technics 
has ceased trading.
The Minister for Transport, Leo Varadkar, has indicated that he may separate Shannon Airport from the DAA group, 
a move that would further complicate the pension scheme, said the source.
Ryanair has threatened legal action against Aer Lingus if it makes any contribution towards the deficit.
The airline, as well as the DAA, has signalled that no additional funding will be aprovided to the scheme.
Under the rules of the scheme, no increase in either employee or employer contributions is possible without 
consent.

Heavy debt levels, rising competition and high fuel prices are taking their toll, writes Jan Cienski
Body
Captain Tadeusz Wrona became a Polish national hero last month after a successful emergency landing of his Lot 
Polish Airlines Boeing 767 without wheels at Warsaw airport after a landing equipment failure.
Now his chief executive, Marcin Pirog, is trying to achieve a less dramatic but also difficult rescue of the entire 
lossmaking airline.
"We have a difficult task, and we aren't being helped by external conditions," says Mr Pirog, who took over at the 
state-owned carrier last year.
Lot and neighbouring national airlines - CSA Czech Airlines and Malév Hungarian Airlines - are in a double bind.
First, their networks are too small to compete for long-distance traffic against big carriers such as Lufthansa, which 
draws large numbers of passengers from the region to its hubs in Frankfurt and Munich.
Second, they face fierce short-haul competition from low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Hungary's Wizz Air.
The region's airlines are saddled with debts and most are in the red, a consequence of high fuel prices and falling 
passenger numbers. Many have resorted to selling off subsidiaries, such as catering services, to have enough cash 
to continue operating.
Last year Lot carried about 5m passengers and posted a 52m zlotys ($15.3m) net loss.
This year appears to have been little better, since predictions for a 50m zlotys loss now look optimistic.
Rough ride for eastern European carriers
Malév generated an operating profit in October for the first time in years, having in 2010 posted a Ft24bn ($102m) 
loss on revenues of Ft90.8bn.
CSA lost $33m last year, but this was only a third of the loss it ran up in 2009.
Remaining on state life support indefinitely is not an option.
The European Commission is investigating Malév and CSA for allegedly benefiting from improper government aid, 
and the Hungarian carrier faces the possibility of repaying EUR332m.
Lot has been helped by selling its catering and airport service subsidiaries, which were bought by the state treasury 
for 230m zlotys.
But privatisation looks almost impossible amid the growing economic gloom . There is little interest from the three 
big European airlines - International Airlines Group (formed by the merger of British Airways and Iberia), Lufthansa 
and Air France-KLM - in buying any of the government stakes.
Lot is 94 per cent owned by the state; Malév was renationalised by the government last year after a short period as 
a private company; and an effort in 2009 to sell CSA failed, spurring the Czech government to embark on a deep 
restructuring of the airline.
The task of finding a buyer is not hopeless, according to Douglas McNeill, an airline analyst with Charles Stanley, 
the stockbroker.
Mr McNeill says the region's airlines retain valuable brands and can act as feeders for larger airlines, gathering 
passengers from their national markets and funnelling them to bigger hubs.
"However, it is certainly the case that there is not a lot of surplus cash around," he says.
What will be more difficult is carving out a niche as a hub carrier in their own right, though all three are trying to do 
so.
Mr Pirog's vision is for Lot to continue serving four North American destinations and to add about five in Asia 
beginning in 2012.
"The model we have chosen is to be an airline with a hub," he says, which would draw west Europeans for Asian 
flights and pull in passengers from central Europe for north American destinations.
Prague airport wants to be "a strategic hub between the eastern and western part of the world", says CSA, while 
Budapest aims, more realistically, to be a secondary hub for eastern Europe.
All three need to slim down and cut costs. The airlines are all moving to reduce the variety of aircraft they use in 
order to cut maintenance costs: Lot and Malév are opting for Boeing while CSA is shifting to Airbus   . They are 
dropping less profitable destinations.
Staff numbers are being cut, with CSA having cut its workforce by more than half in the past two years.
However, restructuring attempts are running into opposition from unions.
This month CSA pilots staged a one-day protest, objecting to a decision to move about a third of the fleet to a 
subsidiary that runs holiday charter flights.
"All the airlines in the CEE are facing the same challenges," says Mr Pirog, getting up to check his computer after 
being told that American Airlines' parent has just declared bankruptcy.
"Boy, this is a tough business," he says with a whistle as he stares at his screen.

Sales at the Shop & Collect service at Dublin Airport reached EUR 5 million for the year last week, double the figure 
for 2010.
Introduced by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) two years ago, the service allows passengers travelling within the 
EU to 'buy before they fly' and then collect purchases -- which are stored safely -- on their return to the airport. A 
collection reminder text message is also automatically sent to passengers when they land back in Dublin.
The service was designed to address the fact that some airlines, such as Ryanair, limit the number of bags 
departing passengers are allowed to carry on board the aircraft. Shop & Collect was extended to Shannon and Cork 
airports during the past year.
"This is our third year with the service at Dublin Airport and we have now doubled our volumes every year so far," 
said Paul Neeson, Aer Rianta Ireland's retail director.
"A quarter of all perfume sales to passengers travelling within the EU last week were made through Shop & Collect. 
Each passenger using the service spends an average of EUR 100, four times greater than the average spend of 
other passengers. Perfumes and cosmetics have traditionally been our best sellers, but we believe this service can 
be very attractive and convenient for purchasers of other products at the airport, such as wine and electrical goods."
Neeson said that retailers from airports across Europe had come to Dublin to see how the service operated. He 
said an indication of its success was the fact that sales to Ryanair passengers at Dublin Airport had increased by 
about 10 per cent since the introduction of the airline's one-bag rule, whereas airports of a comparable size 
elsewhere in Europe had seen the Ryanair spend fall by as much as 40 per cent.
The DAA is also developing a smart phone app for the Shop & Collect service, which will be available to download 
early next year.

What do Dilbert, David Brent and the Financial Times's Lucy Kellaway have in common? They are all dedicated to 
the absurdities and quirks of office life and internal corporate dynamics.
Vanity, ego, protocol, privilege: all these go hand-in-hand with the modern corporate set-up. Whether it's a battle for 
the corner office, watercooler chats or employee spats over who gets the best chair, the institutionalisation of 
company life is something that keeps HR departments busy all year.
But Dilbert might be confused at what is emerging at Vodafone's Irish headquarters in Leopardstown, Co Dublin.
Under the stewardship of its chief executive, Jeroen Hoencamp, the cellular behemoth has radically altered the 
concept of corporate workflow.
No executive -- including Hoencamp -- is allowed an office. Printers have been banished. Desk clutter, from 
binding-folders to chargers to personal knick-knacks, has also been banished. And food, from crisps to Pot 
Noodles, has been exorcised from desk life.
Brent would be bemused. But staff seem to like it. In place of sloppy desk lunches, there are new, state-of-the art, 
restaurants and cafes. Instead of overflowing, fire-hazard-grade cluttered desks, everyone has a locker in which to 
place their apparel.
And, in lieu of offices in which to hide, senior executives must now grab a seat -- and a laptop -- beside all the other 
staff in the organisation.
It's a radical move that, with the possible exception of Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, would be almost unthinkable for 
an Irish chief executive to initiate. Then again, Hoencamp isn't Irish.
Shaking up office politics
"The first thing I said to my PA when I arrived here was: 'Please don't ever bring me lunch'," said the Dutchman. 
"And why should she? Why shouldn't a chief executive be seen to go down to the restaurant or cafe and get his 
own lunch?"
The same rule was introduced for executive offices: get rid of them.
"What is the point of the corner office?" said Hoencamp. "That is just a way of hiding from staff. I sit somewhere 
different every day. That means that people I don't usually get to talk to sometimes strike up a conversation. That 
can only be good."
Instead of offices, Hoencamp and (soon) the rest of Vodafone's upper echelons now find a vacant space on the 
main workfloor and plonk themselves down with a laptop. "We have meeting rooms," he said. "But they have to be 
booked for a specific purpose."
And it's not just on the floor that a sense of equality has settled in. Executives, including Hoencamp, must come 
down to reception to meet any visitors or guests that arrive to see them. PAs are not allowed to perform this task on 
their behalf.
"It's a matter of respect to the person who has come to see you," said Hoencamp.
What would the FT's Kellaway make of this? Sitting at the same open-plan desk as a junior functionary? No custom 
drawers, bathrooms or seats? No stratified culture of "us" and "them" within the organisation?
What's the point of being a big executive at all?
"It's not about the creature comforts of executives," said Hoencamp. "It's about trying to make everyone feel a bit 
more comfortable and cutting out a lot of the nonsense. It's not particularly a Dutch thing, either. We're just trying to 
make people motivated in a way to give the kind of customer service that we say we'll give."
Hoencamp, a Formula 1 obsessive, has introduced other changes to the headquarters. There's a fully-stocked 
Vodafone shop in the lobby of the building. This is not to sell more stuff, but is aimed at fully familiarising staff with 
all of the products that the company actually sells.
And if staff want to tweet or update Facebook about it, they can: there are no anti-Facebook rules, no filters 
ensuring staff can't check their Twitter feeds.
"Look, if you're going to waste time, it'll soon become pretty apparent to whoever your manager is," said Hoencamp. 
"Show people a little trust. We trust people to get their work done in the time they have. Besides, it's not like you 
can stand behind someone all day looking at what they do."
He has a similar approach to chatting and "watercooler time".
"If people want to chat, they'll chat," he said. "We can't stop them, and it's unrealistic to think we can. If they get 
their work done, there's no problem."
One factor that cuts out a little wastage is a new anti-snacking rule. To say that Hoencamp is not a fan of Monster 
Munching at a desk is an understatement. "I'll admit it is a little neurotic," he said. "But, firstly, food adds to clutter. 
Secondly, sometimes it's disgusting. Not everyone likes the smell of a curry at their co-worker's desk."
Instead, each floor now has a decent food and cafe space. And there are two proper restaurants in the building.
What is the result of this new clutter-free, anti-snacking environment? Walking into the main Vodafone work floor is 
like entering a very large, very posh airport lounge. It's airy (one whole side of the floor has views down towards 
Dublin Bay), has plush carpet underfoot and has a sedate, comfortable hum. Instead of pods or offices or corridors, 
the whole floor is one open space with a series of modern tables around the room. Each table has a few power 
points and comfortable chairs. But there are no desktop computers, no printers and no personal silos of "stuff".
Shaking up office politics
Instead, laptops are the tool of choice. The end-result is a feeling of space and a distinct lack of typical office chaos.
Other than the restaurants and cafes, there are other designated spaces on each work floor to accommodate 
normal daily interventions.
A couple of mobile sound-proof sofa booths punctuate the large, main work floor for anyone who wants to make or 
take a personal mobile call. The sofa booths also have large TV monitors inside for the purpose of on-the-fly 
presentations.
The absence of printers was something that would take time for some people to adjust to, said Hoencamp.
"People might argue that they have important, sensitive documents, like a profit and loss account or important 
contracts," he said.
"Okay, there are some instances where paper is a part of work life. But it can get ridiculous. So many times I've 
seen desks with piles of papers falling off. When you clean it out, much of it will be years old and was just never 
tidied away."
In any event, the office is not entirely printer-free. "There is a single printer on each floor, but it's away at the end of 
the room," Hoencamp said. "If I can manage without having reams and reams of paper files and reports stuffed into 
drawers and spilling off desks, so can most of the employees here."
Times are tough in the telecoms industry. Spurred by ever-increasing competition and regulatory diktats, monthly 
bills for mobile customers continue to plummet. Vodafone is feeling this as much as any other player in the market: 
it had to let a number of staff go last year.
What's the prognosis for 2012?
"We're certainly not planning any more staff cuts," said Hoencamp. "Although you can never say that you're finished 
taking cost out of the company. But we've really turned the company around. We're probably the only operator that 
has come close to returning to growth in the market."
This workflow reorganisation, said Hoencamp, was part of a larger effort to re-focus productivity within the 
company.
"It's not a typically Dutch way of working. But the thinking did originate in the Netherlands. Now we're rolling it out in 
Britain. This is the way the world's going to go."

The main Dublin shares index rose for the sixth straight day today, albeit in thin Christmas trading, as the euro rose 
thanks to a better outlook for the US economy.
The index rose 28.60 points to 2,865.35.
European stocks rose to their highest in two weeks, tracking Wall Street gains as the world's biggest economy 
showed further signs of recovery, especially in the labour market.
However, volume was thin on the last session before Christmas and strategists warned against reading too much 
into movements in share prices. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.9 percent at 991.07 
points, the highest since Dec. 8, but volume was just 17 percent of the index's 90-day average, with the London 
Stock Exchange only trading for half a day. Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin said that the ECB's long-term liquidity 
operation for the euro-zone banking system was the biggest response to the crisis yet. "Following two consecutive 
rate cuts since his arrival as President in November, it appears that Mario Draghi has heralded a new, more 
aggressive, era for the ECB. We certainly hope so." "This week's 3-year liquidity operation saw a take-up of 
E489bn, with 523 banks taking part. The ECB will be pleased with both the large number of banks taking up the 
offer of liquidity, thus reducing the stigma attached with it, and the amount of take-up, thus reducing roll-over 
concerns for banks going into Q1 2012. The operation also improves the maturity position of funding in euro-zone 
banks, with reports suggesting that around E300bn of the total was rolled from shorter-term liquidity facilities in the 
ECB. Irish banks, which currently borrow E101bn from the ECB (E69bn of that being the covered banks) were likely 
to be big users of the facility, although no country breakdown has been provided by the ECB," said analyst, Dermot 
O'Leary. Irish-owned oil and gas exploration firm Providence Resources said it has increased its stake in the 
Barryroe licence off the south coast. Shares in the company were flat at E2.40. Fruit and vegetable importer Total 
Produce has increased its holding in the South African based Capespan group to 25pc. Its shares dipped 1c to 
Seasonal cheer, US data lifts ISEQ ISEQ Up
E0.38. Shares in Ryanair rose 5c to E3.76. The British government said it plans to ban companies from making 
their customers pay excessive credit and debit card surcharges when buying flights and other services. Firms will 
be allowed to add just a small charge to cover their actual costs. Payment surcharges are especially prevalent in 
the airline sector, where Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has estimated that British consumers spent 300 
million pounds on such fees in 2009. The European Union Consumer Rights Directive will ban businesses in many 
sectors, including airlines, from imposing above-cost surcharges on payments from mid-2014. The British 
government plans to consult on implementing this provision of the directive early, with the goal of banning above-
cost surcharges by the end of 2012. Irish airline Ryanair said its 6 pounds booking administration charge did not 
apply to all cards. "I would not expect the rules to affect us as we don't impose any debit or credit card fees. Our 
administration charge can be avoided using certain types of cards," said Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara.

the airline sector, where Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has estimated that British consumers spent 300 
million pounds on such fees in 2009. The European Union Consumer Rights Directive will ban businesses in many

The British government said today it plans to ban companies from making their customers pay excessive credit and

Payment surcharges are especially prevalent in the airline sector, where Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has 
estimated that British consumers spent 300 million pounds on such fees in 2009.
"We want to make sure that consumers paying by card do not have to pay excessively high surcharges being 
imposed on them by some airlines and other businesses," consumer minister Edward Davey said in a statement. 
The ban will apply to most retail sectors, not just the transport sector. The European Union Consumer Rights

payments from mid-2014. The British government plans to consult on implementing this provision of the directive

right. We need to make sure the right process is in place to help consumers challenge companies that levy 
excessive surcharges and we need to give business some time to get their systems ready," Treasury minister Mark 
Hoban told the BBC. Irish airline Ryanair said its 6 pounds booking administration charge did not apply to all cards. 
"I would not expect the rules to affect us as we don't impose any debit or credit card fees. Our administration charge

The British government said today it plans to ban companies from making their customers pay excessive credit and 
debit card surcharges when buying flights and other services.
Firms will be allowed to add just a small charge to cover their actual costs.
Payment surcharges are especially prevalent in the airline sector, where Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has 
estimated that British consumers spent 300 million pounds on such fees in 2009.
"We want to make sure that consumers paying by card do not have to pay excessively high surcharges being 
imposed on them by some airlines and other businesses," consumer minister Edward Davey said in a statement. 
The ban will apply to most retail sectors, not just the transport sector. The European Union Consumer Rights 
Directive will ban businesses in many sectors, including airlines, from imposing above-cost surcharges on 
payments from mid-2014. The British government plans to consult on implementing this provision of the directive 
early, with the goal of banning above-cost surcharges by the end of 2012. "We need to consult to get those rules 
right. We need to make sure the right process is in place to help consumers challenge companies that levy 
excessive surcharges and we need to give business some time to get their systems ready," Treasury minister Mark 
Hoban told the BBC. Irish airline Ryanair said its 6 pounds booking administration charge did not apply to all cards. 
"I would not expect the rules to affect us as we don't impose any debit or credit card fees. Our administration charge 
can be avoided using certain types of cards," said Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara. In June, the OFT 
called for the law to be updated to stop surcharges on debit card payments after consumer group Which? asked it 
to investigate. Which? said card surcharges were often sprung on the customer at the point of payment and could 
be much higher than the retailers' costs in processing the transaction. The consumer group singled out low-cost 
airlines, such as Ryanair and Britain's Flybe and easyJet, who it said charge fees per passenger, per leg of a

Airlines and online retailers are to be banned from levying "excessive" and opaque surcharges on card purchases 
next year, in a move being presented by the Treasury as a dose of Christmas cheer for struggling consumers.
Mark Hoban, Treasury minister, will announce today that excessive charges on all forms of payments - not just 
debit cards - would be banned by the end of next year and that it would extend across most retail sectors including 
transport.
"We want consumers to be able to shop around," he will say. "They have a right to understand the charges they 
may incur upfront and not be hit through a hidden last minute payments surcharge."
The move follows a campaign by Which?, the consumer organisation, which claims that airline passengers pay 
more than £265,000 a day in card surcharges. It says the Treasury's move represents a "huge victory for 
consumers".
The European Union is already making moves in that direction with a consumer rights directive that includes a ban 
on above-cost surcharges on any form of payment from mid-2014; Mr Hoban says Britain would lead the way and 
introduce the ban by the end of 2012.
"While the law will come into force at the end of 2012, we want companies to be upfront and fair over card charges 
today," said Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director.
Which? claims that it costs between 10p and 20p to process a debit card payment, but that airlines and retailers 
often then add a much greater charge on top. To compound the problem, the charge is sometimes not apparent 
until the very end of an online transaction.
The consumer group has singled out low-cost airlines for particular criticism. Ryanair, for example, charges a £6 
"administration fee" per person each way for the use of debit cards. It wants the Treasury to require retailers to tell 
Excessive charges on card payments near ban
consumers about any surcharges upfront "in plain language" and wants fees to match the actual cost to retailers or 
for retailers to absorb the "very small" cost of debit card transactions.
The Office of Fair Trading found in June that surcharging for the use of credit cards or debit cards was potentially 
misleading. Mr Hoban has endorsed the finding that the charges were "opaque, misleading and prevent customers 
from getting a good deal".
But the Treasury declined to speculate on whether the move would end up saving consumers large amounts of 
money, not least if retailers and airlines remove the surcharges and add them to the price of the item.

SIR RICHARD Branson was left fuming yesterday after British Airways parent IAG pipped Virgin Atlantic to a deal to 
buy BMI for £172.5m.
Branson said IAG's purchase of the loss-making airline "simply cuts consumer choice and screws the travelling 
public.
"BA is already dominant at Heathrow and their removal of BMI just tightens their stranglehold at the world's busiest 
international airport."
Virgin said it will ask competition bodies to look at blocking the deal. But analysts at Oriel said "the balance of 
probabilities is in favour of this [deal] being given the go-ahead".
But budget carrier Ryanair said the sale was "a logical development in the consolidation of Europe's major airlines", 
venturing to contrast the deal with its own bid for Aer Lingus, which was stymied by competition concerns.
BMI, formerly British Midland, controls around nine per cent of the landing slots at close-to-capacity Heathrow. 
Virgin has three per cent, while IAG will control around 53 per cent after the deal.
Virgin waded back into BMI owner Lufthansa's auction two weeks ago, offering less money but a deal it said would 
be better for competition.
But IAG yesterday tied up a binding agreement some three months before Lufthansa's target date for a sale, 
winning 56 daily take-off and landing slots while getting Lufthansa to keep BMI's defined benefit pensions liabilities.
Virgin vows to fight on as BA wins BMI TRANSPORT
IAG said it would restructure the firm over three years, with job losses expected, though costs linked to the overhaul 
will be less than the £153m a year currently lost by BMI.
Group chief Willie Walsh said IAG's plans to use the new slots for longhaul routes will make Britain "better able to 
compete on a global scale".
Lufthansa still has the option to sell BMI Regional and BMI Baby, as IAG has no plans to continue the brands.

The main Dublin shares index broke through the 2,800 mark after the ECB opened its first-ever offer of three-year 
loans, encouraging demand for stocks on hopes the funding will ease the debt crisis.
The ISEQ index rose 27.39 points to 2,810.19.
Banks took E489 billion at the ECB offering, sparking hopes the money may be used to buy Italian and Spanish 
debt.
Shares in CRH jumped 47c to E14.50. US housing starts rose 24pc year-on-year (yoy) to 685,000, in November 
well ahead of the street's target of 635,000. The improvement was again driven by multi-family starts which rose 
145pc yoy. This increase is being driven by a move to renting among potential US homeowners who struggle for 
financing or are reluctant to buy given the collapse in house prices in recent years. Housing permits also increased 
sharply, rising 21pc yoy in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 681,000. This was well ahead of 
consensus forecasts of 635,000. Multi-family permits were responsible for the sharp increase, rising 71pc yoy to 
246,000. The decline in residential property prices of 1.5pc on the month in November represents a 15.6pc fall on 
November 2010. The November decline follows a 2.2pc decline in October and a 1.5pc fall in September. In Dublin, 
prices fell by 1.4pc on the month and by 17.6pc on November 2010. Residential property prices in Dublin have now 
fallen 53.8pc from their 2007 peak. Outside of the capital, prices have fallen by 42.5pc overall. Shares in Kingspan 
climbed 30c to E6.40. Shares in Aer Lingus were flat at E0.65. Reports say that traffic over the Christmas period to 
early January is likely to be up 10pc yoy. The main contributing factor has been more favourable weather 
conditions. Goodbody's estimates for traffic at Aer Lingus called for relatively flat traffic in the final month (stats due 
in early January for December) after the reasonably strong figures in November (+7pc). "Another good month could 
add a few more passengers to the final tally, providing a nice little Christmas stocking filler to our E40m operating 
profit estimate for the full year. Ireland only accounts for about 8pc of capacity at Ryanair, so any small yoy boost

over this period is unlikely to move any dials at the pan-European LCC," the broker said. Ryanair's shares edged 
down 3c to E3.77. Both Gereral Mills and ConAgra referred to rising input cost pressures as a feature in its 
quarterly results yesterday. General Mills' adjusted eps was in-line with a year ago, but lagged expectations by 4pc. 
Its total revenue increased by 14pc, most of which (8pc) was accounted for by the Yoplait acquisition, while 
underlying volume growth was muted. Gross margins fell 570bps to 34.5pc, again driven by the Yoplait deal, though 
some relates to higher input costs. Of interest to Aryzta was the fact that its Bakeries and Foodserice division saw 
revenue increase by 12pc, including 3pc from volumes. ConAgra, meanwhile, reported a 15pc fall in net income, 
again citing higher costs and stating it was cautious about business conditions. While earnings per share was 11pc 
below last year, it was slightly ahead of expectations. Shares in Aryzta fell 75c to E35.55.

early January is likely to be up 10pc yoy. The main contributing factor has been more favourable weather 
conditions. Goodbody's estimates for traffic at Aer Lingus called for relatively flat traffic in the final month (stats due 
in early January for December) after the reasonably strong figures in November (+7pc). "Another good month could 
add a few more passengers to the final tally, providing a nice little Christmas stocking filler to our E40m operating 
profit estimate for the full year. Ireland only accounts for about 8pc of capacity at Ryanair, so any small yoy boost

over this period is unlikely to move any dials at the pan-European LCC," the broker said. Ryanair's shares edged 
down 3c to E3.77. Both Gereral Mills and ConAgra referred to rising input cost pressures as a feature in its 
quarterly results yesterday. General Mills' adjusted eps was in-line with a year ago, but lagged expectations by 4pc. 
Its total revenue increased by 14pc, most of which (8pc) was accounted for by the Yoplait acquisition, while 
underlying volume growth was muted. Gross margins fell 570bps to 34.5pc, again driven by the Yoplait deal, though 
some relates to higher input costs. Of interest to Aryzta was the fact that its Bakeries and Foodserice division saw 
revenue increase by 12pc, including 3pc from volumes. ConAgra, meanwhile, reported a 15pc fall in net income, 
again citing higher costs and stating it was cautious about business conditions. While earnings per share was 11pc 
below last year, it was slightly ahead of expectations. Shares in Aryzta fell 75c to E35.55.

Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China has, in recent months, received a slew of orders and commitments for its 
in-development C919, bringing its total order backlog for the narrowbody to 215. It has seen a steady growth in its 
order backlog in the past 12 months, the most recent being a purchase agreement on 9 December for 20 aircraft 
from China Aircraft Leasing Company.
This time last year, Comac had only 100 orders booked for the twinjet, generating questions over the programme's 
viability, particularly given its stated aim of taking on Airbus and Boeing in the 160-seat narrowbody segment.
Although the backlog looks healthier, the majority of orders and commitments are from the Chinese market, leading 
to concerns about the orderbook's robustness. However, Chris Seymour, an analyst at Flightglobal's Ascend data 
and consultancy business, said the C919 still has strong prospects. "Although the initial customers are Chinese 
leasing companies and airlines, we expected that. It's where the type will be proven," he said.
In a recent 20-year forecast, Comac said China's fleet will be 5,367 aircraft by 2030, up from 1,616 in 2010, 
accounting for 15% of the world's airliners. Its target is to grab one-third of the domestic market in the next 20 
years.
However, it is looking beyond China's borders as well. Low-cost carrier Ryanair has already expressed an interest 
in the C919, and Seymour is upbeat on its international prospects. "I'm sure it will attract Western orders before it 
enters service," he said.
He pointed to the strong Western contribution to the project, including Rockwell Collins avionics and Nexcelle 
nacelles and exhaust system. The C919 is also powered by the CFM International Leap-1C - a variant of the engine 
that will appear on both the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max. Comac is progressing with the development of 
the aircraft in a bid to meet the target of first flight by 2014. A review committee recently concluded the preliminary 
design phase of the aircraft after studying its overall structural strength, technology and avionics.

The joint definition phase has also been completed and the C919 has moved to the detailed design phase. After 
this, the aircraft will undergo testing before batch production begins, said Comac.
"Components for the nose and fuselage of the aircraft will be produced soon," it added, also hinting that more 
orders are in the pipeline.
Comac has much to do to meet the 2014 target. The C919 will also face many safety certification hurdles before it 
gets the nod to fly internationally. The manufacturer, however, has repeatedly expressed confidence in its schedule.
Also of note is the potential collaboration with Bombardier over areas of commonality between its CSeries aircraft - 
which currently has 133 orders - and the C919.
Bombardier president and chief executive Pierre Beaudoin said on 1 December that it had identified five areas of 
commonality between the two programmes. He said: "Our customers are telling us that it's a good idea to work on 
areas of commonality because it makes life simpler for them."

it was planning to shut its mill from December 23rd to the beginning of January. "While this is not unusual - most 
containerboard producers tend to shut over the holiday period for maintenance - the commentary is interesting. 
Varel states that the closure is due to "lower demand in the packaging business.as well as the still existing over

Shannon to focus on routes to Europe
Shannon to focus on routes to Europe

Management at Shannon Airport are liaising with a number of airlines in France, Germany, Italy and Spain in a bid 
to bring more point-to-point services to the airport.
They believe that routes served by a range of national carriers, instead of dominant players like Ryanair, would 
bring a better distribution of services to the mid-west hub.
An incentive fund has also been set up by Shannon Development in a bid to lure these carriers in.
This will be used in several ways, including underwriting routes, risk-sharing in relation to seat capacity and co-
operative marketing.
Public and private sector companies have contributed to the fund, which Shannon Development hopes to grow 
throughout 2012.
Vincent Cunnane, chief executive of Shannon Development, said that while the British and US markets were well 
serviced at Shannon, there needed to be a focus on more direct European routes.
Ryanair has reduced traffic to Shannon significantly over the last two years. The number of Ryanair passengers at 
the airport dropped from 2.7 million in 2009 to 1.6 million in 2010 after airport management refused to halve fees 
and charges.
The Shannon to Paris route was dropped late last year when fees increased by 33 per cent.
Cunnane said the new fund was a means for the region to contribute to the increased viability of the airport.
"The country is operating in a very changed environment, and that is why we need to look at incentive schemes for 
increased capacity at Shannon," Cunnane said.
Shannon to focus on routes to Europe
"The function of this fund would be to focus on more European routes and having sustainable routes from countries 
like Germany and France. Flights from destinations like Italy and Spain are currently only charter services, not 
scheduled ones.
"We have fund commitments from public and private sector companies that we are not announcing yet, and we 
have also increased tourist targets in the region by 600,000 through a range of initiatives."
Last week, it was revealed that a Booz & Company consultancy report that had been compiled for the Department 
of Transport had recommended that Shannon Airport should be removed from the control of the Dublin Airport 
Authority (DAA) and run as a separate, more business-oriented facility.
The report said the airport should be managed by a special operator in conjunction with local authorities and 
agencies such as Shannon Development.
Cunnane said that management at the airport had been advocating independence for Shannon "for some time. It 
would be relatively low risk and allow Shannon to realise its latent potential".

Norwegian discount airline in it for the long haul
Norwegian discount airline in it for the long haul

Body
Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA aims to become the first European discount carrier to launch long-haul operations, with 
flights to New York and Bangkok scheduled to start in early 2013, the company's chief executive said Friday.
In the same way that low-cost carriers, including Ryanair, EasyJet and Norwegian, have put other airlines under 
pressure within Europe "we're going to see the same shift in long haul," CEO Bjoern Kjos, a former fighter pilot, told 
The Associated Press in an interview.
Norwegian one of Europe's fastest-growing airlines has ordered six Boeing 787 Dreamliners for its planned 
intercontinental operations. Kjos noted that Malaysian budget carrier Air Asia X already has long-haul flights from 
Kuala Lumpur to European destinations.
"In 10-15 years, the number of passengers flying from the East to Europe will be significantly larger than that the 
total number of passengers flying within Europe," Kjos told AP at Arlanda Airport, one of Norwegian's four Nordic 
hubs.
"Our future competition will be the Asian companies," he said.
Kjos owns 27 percent of Norwegian, founded in 1993 and listed on the Oslo stock exchange 10 years later. After 
struggling to make a profit in its early years, Norwegian bought competitor FlyNordic from Finnair in 2007 and 
ordered 42 new Boeing 737 planes, lowering fuel and maintenance costs, which Kos said has been key to keeping 
prices down.
Norwegian is now the No. 2 airline in Scandinavia, and aggressively challenging tri-nation carrier SAS, the market 
leader, rather than trying to compete with other low-cost airlines.
"They are an old company that was created in a time when you didn't have to think about costs, you just raised 
ticket prices," said Kjos, who writes spy novels in his spare time. "It's much easier to compete with SAS than 
Ryanair."
Norwegian discount airline in it for the long haul
SAS chief commercial officer Robin Kamark noted the airline trimmed costs in a savings program that helped it offer 
better rates while returning to profitability last year.
"We have very good prices and customers are obviously very happy," Kamark said. "We listen to our customers 
and not what Bjoern Kjos says about SAS."
About Norwegian's planned long-haul flights, Kamark noted it was a "totally different game" than what the budget 
carrier was used to. "We wish them welcome to the market," he said. "SAS will be well prepared for the 
competition."
Unlike Ryanair, Norwegian has been trying to slash costs without cutting as many services. Norwegian flights have 
designated seating, and about half the planes in the fleet even offer wireless Internet access for free.
Kjos said Norwegian would be able to offer low fares on long-haul flights because of the lower operational costs of 
the new Dreamliner aircraft. Unlike a legacy carrier, on a Norwegian flight there will hardly be any difference 
between flying business class and economy class, he said.
"There will be wider seats for those who want to pay more, but there will be no real difference in flying business; the 
seat will be the only difference," he said.
Before becoming a lawyer and businessman, Kjos flew fighter jets in Norway's Air Force during the Cold War. He 
said the experience of intercepting Soviet warplanes nearing Norwegian air space helped him develop an ability to 
"evaluate risk" a skill he's found useful in business ventures.
Norwegian's fleet has grown from 14 aircraft in 2005 to more than 60 this year. Last year, the airline flew about 13 
million passengers, while SAS flew nearly twice as many.
The gap is expected to narrow this year, and even more so in 2012. Norwegian last month announced it would 
launch 34 new European routes starting in March next year.

The ISEQ followed most of Europe's share indices lower this morning after Italy paid record high yields at a bond 
auction and amid disappointment that the US Fed won't do more to boost the US economy.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen 12.12 points to 2,710.42.
Stock markets and the euro fell, worried by record high borrowing costs for Italy and the Federal Reserve's decision 
to do nothing new to prop up growth despite warning Europe's debt crisis could hurt the U.S. economy. The euro 
broke 11-month lows versus the dollar below dollar 1.30 after Rome's auction of five-year debt, with foreign 
exchange markets still speculating that more rating downgrades were in prospect for euro zone governments. Italy 
paid a euro era record 6.47 percent on its new five-year bonds, compared with the previous record of 6.3 percent 
set in November. Financial markets have been sliding since the start of the week as investors came to the 
conclusion that measures agreed at last week's EU leaders summit did not go far enough to resolve the two-year-
old debt crisis.
Smurfit Kappa's shares fell 5c to E4.25 after it announced plans to spend SEK 540m (about E59m) to upgrade its 
kraftliner plant in Pitea, Sweden. This move will increase overall capacity at the plant by 55,000 tonnes from 
360,000 tonnes currently to 415,000 tonnes. It will also result in a greater capacity in higher-value, white-top 
kraftliner. "While sentiment towards the sector remains weak, there is underlying value in the stocks. The market 
will need to gain confidence, however, that earnings estimates have troughed before there is a meaningful re-
rating," said Davy's Barry Dixon. Ryanair has announced that it will open its 49th EU base at Palma in March 2012 
with four based aircraft operating 47 routes (17 new). It will compete with Air Berlin (which has been pulling winter 
capacity there) and Air Europa. Separately, it has announced the cutting by up to 50pc of Alicante's summer 2012 
schedule of six based aircraft due to the airport compelling Ryanair to use airbridges at a cost of around E2m per 
annum. Shares in the airline fell 6c to E3.73 while Aer lingus dropped 2c to E0.66. Paddy Power has signed a three

Shares in Dublin have slipped back this morning as markets globally continue to be hit by downbeat news on the 
euro crisis.
German leader Angela Merkel has dampened spirits by sticking with her opposition to any rise in the firepower of 
the ESM bailout fund.
The ISEQ index was down 14.72 points a short time ago, more than wiping out yesterday's tentative gain of 11.40 
points.
Markets across Europe are similarly down today. Among the main names on the Dublin market, CRH is down by 
12c to 1352, Elan has dropped by 18c to 856, Glanbia has shed 6c to 440 and Ryanair is off 2 c to 377. Not all

News In Brief
## A new Irish pound would probably rise against other currencies, not fall, with Ireland appearing to be the most 
competitive of Europe's troubled economies, research by Bank of America analysts has found. Their study reveals 
a huge difference between Ireland and the other pressurised economies of Italy, Portugal and Spain - which would 
need devaluations of 11pc, 14pc and 20pc respectively against the dollar to restore lost competitiveness. But the 
Irish economy could take a 9pc rise in the value of the euro against the dollar before its competitive position was 
"fair value", currency analysts Richard Cochinos and David Grad say. Only three of the countries studied would 
have under-valued national currencies - Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland - and the notional Irish punt would 
be the cheapest. A French franc would be 7pc over-valued. - Irish Independent
## Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance, the body that insures State bodies and local authorities, including the HSE, 
may have its credit rating downgraded by Standard and Poor's. The ratings agency has put the ratings of 15 
European firms, including top insurers Aviva and Alliance, on negative watch due to the euro zone debt crisis. The 
move was linked to the agency's warning last week that it may downgrade 15 euro zone countries' sovereign debt, 
it said. RSA Insurance Ireland was also named by the ratings agency. Irish Public Bodies insures most local 
authorities and county councils and is owned by its members. It currently has a triple-B rating with Standard and 
Poor's. - Irish Times
## Vets who carry out inspections in meat factories around the country are to start a work-to-rule today in a row 
over proposals to give some of their work to technical agricultural officers. However, the action is not expected to 
significantly affect supplies of meat in the run up to Christmas. The Veterinary Council of Ireland, which represents 
the vets, is in dispute with the Department of Agriculture over the plan to cut costs by replacing temporary vets with 
lower paid officials. - RTE ## Ryanair chairman David Bonderman and his family sold 14.5m euros worth of shares

in the low-cost airline last week. It was the largest sale of any shares in an Irish listed company by a board member 
so far this year. Bonderman who heads up the 40bn euro TPG private equity giant retains 9.23m shares worth 33m 
euros . The shares were sold by the Bonderman children's trust on December 2. - Sunday Independent ## Up to 30 
medical sales jobs are to go at Pfizer's Irish operations, as the company prepares for one of its key products, 
Lipitor, coming off patent in Europe next summer. The cholesterol-lowering drug - the largest selling prescription 
drug in history - came off patent in the US at the end of last month. Redundancies are to start in January. - Irish 
Times ## Millionaire businessman and 'The Apprentice' star Bill Cullen is licking his wounds after suffering a 
substantial loss following the closure of his exclusive rehab clinic. Brian Purcell, the car dealer tycoon's spokesman, 
refused to say how much he lost when The Forest residential treatment centre went into liquidation earlier this 
month. However, it's understood that Mr Cullen is one of the biggest creditors owed money following the demise of 
Forest Healthcare. He confirmed that Mr Cullen was unhappy that the luxury treatment centre was operating at a 
loss over the past three years. "It's been very disappointing," Mr Purcell told the Irish Independent last night. The 
centre, based near Glendalough in Co Wicklow, catered to wealthy clients with drug and alcohol addictions and 
other problems. - Irish Independent ## The luxury Swiss property owned by businesswoman Sarah Newman, which 
was at the centre of an AIB case against Ms Newman and DJ Carey, has been sold. AIB indicated that it was to 
move against the property last May after the bank was awarded judgment of 9m euros against Ms Newman and her 
partner, former Kilkenny hurling star Mr Carey, arising from loans, and guarantees they had given for each other's 
loans. Chalet Grace, which is named after Ms Newman's daughter, was for sale for 15 million Swiss francs (12.1m 
euros). - Irish Times ## A receiver appointed to the former flagship firm of property developer, Bernard McNamara 
has realised over 3.1m euros from the sale of assets of the company, new documents show. NAMA moved in 
November last year to appoint Declan Taite of RSM Farrell Grant Sparks as receiver to Michael McNamara & Co. 
After being appointed receiver, Mr Taite shut down the company's sites and laid off half of its 110 staff. A receiver's

Shares in Dublin have fallen back this morning as investors shake off the brief burst of optimism they felt after the 
EU summit.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 13.74 points a short time ago aT 2,727.55.
The drop is in line with a similar retreat on other markets across Europe as the failure of the summit to adequately 
address sovereign debt issues weighs.
This morning's drop has nearly wiped out the 20.34 points rise seen in Dublin on Friday. CRH was down 22c for the 
session at 1328 a short time ago, with DCC off by 27c to 1822, with Ryanair dropping by 3c to 381. Not all big 
names were down, howwver. Glanbia has risen by 2c to 439 and Kerry Group has gained 14c to 2824.

Ryanair and the Generalitat of Catalonia have reached a tentative agreement that the Irish low-cost airline will 
receive around 8m euros each year for the next five years (40m euros in total) in exchange for continuing to operate 
at the airports of Girona and Reus, according to reports in the Catalan media.
Specifically, the airline is committed to maintain three million passengers a year in Gerona and a half million in 
Reus.
Both figures are far from the over seven million passengers carried by Ryanair in 2009, before there was a change 
of strategy in Catalonia, which has given priority to its operation at the airport of El Prat in Barcelona.
The draft agreement, however, will only be ratified if Aena (the public company that owns both facilities) agrees not 
to raise rates at these two airports, because otherwise "the draft agreements will be cancelled". The tentative 
agreement comes just 15 days after Ryanair operated its last flight from Reus airport. In the last year it has 
cancelled 39 flights from Girona airport which, for the last decade, has been its main base of operations in Spain.

FAMILIES are most likely to be affected by Ryanair's hiked prices next year as the Irish airline prepares to increase 
charges for many of its passenger services as of 15 December. Under the new rules, a 15kg bag checked in at the 
airport, without being pre-booked, will cost the customer £100 in peak season (June to September and Christmas) - 
an increase of 150 per cent on the current charge of £40.
Checking in a second 15kg bag that wasn't booked ahead will incur the highest new cost of £135.
Printing a ticket at the airport will set the traveller back £60 per boarding card in a 50 per cent rise on the current 
price.
The airline claims to be changing the way passengers think about their journey, incentivising them to travel light and 
offering tailored options.
Stephen McNamara, a spokesperson for the airline, said, "Over 70 per cent of Ryanair passengers will be 
unaffected by these changes as they already travel with no checked-in bags."
Ryanair has come under fire in recent years for its alleged proposals to cut costs, such as levying an extra fine on 
overweight passengers, making passengers carry their own luggage to the plane and charging passengers to use 
the aircraft's toilets.

Ryanair has changed tack in its battle with Aer Lingus over the Irish flag-carrier's pension scheme, dropping 
demands for an emergency shareholder meeting but threatening legal action should the group, in which it is the 
largest shareholder, agree to help cover the EUR500m deficit.
Accepting defeat in a   month-long fight for an emergency general meeting, waged through open letters to Aer 
Lingus's board, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, blamed Irish company law, saying shareholders cannot 
compel the board to hold an EGM.
"The only remedy you have is to hold the EGM yourself, and then they can ignore whatever resolutions are passed 
at that EGM. Welcome to Ireland. That's why we're bankrupt."
The low-cost carrier, which holds a 29.8 per cent stake in its Dublin-based rival, wants two things of Aer Lingus's 
board: access to a company-commissioned report on a redundancy scheme that led to a EUR30m fine by Ireland's 
inland revenue; and assurances that the group will not make any further payments into a defined-benefit pension 
scheme that was changed to a defined-contribution plan at the time of the airline's 2006 stock market flotation .
Aer Lingus yesterday welcomed the decision to drop the EGM request.

David Bonderman completed a hat-trick of directors exiting shares in Ryanair Holdings last week when he 
announced the sale of a third of his shareholding on Wednesday.
The airline chairman sold a £12m stake last Friday, joining Michael O'Leary, chief executive, in parting with 4m 
shares, a tranche which represented one in 14 of the shares held by O'Leary who continues to own a 3.5 per cent 
stake in the business.
Traders sent shares lower that day as the discount carrier announced weaker passenger numbers for November, 
although having cut routes the airline maintains an 80 per cent load factor meaning that four of every five seats is 
still occupied. James Osborne was also a seller the day before, cutting his stake in half having sold at a similar 
price a year ago.
After a Monday recovery from Friday's weakness, traders gave a muted response to the disposals.
Neil Goulden bought into pub chain Marstons for the first time in three years last Thursday, with shares in 
recovery mode. Last month, the company reported results ahead as footfall among its 2,000 pubs increased this 
year in spite of the economic gloom.
A former executive at Compass and Ladbrokes, Goulden joined Marstons in 2008, but waited six months before 
making his debut trade as shares were tumbling. They are down a further 20 per cent since, and hit an 86p low six 
weeks ago.
Elsewhere in the leisure sector, Ian Hogg bought into Sportech after a period of stability for the shares, which are 
now unchanged since three directors stoked up their holding in March.
The 37p trades sparked a bull run that boosted the shares 25 per cent in six weeks but the gains proved short lived 
losing all the gains in the month that followed. The company was among the final bidders for the Tote earlier this

year when the government disposed of the state bookie but fell away at the last in a race eventually won by rival 
Betfred.

The ISEQ bounced back today to close a week of choppy trading higher, following an overnight agreement by 
European leaders for tighter euro zone budget rules.
The index rose 20.34 points to 2,741.29.
All 17 euro zone countries and six others that aspire to join the currency bloc resolved to negotiate a new 
agreement alongside the EU treaty, with a tougher deficit and debt regime. But the fact that Britain was left out of 
the deal and the lack of progress on immediate measures to ease pressure on government bond markets prompted 
a number of investors to doubt Friday's rally would last. "From what we have seen so far, this summit has not 
produced a silver bullet," said Gary Jenkins Head of Fixed Income at Evolution Securities.
Shares in bookies, Paddy Power, fell 105c to E40.62. The Australian Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on 
Gambling Reform yesterday (December 8th) published its second report on interactive and online gambling and 
advertising. This report will form part of the review being carried out by the Department of Broadband, 
Communications and the Digital Economy into interactive gambling. It is expected to draft legislation by mid-2012. 
"While yesterday's report is undoubtedly unhelpful from the operators' perspective, it is worth reiterating that our 
current Paddy Power estimates assume no change in in-play restrictions in Australia. As such, there would be no 
material earnings impact to our forecasts should the restrictions remain in place. We continue to believe that 
regulatory change in Australia is just one of a number of potentially positive options attached to the stock with 
several markets globally currently regulating their online markets," said Davy analyst, David Jennings. Shares in

E25/£25 (from E35 to E60) per bag. Ryanair's shares rose 9c to E3.84. Housebuilder, Abbey reported first half 
2012 revenue of E33m, 6pc behind Goodbody's forecasts, which translated into an operating profit of E2.3m versus

Ryanair is to put up the price of checked in luggage in peak periods to discourage its passengers from taking too 
much baggage.
In June, July, Aug, Sept and Christmas 2012, it will increase checked-in baggage fees from 20 to 25 euros per bag 
for all online bookings made from 15 December.
Ryanair will also increase its checked in bag fees paid at call centres and airports from 35 to 60 euros per bag.
In the low season, (October to May) online checked-in bag fees will remain unchanged at 15 euros per bag. If that 
wasn't enough, Ryanair will also increase its ' boarding card reissue penalty' from 40 to 60 euros, from 15 January 
2012. It says the move is to 'try to persuade the less than 10 passengers per day who refuse/fail to bring their 
boarding card (despite email reminders) to their departure airport as 99.9pc of Ryanair passengers already do' . 
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: 'Over 70pc of Ryanair passengers will be unaffected by these changes as they 
already travel with no checked-in bags and instead use Ryanair's free of charge 10kg carry on allowance.'

it will drop its EGM request.
It said it is doing so because the Board of Aer Lingus has breached Irish Company Law and the EU Shareholder

Ryanair said it will drop its EGM request but that it will continue, through direct correspondence and - if necessary - 
legal proceedings, to raise the two issues of Aer Lingus' alleged "cover up" of the Deloitte and McCann Fitzgerald 
report into the E30m "leave and rehire" Revenue Commissioners'penalty.
It added that it will also continue to press Aer Lingus on its alleged impending entry into "negotiations" at the LRC to 
address a claimed E500m deficit in the airline's pension scheme. "Ryanair has asked Aer Lingus to explain why it is 
"negotiating" at the LRC, when its 2006 IPO prospectus provided legally binding assurances to shareholders, that 
its pension schemes are defined contribution only, in which case neither Aer Lingus nor its shareholders have any

Highlight: Protest over Iberia's low-cost ambition
Body
Spain's pilots' union has announced that it will strike over the Christmas period in an escalation of an industrial 
dispute triggered by Iberia's plans to establish a new low-cost domestic carrier.
Sepla, which represents pilots working for Iberia, now the Spanish unit of a merged holding company with British 
Airways, voted to strike for two days in December. BA cabin crew walked out last year over moves to cut staff on 
long-haul flights.
Iberia earlier this year announced plans to create Iberia Express , a low-cost carrier designed to trim its costs and 
boost profitability at a time when its short- haul operations are struggling in the face of competition from low-cost 
airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair.
Spain's large network of cross country high-speed trains, combined with well established low-cost airline routes, 
has further weighed on profitability for other airlines.
Sepla, which voted for crews to strike on December 18 and December 29, said it regarded the plan as illegal since 
it was announced because it broke collective agreements made between pilots and Iberia during the merger with 
British Airways to form International Airlines Group.
Rafael Sánchez-Lozano, Iberia's chief executive, has pledged that no staff will lose their jobs after the creation of 
Iberia Express, and that the new entity would not immediately take control over all of the carriers' short and 
medium-haul flights.
The company said that it had not broken its agreements, as the wages for Iberia pilots who will transfer to Iberia 
Express will not change. As a result, it argues, the strike is illegal.

However, IAG said that it plans to recruit any new staff for the new operation at "market rates", which could be 
lower than the current collectively agreed contracts, a move it hopes will help cut operating costs at the lossmaking 
short and medium-haul business.
Iberia Express will take four planes from Iberia's stock when it comes into operation next year, with the company 
later lifting the number to 40 by the end of 2015.
Iberia has 68 aircraft in operation for its medium and short-haul flights.
Both Iberia and BA have reported operating losses so far this year as they struggle to trim costs and provide stiffer 
competition for their low-cost rivals.

Body
AIRLINES lined up to condemn the government's stance on air travel yesterday, calling the government's 
consultation on air passenger duty "a sham and a waste of taxpayers' money".
The Treasury confirmed yesterday that the levy on passengers would jump by eight per cent in April, despite a 
massive lobbying effort by the airlines, who argue that the charge is hitting tourism.
The hike comes at a time when airlines are already frustrated by the coalition's lack of ideas for keeping up with 
international growth in air travel, with a third runway at Heathrow scuppered and a plan for a new hub in the 
Thames Estuary still in its infancy.
British Airways said the most recent blow had made its plans to create 800 new jobs next year impossible, and that 
it would cut this number in half, and shelve up to three Boeing 747s.
The government launched a consultation in June about its plans for an APD rise at double the rate of inflation, but 
said the 500 responses it received had not changed its mind.
It made clear that the tax is a revenue raising exercise rather than an environmental levy. Yet it has cut the fee for 
flights from Northern Ireland - even though the Treasury expects the resulting increase in demand to be "negligible".
BA, EasyJet, Virgin Atlantic and Ryanair said in a joint statement the consultation "has been a sham and a waste of 
taxpayers' money. We are left with a tax that has already cost 25,000 jobs, is doing increasing damage to the 
prospects for economic recovery."
Airlines say air tax talks were a sham; TRANSPORT
The UK is set to lose a total of £1.1bn from tourism spending by 2017 thanks to the rising cost of APD discouraging 
holidaymakers from visiting, according to research by the Tourism Alliance.
But the tax has done little to put off Air China from the UK - the firm yesterday unveiled a new Gatwick to Beijing 
service, starting in May.
