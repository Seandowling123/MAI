Ryanair has announced further cuts in routes and flights from Dublin Airport this summer, RTE reports.
In February, the airline said it was cutting the number of planes based in Dublin from 22 to 18. Today, it said it 
would remove another plane from Dublin and close four routes - to Basel, Doncaster, Oporto and Teesside. There 
will be reduced frequencies on eight more routes.
This will result in 50 more jobs being lost in Dublin according to Ryanair. This follows the airline saying last month 
that 200 jobs would go at Dublin, though the staff affected were being offered moves to other bases outside Ireland.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary blamed the latest cuts on the new EUR10 travel tax and an increase in charges by 
the Irish Aviation Authority.

Bumpy landing ahead for Aer Lingus shares
Bumpy landing ahead for Aer Lingus shares
Sunday Business Post

Section: THE MARKET
Length: 958 words
Body
Take a bank account containing  650 million in cash and add it to an airline.
The result? A combined entity that the stock market valued at just  250 million last week. Aer Lingus may have tired 
of telling the world that it's really worth a lot more than the markets think, but last week's share price collapse - to a 
new record low - suggested that its audience has tired just as much.
The airline that was undervalued, according to chief executive Dermot Mannion, when Ryanair put in offers of  2.80 
per share in 2006 and  1.40 last December, traded last week at 48c. Although chief financial officer Sean Coyle 
described last week's prices as ''great value'', it will come as little comfort to shareholders that have grown 
accustomed to the concept of delayed gratification.
Perversely, some may feel their pockets would be better off if the airline was wound up and the proceeds of a 
liquidation returned to shareholders in cash. The combination of its  650 million net cash, its aircraft fleet and 
valuable slots at London's Heathrow Airport could generate a payoff of up to  1.5 billion, according to some industry 
estimates - the equivalent of a round  2.80 per share.
Such an outcome is firmly off the agenda, however. Mannion remained in business-as-usual mode last week as the 
airline reported pre-tax losses of  120 million for the year to December, a sharp reversal following the  125 million 
profit recorded in 2007.
The share price collapse was ''not a factor unique to Aer Lingus'', he said, warning that 2008 had been 
''exceptionally challenging'' and that operating losses would be bigger this year. Despite this, he urged shareholders 
to stick with the airline and forgive its losses in the hope of medium-term gains. But the outlook suggested that, with 
hindsight, the option oft a king the  2.80 on offer from Ryanair and heading for the exit may have been the wiser 
choice.
The pressures of2 008 went far beyond splashing out almost  6million in takeover defence costs. Aer Lingus 
booked exceptional charges of  118 million in restructuring, which Mannion said would be repaid in a little over two 
Bumpy landing ahead for Aer Lingus shares
years in the form of ongoing cost savings, and a residual  18 million paid out during the year to finish off a 2007 
cost-reduction programme.
Trading conditions worsened sharply, on the back of higher fuel costs and weakening passenger demand. 
Passenger revenues were 2.5 per cent higher, but the airline needed a 7.5 per cent increase in passenger numbers 
to achieve this.
The impact of higher oil prices was cushioned by an astute hedging strategy last year, but hedging 2009 fuel costs 
at relatively high prices will mean that Mannion will not get the benefits of falling oil prices as quickly as he would 
have liked.
Deteriorating trading conditions since Christmas will force further aggressive price-cutting, which, coupled with 
capital investment plans, restructuring costs and changes in working capital, will result in the airline's cash cushion 
being severely depleted by the end of 2009.
Net cash balances were predicted to shrink from 650million to between  400 million and  430 million.
The combined impact of lower cash balances and lower deposit interest rates will halve finance income - one of the 
biggest contributors to pre-tax profits since flotation - from  39 million to  20 million this year. Mannion's strategy for 
coping with the recession appears centred on stripping out costs and reducing the airline's dependence on routes 
out of Dublin.
He recently announced plans to set up Aer Lingus' first overseas base, in London Gatwick, and was upbeat last 
week on the ability of the Aer Lingus brand to operate successfully on routes that neither began nor ended in 
Ireland.
The new Gatwick base will serve routes to both Ireland and continental Europe, while Mannion has also teamed up 
with US carrier United to operate an Aer Lingus service betweenWashington and Madrid from 2010. It will take time, 
however, for his gamble on non-Irish routes to be put to the test. He will hope to have more success than with 
previous grand gestures on the strategic front, such as a long-haul route to Dubai that failed to gain traction and 
was withdrawn last year.
In the meantime, he will once again test shareholders' patience, confident in the knowledge that neither the 
government nor the employee share trust, which between them account for more than 35 per cent of his 
shareholder base, are sensitive to prolonged share price weakness. Last week, Mannion praised the government's 
commitment to a strategy of having two major airlines based in Ireland - a strategy that will copperfasten Aer 
Lingus's standalone status, no matter what happens to the share price.
While Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary may continue to grumble about Aer Lingus's day-to-day operations - 
even threatening last week to take yet another formal complaint to the stock exchange and Irish Takeover Panel 
over claims made during the takeover over Aer Lingus's profitability - he has little room to manoeuvre on his 
investment in the airline and can do little to extract himself from it without incurring sizeable losses.
For unaligned shareholders, however, the attractions of continuing to persist with Aer Lingus are steadily 
weakening. Caught between O'Leary's plans to wipe out his rival and Mannion's ambitions to go it alone, their main 
fear may be that Aer Lingus will stumble along in a twilight zone, battling to return to profitability against the 
backdrop of an indifferent stock market.
With little liquidity in the stock, no dividends to look forward to and a logjam on the shareholder register that 
removes any prospect of a takeover premium, the investment case is far from compelling.
Neither Mannion nor O'Leary would have wanted this.

High Court dismisses attempt to block expansion at Stansted

Highlight: Service standards regime tightened
Body
BAA is free to raise capacity at London Stansted airport by 40 per cent to 35m passengers a year after an appeal 
against the expansion was defeated in the High Court.
The airports operator faces tough financial penalties if its service to passengers and airlines is poor, however, under 
a five-year price control regime for Stansted announced separately yesterday by the Civil Aviation Authority. The 
new rules are to be introduced next month.
Last October, ministers approved growth from the previous limit of 25m in spite of opposition from environmental 
groups, councils and residents.
The Stop Stansted Expansion campaign mounted a challenge, saying the government had breached the law by 
failing to take full account of the environmental and economic impact of allowing more flights.
Sir Thayne Forbes, sitting as a judge of the High Court, said the protesters' criticisms of the way in which the 
planning inquiry inspector and the transport department had handled the issues were "without substance".
Nick Barton, commercial and development director at Stansted, said the social and economic case for expansion of 
capacity from the single runway "remains strong".
Stansted can increase the maximum number of passengers using the airport on the single runway from 25m to 
35m, while the number of flights to and from the airport can be increased from 241,000 to 264,000.
Passenger traffic at Stansted, the most important airport for low-cost airlines in Europe, has been falling for more 
than a year. The number in the first two months was 13.8 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago, and 
traffic has been falling year-on-year for 16 months in succession. In the 12 months to the end of February, Stansted 
handled 21.9m passengers.
Plans by BAA for a second runway and terminal face delays because of uncertainty over future ownership of the 
airport.
High Court dismisses attempt to block expansion at Stansted
The Competition Commission is to report next week on its two-year investigation into the structure of BAA. It is 
expected to demand the break-up of the world's biggest airports operator - a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial since 
2006. The commission is also likely to call for the sale of Gatwick, Stansted and Glasgow or Edinburgh.
The CAA, the airports economic regulator, said Stansted would be obliged to repay charges totalling up to £10m a 
year to airlines if it failed to meet the terms of a new service regime.
Ryanair, the low-cost carrier, said the CAA's proposal was "too little too late after it has presided over years of 
abysmal service at Stansted and its history of rubber stamping cost increases for airports".

Broadband behind 55% advance at Inmarsat

Body
Like its satellites, Inmarsat appeared to defy gravity yesterday as it announced a 55 per cent rise in annual pre-tax 
profits.
In spite of the downturn, the British satellite operator has benefited from growing use of broadband internet 
communications on ships and aircraft and in remote areas of the globe, boosting pre-tax profits from $124.7m to 
$193.8m (£140m).
Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive, said the company's satellite technology tended to be seen as essential 
equipment by its customers.
"We are used in places where there is no existing infrastructure. There is no alternative," he said.
Some analysts had feared that Inmarsat's largest business sector - providing shipboard satellite phones and 
internet connections - could be hit by the reduction in global shipping. However, maritime revenue rose 7.2 per cent 
in 2008.
"Communications is only about half a per cent of the cost of operating a container ship, while fuel is about 20 to 30 
per cent. Running a monitoring programme, via satellite, that allows you to get greater fuel efficiency from the 
engine will save more money than cutting back on communications," Mr Sukawaty said. "There is a trend to use 
more rather than less of this equipment."
The biggest growth came in the aeronautical sector, where revenue rose 45 per cent to $64.4m. Inmarsat allows 
phone calls and internet access on corporate and government jets. Commercial passenger airlines such as 
Emirates and Ryanair have also begun allowing passengers to make mobile calls in mid-flight, using Inmarsat's 
satellites.
Mr Sukawaty also said the company, which owns 11 satellites, was planning to launch a mobile satellite phone in 
the first half of 2010, with a target of 10 per cent market share in two years.
Broadband behind 55% advance at Inmarsat
Revenue for the year to December 31 was up 72 per cent from $576.5m to $996.7m, although this in part reflected 
the acquisition of Stratos Global Corporation, one of its distributors, which Inmarsat is to complete next month.
The final dividend rises 5 per cent to 18.2 cents, bringing the total to 30.33 cents (29.46 cents).
Shares in Inmarsat, which have fallen more than 22 per cent since last September, rose 29p to 459pp.
  FT Comment 
With about 40 per cent of its business coming from government and defence, part of Inmarsat's revenue is always 
going to be fairly secure. Yesterday's news that shipping revenue is holding up well is added relief. Two things 
make Inmarsat potentially exciting. First, the prospect of a takeover by Harbinger, the US hedge fund, if it can get 
approval from US government. That could come this summer. Even if there is no deal, Inmarsat's satellites are 
becoming more important as governments want to ensure ubiquitous broadband access. Satellite coverage will 
become an important way to achieve those hopes. The stock looks fairly resilient with some long-term upside 
potential, and is therefore not a bad bet.

Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, today slammed the UK Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA's) proposal to impose fines on 
poor performing airports.
The airline said that the proposal is "irrelevant after its history of abject failure to properly regulate the BAA 
monopoly and called once again for the immediate sale of London Stansted Airport in order to improve airport 
performance and competition".
Ryanair questioned why it had taken the CAA so long to address the inadequate performance of airports and why it 
has taken a Competition Commission investigation before the CAA has addressed costs at London's airports.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Stephen McNamara, said: "The CAA has rightly followed the recommendations of the 
Competition Commission in relation to pricing after a review of BAA's abusive practices at Stansted airport. BAA 
consistently ignores the requirements of users in order to build grossly expensive facilities and provides very poor 
service levels to passengers as demonstrated by horrendous security queues."

Body
The main Irish shares index rebounded in afternoon trading, lifted by a three-day rally on Wall Street.
The ISEQ climbed 43.88 points to 1,991.29.
U.S. stocks gained on relief that ratings agencies cut General Electric's ratings by just a single notch and signalled 
no further downgrades loomed.
"It's a combination of better-than-expected retail sales and the GE news," said one Dublin stock exchange trader. 
"A lot of things are priced for the apocalypse, but they're not quite that bad." Back home, UTV Media was the 
biggest gainer of the day so far with shares up 9c to E0.67 after it reported pre-tax profits, before exceptional items, 
of £20.3m sterling for 2008, down 2pc from 2007's figure of £20.8m. UTV's group turnover increased by 6pc to 
£120.3m, driven by what it called a £7.5m uplift from its acquisitions in Irish radio. It also noted a significant 
appreciation in the sterling value of its euro revenue. However, this was partially offset by a £3.3m reduction in 
television revenue. Banks put on modest gains with investors impressed by Wall Street's burst of confidence with 
AIB up 2c to E0.46, Bank of Ireland edged up 1c to E0.22 and Irish Life and Permanent rose by 2c to E0.78. Press 
reports doing the rounds indicate that Ireland may adopt a similar approach to France in raising Government 
guaranteed debt for covered banks after the end of September 2010, as it looks to extend the current guarantee. 
The proposal is that the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) would raise the guaranteed debt and 
allocate it amongst the covered institutions, as opposed to the current approach of each of the banks being 
allocated a time slot during which to tap the markets for debt, so that the State or more than one bank are not 
coming to the market at the same time, Godbody Stockbrokers noted. The changes in earnings guidance between 
last December and this week from management at Aer Lingus has shattered credibility in its ability to do its job, a 
note from Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin said. "The material change in guidance for 2009 (from the position only 
two months back) and the significant working capital and capex related deterioration in expected cash balances 
have seriously undermined board and management credibility and this is reflected in a lack of confidence in the 
ISEQ rises on Wall Street 3-day rally ISEQ Up
stock," the note said. It added that management actions need to be more focused on unlocking value for 
shareholders. Shares in Aer Lingus inched up 1c to E0.59 after losing 20pc on Wednesday while Ryanair was down 
8c to E2.84. McInerney has announced that its revised UK lending facility was signed by all parties on March 10th. 
The group had flagged in its January trading update that agreement had been reached in principle and that final 
sign-off was likely before the full-year results. A revised covenant structure for its Irish banking facilities was agreed 
in August of last year. Shares in the firm were flat at E0.10.

Body
Ryanair has condemned the EU's proposal to waive the 'use it or lose it' rule in relation to airport slots as airlines 
continue to reduce capacity at slot controlled airports.
The Commission's proposal would mean that it would no longer be mandatory for these airlines to operate and use 
their slots in order to retain them and could prevent Ryanair from using them.
Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley said: "This is protectionism of the worst type and will lead to further state 
and EU support for inefficient, high cost airlines which don't have the cost base to support growth or even the 
maintenance of existing services. The Commission's proposal will ensure that these inefficient, high cost airlines 
can hold on to valuable slots at slot coordinated airports without using them and essentially block any plans by 
Ryanair to grow at these airports. This is bad for aviation, airports and, above all, consumers as it reverses Europe 
back to its old regulated ways in aviation when inefficient, monopolistic, state run airlines blocked more efficient 
operators from competing on a level playing field."
"Ryanair is set to grow by 9 million passengers this year, much of which will be at slot coordinated airports. Our 
path to reduce fares and increase passenger traffic should not be blocked by the inefficient, high fares airlines aided 
and abetted by the EU Commission's misguided decision to allow them to hold on to slots without operating them." 
"We call on the EU Parliament and the EU governments to reject this protectionist proposal from the Commission 
and allow free access to unused slot times at all airports throughout Europe so that the most efficient operator can 
prevail and customers can enjoy the guaranteed lowest fares".

Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley said: "This is protectionism of the worst type and will lead to further state 
and EU support for inefficient, high cost airlines which don't have the cost base to support growth or even the 
maintenance of existing services. The Commission's proposal will ensure that these inefficient, high cost airlines 
can hold on to valuable slots at slot coordinated airports without using them and essentially block any plans by 
Ryanair to grow at these airports. This is bad for aviation, airports and, above all, consumers as it reverses Europe 
back to its old regulated ways in aviation when inefficient, monopolistic, state run airlines blocked more efficient 
operators from competing on a level playing field."
"Ryanair is set to grow by 9 million passengers this year, much of which will be at slot coordinated airports. Our 
path to reduce fares and increase passenger traffic should not be blocked by the inefficient, high fares airlines aided 
and abetted by the EU Commission's misguided decision to allow them to hold on to slots without operating them." 
"We call on the EU Parliament and the EU governments to reject this protectionist proposal from the Commission 
and allow free access to unused slot times at all airports throughout Europe so that the most efficient operator can 
prevail and customers can enjoy the guaranteed lowest fares".

Further pre-tax loss likely this year
Body
Aer Lingus shares lost about a quarter of their value after the Irish carrier warned it was "unlikely" to report a pre-tax 
profit in 2009.
Announcing results for the year to December 31, the Irish airline yesterday revealed a pre-tax loss of EUR119.7m 
(£111m) compared with a profit of EUR124.8m in 2007.
Dermot Mannion, chief executive, said: "Falling consumer demand in key markets, a weakening dollar and sterling, 
and increased competition across the network combined to put sustained and significant pressure on our business 
throughout the year".
Stripping out an exceptional charge of EUR140.9m - including EUR117.5m related to early retirement and 
severance costs of its labour restructuring - the airline made a profit of EUR21.2m, down 84 per cent from 
EUR131.1m in 2007.
Turnover increased 5.6 per cent to EUR1.36bn, with passenger numbers up but average fares declining. Passenger 
revenue rose 2.5 per cent, while turnover from ancillary services such as inflight sales, baggage handling charges 
and online booking fees rose almost 38 per cent.
However, the airline was hit by a EUR148m increase in its fuel bill as a result of rising oil prices earlier in the year.
In December, in its defence of Ryanair's takeover bid, Aer Lingus said it "expects to report a profit in 2009". But it 
now said it "will experience a larger operating loss than in 2008 and . . . the group is unlikely to meet its previous 
guidance of a pre-tax profit in 2009".
The bid collapsed when the Irish government, which retains 25 per cent of Aer Lingus, rejected Ryanair's EUR1.40 
a share offer.
Trading caution hits Aer Lingus
Shares in Aer Lingus closed down 19.2 cents at 58 cents.
  FT Comment 
One of Aer Lingus' main attractions for Ryanair was its large cash balances, a legacy of privatisation and Willie 
Walsh's restructuring. Yesterday's fall in the shares was prompted less by the profits warning than the company's 
guidance on cash burn, with net cash falling from EUR650m at the end of 2008 to EUR400m-EUR430m by the end 
of the current year. The company expects losses at the operating level to worsen this year. Airlines are notoriously 
susceptible to global recessions. Colm Barrington, chairman, said he expected a number to fail. As the operating 
environment worsens, only if Aer Lingus can reduce unit costs further can it avoid more cash outflows.

Highlight: Further capacity cuts at European airlines
Cathay reports its biggest annual loss
Body
Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, the two leading European airlines, announced further capacity reductions for the 
summer season yesterday in the face of the deepening world recession.
Airlines around the globe are being hit by the mounting crisis in aviation. More are seeking to defer delivery of new 
aircraft, undermining the outlook for production at jetmakers Airbus and Boeing, and smaller producers such as 
Brazil's Embraer and Canada's Bombardier.
Cathay Pacific, the de facto Hong Kong flag carrier, reported its biggest annual loss in its 63-year history as it felt 
the impact of a sharp fall in demand for air travel and wrong-way bets on the hedging of its fuel purchases.
In Ireland Aer Lingus, which has fought off a second hostile takeover bid from Ryanair, announced it had fallen into 
loss last year and warned it was "unlikely" to report a pre-tax profit this year as passenger fares and cargo volumes 
fall sharply. Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, which owns 29 per cent of Aer Lingus, accused the Aer 
Lingus board of "misleading" shareholders, and said he planned to submit formal complaints to the London and 
Irish stock exchanges, the take-over panel and the financial services regulator.
Cathay said 2009 would remain "extremely challenging" as the financial crisis curbed passenger and cargo traffic. It 
warned that high hedging losses would continue to hurt its bottom line, if fuel prices remained at their present level. 
"The aviation industry is in crisis," said Christopher Pratt, Cathay's chairman. "We cannot say how and when things 
may get better. Our assumption at this stage is that demand and yield will continue to slide in the coming months."
To counter the recession, Cathay has already cut capacity, grounded flights, delayed construction of a cargo 
terminal and offered unpaid leave to staff.
German carrier Lufthansa said it was cutting its dividend sharply and reducing planned capacity growth, as it 
reported a two-thirds fall in net profit in 2008 due in part to the impact of some troubled investments.
Aviation industry is 'in crisis'
But, with demand for air travel falling as the global recession bites, Wolfgang Mayrhuber, Lufthansa chief executive, 
said 2009 sales and operating profit would fall well below 2008 levels.

Body
Irish airline Aer Lingus Group PLC reported Wednesday it suffered a full-year net loss, citing the unprecedented 
expense of fuel, and forecast further red ink in 2009 because of Ireland's deepening recession.
Aer Lingus said it suffered a 2008 net loss of €107.8 million ($136.3 million), compared with net profit of €105.3 
million in 2007, which was the airline's first full year of operation as a publicly listed company.
Sales rose 5.6 percent to €1.36 billion. The airline said its fuel costs rose 58.4 percent in 2008 to €401.3 million. It 
also reported an exceptional loss of €117.5 million paid out to union-represented employees who were either laid off 
or agreed to sign new labor contracts designed to boost their productivity.
While the airline said its labor costs were likely to fall sharply in 2009 as a result of those reforms, its ticket sales are 
performing more poorly than expected amid rising unemployment and deepening consumer anxiety.
"Passengers are increasingly booking later and lower fares are necessary to ensure load factors remain stable. In 
order to maintain volumes, it is now expected that in 2009 average fares will decline by a minimum of 10 percent 
compared to 2008," the airline said.
"In the current climate we believe that in 2009 Aer Lingus will experience a larger operating loss than in 2008, and 
that in these circumstances the group is unlikely to meet its previous guidance of a pre-tax profit in 2009," it told 
investors.
The airline previously had said it expected to record a 2009 profit because of its leaner labor structure.
Aer Lingus shares have fallen sharply in recent weeks after its Dublin-based rival, Ryanair, abandoned its latest 
hostile takeover attempt.
They reached a high last year of €2.42 amid speculation that Ryanair already Aer Lingus' No. 1 shareholder with a 
30 percent stake could persuade the No. 2 shareholder, the Irish government, to hand over its 25-percent holding. 
Ryanair gave up when Ireland's debt-hit government said it must keep its holding to ensure competition between 
the two airlines.

Body
Irish airline Aer Lingus Group PLC said Wednesday that record costs for fuel pushed it to a net loss in 2008 and 
surprised analysts by forecasting further losses this year because of slumping consumer spending.
The company's already battered shares suffered a 27 percent plunge, closing at to €0.58 ($0.74) on the Irish Stock 
Exchange, hitting a record low dating back to the government's September 2006 flotation of the previously state-
owned airline.
Analysts said they were particularly alarmed that Aer Lingus has abandoned its previous expectations of recording 
a profit this year.
The airline's Dublin-based rival, Ryanair, accused Aer Lingus of lying to shareholders during Ryanair's recent 
hostile takeover attempt. Aer Lingus chiefs had insisted they were on course for profit without Ryanair, which is 
already Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he would pursue formal complaints to the London and Irish Stock 
Exchanges and Irish regulators about Aer Lingus' Dec. 22 defense document that forecast 2009 profits. O'Leary 
said Aer Lingus chiefs had distributed "patently false claims and misleading advice."
Aer Lingus offered no immediate response to Ryanair's accusations.
Aer Lingus said it suffered a 2008 net loss of €107.8 million ($136.3 million), compared with net profit of €105.3 
million in 2007, the airline's first full year of operation as a publicly listed company.
Sales rose 5.6 percent to €1.36 billion, but fuel costs jumped 58.4 percent to €401.3 million. The airline also 
reported an exceptional loss of €117.5 million paid out to union-represented employees who were either laid off or 
agreed to sign new labor contracts designed to boost their productivity.
While the airline said its labor costs were likely to fall sharply in 2009 as a result of those reforms, its ticket sales are 
performing more poorly than expected amid rising unemployment and deepening consumer anxiety.

"Passengers are increasingly booking later and lower fares are necessary to ensure load factors remain stable. In

compared to 2008," the airline said.

that in these circumstances the group is unlikely to meet its previous guidance of a pre-tax profit in 2009," it told 
investors.
The airline previously had said it expected to return to profit this year because of its leaner labor structure.
Aer Lingus shares have fallen sharply in recent weeks after Ryanair, which initially tried to take over Aer Lingus in 
late 2006 and has built up a 30 percent stake, abandoned its latest hostile takeover attempt.
Aer Lingus shares reached a high last year of €2.42 amid speculation that Ryanair could persuade the No. 2 
shareholder, the Irish government, to hand over its 25 percent holding. Ryanair gave up when Ireland's debt-hit

The Dublin shares market bucked the trend in markets across the world as shares in Aer Lingus plummeted 
following a profit warning.
The index fell by 38.22 points to 1,947.41.
Shares in the former national carrier plunged by 26pc or 21c to E0.58 after it reported an E119 million pre-tax loss 
for 2008 and said it was unlikely to meet its forecast of a profit for this year.
Aer Lingus posted a E17.6 million operating loss, which it said is expected to increase in 2009 as passenger fares 
and cargo revenue fall. The company reported an after-tax loss of E107.8 million, Aer Lingus said that 
"unprecedented high fuel prices" last year resulted in a 54pc increase in fuel costs. Overall, fuel represented 29.2pc

The Dublin shares market bucked the trend in markets across Europe as shares in Aer Lingus plummeted following 
its profit warning.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 28.55 points to 1,957.08.
Shares in the former national carrier plunged by 21pc or 17c to E0.62 this morning after it reported an E119 million 
pre-tax loss for 2008 today and said it was unlikely to meet its forecast of a profit for this year.
Aer Lingus posted a E17.6 million operating loss, which it said is expected to increase in 2009 as passenger fares 
and cargo revenue fall. The company reported an after-tax loss of E107.8 million, Aer Lingus said that 
"unprecedented high fuel prices" last year resulted in a 54pc increase in fuel costs. Overall, fuel represented 29.2pc 
of total operating costs while staff costs contributed a further 24.3pc of total operating costs. Airport charges 
represent 17.7pc of operating costs Aer Lingus delivered a 2008 pre-tax profit of E21.2 million after taking into 
account a net finance income of E38.8 million and before deducting an exceptional cost of E117.5 million for 
restructuring. Shares in Ryanair fell by 9c to E2.93. European shares rose early on Wednesday, led by banks and 
miners and a rise in U.S. index futures, amid faint hopes that the US banking sector could see some stabilisation 
this year following Citigroup's results on Tuesday. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European companies was up 
1.5 percent at 701.31 points after being down as much as 681 points. On Tuesday the index rose 5.1 percent, the 
biggest one-day percentage gain in three months. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was up 0.7 percent, 
Germany's DAX was 1.9 percent higher and France's CAC 40 was up 1.7 percent. Shares in Irish oil explorer, 
Tullow Oil, which is traded on the London Stock Exchange, fell by 5.72pc as investors took profits from a major 
sustained rally in the stocks ahead of its full-year report today. The firm posted 2008 net profits of £226m, up 330pc 
and said the outcome represented a record result and had been driven by a strong operational performance. It said 
it had also been helped by higher oil and gas pricing, as well as profitable portfolio management, offset by

exploration writeoffs and impairments. There was further evidence yesterday of the mounting pressures on some of 
CRH's peer group with Fitch downgrading the ratings on both Cemex and Heidelbergcement to B (from BB and BB-
) and keeping the rating watch on negative. Furthermore, Ennstone (the UK based building materials group) was 
placed into administration. Shares in the irish building materials group gained 6c to E13.54. In its full year 2008 
results presentation, Paddy Power highlighted that one of its best weeks in 2008 (in gross win terms) was the 
Cheltenham Festival, which started this week. However, the first day of racing was bad news for the Irish bookie 
with Irish horses beating favourites in three big races. Shares in Paddy Power fell by 54c to E12.10.

No frills airline Ryanair has said it will close all its airport check-in desks from October 1 next and have passengers 
check in online instead.
"All we will have is a bag drop where passengers can drop off their luggage, otherwise everything will be done 
online," the airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary says.
He added that savings will be passed on to passengers in the form of lower fares.
Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara says that 75 percent of the airline's passenger already use its online 
check-in services. "We are trying to encourage the remaining 25 percent to do the same," he said. As a first stage 
towards the introduction of its new regime, web check-in will be extended from March 19 to non EU/EEA citizens 
and reduced mobility customers. From that date, passengers will be also be able to check luggage in on-line for a 5 
euro fee. New bookings made from May 1 will have to use on-line check-in. And in order to dissuade travellers who 
booked before this from using check-in desks, the charge for doing so will be doubled from that date to 20 euro. 
This charge will then be phased out over the summer. From 1 October onwards, passengers who have checked in 
bags will use the airport 'bag-drop' desks. The change will lead to layoffs but the airline used many third-party staff 
at airports and would attempt to limit the effect of the reduction. "We are hoping the job cuts will be minor," 
McNamara said.

Body
Aer Lingus has dived to a pre tax loss of 119.7m euro for its year to December last.
The outcome is a tumble from a pre tax profit of 124.7m in its previous year, due to massive exceptional costs 
during the year due to restructuring.
More disappointing is that it made an operating loss of 17.6m euro before exceptionals for the year, reversing a 
profit on the same basis of 88.5m euro in 2007.
The airline has this morning blamed the operating loss on "unprecedented high fuel prices during the year resulted 
in a 148m euro (58.4pc) increase in fuel costs". Revenue at the carrier was up by 3.5pc to 1.35 billion euro. 
Passenger numbers rose by 7.5pc to just over 10 million, with average the average fare dropping by 4.6pc to 
115.15 euro. Aircraft utilisation increased by 3pc on short haul and 2.1pc on long haul. The airline has also warned 
of uncertain times ahead. In a statement with its results this morning, it said it "expects to grow passenger volumes 
marginally in 2009". However, it warns that "forecasting a full year outcome in a weak and rapidly deteriorating 
operating environment is difficult" It adds: "The weakening economic environment has, in particular, impacted the 
cargo and Premier sections of our business." Although it made an operating loss of 17.6m euro for the year, net 
interest payments of 38.8m euro arising from its huge cash pile took it to a pre tax profit of 21.2m euro for the year 
before exceptionals. The exceptionals came to 140.9m euro, made up of 5.9m euro in defence costs against 
Ryanair buyout efforts, and 135m euro in restructuring costs and compensation to staff under the airline's ongoing 
programme for change. Cost savings on staff would come to an annualised 52.0m euro at least, starting in April 
2009. Annual non-staff cost savings of 24.0m euro would also be delivered for 200 in the areas of airport costs, 
professional fees and distribution costs. The airline also said it had currently hedged 22pc of its fuel requirements 
for this year at an average price of USD 876 per tonne. Implementation of new third party maintenance contracts 
delivering annualised savings in excess of 20.0m euro.

(RTTNews) - Wednesday, Irish low-cost, low-fares airline Aer Lingus Group PLC (AERL.L) reported a loss for the 
full-year 2008, compared to profit in last year. The results reflected hike in fuel costs, and net exceptional losses. 
Further, the group said that it is unlikely to meet its earlier guidance of a pre-tax profit in 2009 as it expects larger 
operating loss in 2009 than in 2008.
Aer Lingus&apos; 2008 loss before taxation was EUR 119.7 million, compared with a profit of EUR 124.73 million in 
the prior year.
Loss attributable to equity holders of the parent was EUR 107.81 million or 20.4 cents per share, compared to a 
profit of EUR 105.26 million or 19.8 cents per share in the previous year.
Unprecedented high fuel prices during the year resulted in a EUR 148.0 million, a 58.4% increase in fuel costs from 
EUR 401.3 million in the previous year and a consequent operating loss of EUR 17.6 million.
Operating expenses rose to EUR 1.375 billion from EUR 1.2 billion, a year earlier.
However, revenue increased 5.6% to EUR 1.35 billion from EUR 1.28 billion in the last year, reflecting passenger 
growth and strong growth in ancillary revenue.
Net exceptional losses of EUR 140.9 million were recorded in 2008. This consisted of EUR 117.5 million in relation 
to staff cost restructuring, EUR 5.9 million relating to the defence of a takeover bid by Ryanair Holdings Plc and 
EUR 17.5 million compensation payments under the Programme for Continuous Improvement.
In addition, the group reported full-year 2008 traffic, measured in Revenue Passenger Kilometres, or RPKs of 16.27 
billion, up 79.9% from 14.8 billion in the last year. Capacity, measured in Available Seat Kilometres, or ASKs 
increased 13.9% to 22.37 billion from 19.63 billion in the prior year. Whilst, passenger load factor dropped 2.6 
points to 72.8% from 75.4%, a yea ago.
Moving ahead, in the current climate, Aer Lingus believes that in 2009 it would experience a larger operating loss 
than in 2008 and that in these circumstances the group is unlikely to meet its previous guidance of a pre-tax profit in 
2009.
Aer Lingus posts loss in FY08 - Update
Additionally, in order to maintain volumes, Aer Lingus expects average fares to decline by a minimum of 10% in 
2009 as compared to 2008. In line with international trends, cargo revenue is expected to fall by up to 30% year-on-
year.
The group stated that the capacity in 2009 would reduce, compared to 2008 levels due to the ongoing fleet 
refurbishment program over the Winter 08/09 period, and the suspension of the Los Angeles route. In addition, the 
reduction of the long haul fleet from 9 aircraft to 8 aircraft means that long haul capacity, measured in ASKs, for 
2009 would be 13.6% below 2008.
AERL.L is currently trading on London stock exchange at 0.6550 pence, down 15.76%.

Cross-border mergers and acquisitions are as elusive to investment bankers as to the airlines they once flew. 
British Airways, taxiing towards a merger with Spain's Iberia, says f ewer passengers flew at the sharp end of its 
planes in February. Premium traffic slumped by a fifth as business and first class flyers evaporated. The downturn 
also grounded business passengers at Air France-KLM, Europe's largest airline, where passenger traffic fell 6 per 
cent overall. Less class-conscious SAS and Finnair respectively reported a 20 per cent slump and a 2.5 per cent 
surge.
In less turbulent times high-margin passengers accounted for the bulk of airlines' earnings. Now some are switching 
to low-cost carriers. Even so, traffic fell nearly 7 percent at EasyJet, though larger Ryanair bucked the trend with a 
rise.
Still, storm clouds loom for the whole industry. Business travel and air cargo revenue could fall by up to a fifth this 
year, while passenger revenue could slide at least 5 per cent, leading to a 6-7 per cent decline in underlying 
revenue, according to Citi. BA, for one, is steeling itself for two years of operating losses. All airlines can cut costs 
though. Ryanair makes a habit of it, while also charging for just about everything except the air passengers breathe. 
Some airlines are stuck with costly fuel hedges, taken out last year. Capacity cuts can work: last month's 9 per cent 
reduction by British Airways helped boost its load factor marginally, though a 4.5 per cent cut did not help Air 
France-KLM. Contrarian Ryanair meanwhile increased capacity and routes.
So there is no quick fix. In this turbulence, low-cost operators may be more manoeuvrable and benefit from flag 
carriers' capacity cuts. Yet, if the turbulence is prolonged, British Airways, with a healthy balance sheet and 
hopefully Iberia at its side, begins to look the business.

Ryanair has accused Aer Lingus of misleading shareholders and said it will submit a formal complaint to the Irish 
and London stock exchanges, the Takeover Panel and the Financial Regulator.
Ryanair claims that Aer Lingus misled shareholders in its Defence Document in December in which the airline said 
it would make a profit in 2008.
The move comes after Aer Lingus this morning reported an E119 million pre-tax loss for 2008 today and said it was 
unlikely to meet its forecast of a profit for this year.
Speaking today Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "Today's results from Aer Lingus prove conclusively that the 
Chairman Colm Barrington, Board and Management of Aer Lingus misled shareholders and the Stock Exchange in 
their Defence Document of just 10 weeks ago. Shareholders are entitled to ask why there is no mention in today's 
results about restoring or improving shareholder value. It would appear that the Board and Management of Aer 
Lingus care more about lining their own pockets with excessive and unjustified Director fees and multi million euro 
resignation bonuses for failed management than they do about growing Aer Lingus, delivering profitability or 
shareholder value."

Body
No frills airline, Ryanair, today said that it will move to 100pc web check-in from October 1, this year.
It said the move will allow all passengers, including those travelling with checked baggage, to check-in online 
thereby avoiding time wasting queues and delays at airport check-in desks.
Having printed their boarding cards at home passengers without check-in bags can continue to proceed directly 
through airport security while those with check-in bags can simply present at one of Ryanair's "drop desks" before 
proceeding through airport security to the boarding gate.
"This will free passengers from wasting hours at airports prior to departure and will dramatically reduce travel times 
for all Ryanair passengers." From 19th March 2009, Ryanair's web check-in service will be extended to (a) non 
EU/EEA citizens, (b) passengers travelling with checked baggage and (c) reduced mobility customers. Customers 
choosing web check-in and travelling with only carry-on bags will continue to enjoy this service free of charge. A 
web check-in fee of E5 per person/per flight will apply to passengers travelling with checked baggage, while 
customers who wish to use airport check-in will be charged an airport check-in fee of E10 per person/per flight at 
the time of booking. From 1st May 2009 all new bookings will be required to use web check-in, and the use of 
traditional airport check-in desks will be phased out over the summer months. The web check-in fee of E5 per 
person, per flight will apply to all new bookings (except promotional fares) from 1st May 2009. In order to dissuade 
passengers from using airport check-in desks, the fee for airport check-in will double to E20 per person/per flight at 
the time of booking. From 1st October 2009 airport check-in desks will no longer be available at any Ryanair airport. 
All passengers will be required to web check-in and those who have checked in bags will use the airport "bag drop" 
desks, if required. From this date, children under the age of 16 will no longer be able to travel unaccompanied and 
passports and national ID cards will be the only accepted forms of photo ID on Ryanair flights. Ryanair's Stephen 
McNamara said: "Ryanair's web check-in service is currently used by up to 75pc of our passengers. This increasing 
trend has allowed Ryanair to continue to reduce our guaranteed lowest fares. Ryanair's average one way air fare 
Ryanair to be all Web check-in by Oct Ryanair check

Reigning Irish champion trainer Willie Mullins has a real chance of picking up the leading festival trainer award this 
week. However, he'll have to defeat Britain's champion trainer Paul Nicholls, who has won it for the past three 
years.
The 26 races over four days are worth stg£3.65 million ( 4.1 million), but the title is decided by the number of 
winners and placed horses, not by prize money. Mullins may send 22 horses over, and could open the meeting with 
a winner, as his horse, Cousin Vinny, which will be ridden by his son Patrick, is 2/1 favourite for the Supreme 
Novices Hurdle - the first race on Tuesday. Quevega is joint favourite for the mares hurdle on the same day.
The Co Carlow trainer will start Wednesday in the RSA Chase with Cooldine, which Ruby Walsh has elected to ride 
instead of Paul Nicholls' What a Friend, part-owned by Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. Walsh is 
Nicholls' stable jockey in England, but also gets to ride the pick of Mullins' string. Mullins - who passed the 100 
winners mark in Ireland last weekend - will be going for his seventh win in the Wetherby's Champion bumper, where 
he mayhave six runners.
Curragh trainer Dermot Weld's Rite of Passage, owned byDr Ronan Lambe, is chasing a stg£35,000 bonus from 
Paddy Power bookmakers in the same race after winning at Naas recently. Irish racing tycoon JP McManus targets 
this meeting everyy ear, and appears to have a particularlystrong team for this week.
He has the short-priced favourite Binocular in Tuesday's stg£211,000 Champion Hurdle, trained in England by 
Nicky Henderson and ridden by McManus's retained jockey, Tony McCoy. Jered, trained by Noel Meade, could also 
line up. McManus hasn't won the race since the Aidan O'Brien-trained Istabraq's three-in-a-row success from 1998 
to 2000. McManus also has the Enda Bolger-trained pair of L'ami and Garde Champetre in the Cross 
CountryChase on the opening day, where Ryanair boss Michael O'Learyis represented byDix Villez.
Winners all right? Who's who at Cheltenham
O'Leary's Gigginstown House colours won't be represented in the race he sponsors, the Ryanair Chase on 
Thursday, but his 2006 Gold Cup winner, War of Attrition, should line up against Kauto Star and Denman in Friday's 
stg£270,000 feature.
Siege master, trained by Dessie Hughes, and Hangover, trained by Conor O'Dwyer (who rode War of Attrition to 
Gold Cup glory), are some of his other entries this week. Edward O'Grady is the leading Irish trainer at the meeting, 
with 18 winners.
Oliver Brady's Ebadiyan, a 10/1 shot for the stg£68,000 Triumph Hurdle on Friday, will be the most eagerly 
anticipated Irish runner of the week for the Co Monaghan businessman.

A music and social networking company backed by the family investment vehicle of the late Ryanair founder, Tony 
Ryan, has become the latest victim of the economic downturn.
Dublin-based Blastbeat organised music and business competitions for second-level students in a number of 
countries, and had negotiated a major sponsorship deal with Coca-Cola.
However, the directors of Blastbeat now intend to place the company into liquidation following ''a major collapse in 
the global sponsorship and advertising market''.
In 2007,Blastbeat raised  1.1 million in a funding round led by Irelandia. Enterprise Ireland also backed the 
company, whose chairman is Ryan's son, Declan.
''I think we were a victim of the global economic crisis," said Robert Stephenson, who established the company in 
2003. ''This was not the climate we had hoped for in terms of raising sponsorship.
''Everyone is pulling back from sponsorship now, and we were caught in the crossfire. Sponsorship revenues simply 
collapsed."
The directors have invited creditors to a meeting in Dublin in the coming days, during which they will propose the 
appointment of a liquidator.
The company had piloted its scheme in South Africa and the US, while it also agreed a deal to license the business 
in Britain.
''What we were trying to do was unique, but it is a tough climate out there," Stephenson said.

Meet Brian Peters. A man who carries a scruffy backpack, rather than a briefcase; prefers a dated mobile to an 
iPhone; and drives a nine-year-old Volvo estate when he could easily afford something much flashier.
Business card? Nope. Email? No, sir. Blackberry? Not a chance. Peters, who left school after his Inter Cert, is just 
not that type of guy.
''Would you believe I can't even turn on a computer?" the Meathman says, with what seems to be a mix of pride and 
embarrassment. ''I am an absolute disaster. I can't type, have never sent an e-mail in my life, and wouldn't know 
one end of the internet from the other. The last letter I wrote was to Santa."
Shunning e-mail has its drawbacks - Peters reckons his mobile phone bill this year will top  25,000 - but it has not 
affected his ability to strike deals across an extensive portfolio of business interests.
Peters likes to introduce himself as ''a farmer, first and foremost'', and there is little about his appearance to suggest 
otherwise. At this interview, he wore Michael O'Leary-style blue jeans and a checked navy shirt. Like the Ryanair 
chief executive, however, there is more to Peters than meets the eye.
If he is not behind the counter of one of his six pubs, he is signing contracts to bring championship boxing matches 
to Ireland through his company, Brian Peters Promotions. There have been incursions into property as well, 
developing projects around the midlands in league with hi s brother Colum.
''A few apartments, houses, a bit of retail, that kind of stuff. Every second fellow in the country was a developer, and 
I suppose we were no different," he said. Then there are his other interests - a fast-expanding collection of art, and 
a fast running collection of greyhounds.
Peters is coy about revealing the extent of either, but admits to having stakes in the latest winner of the Puppy 
Derby and the British Derby champion.
The knockout king
In his spare time, he likes to ''get away from the bullshit of life with its status and egos'' by heading for Connemara 
with a blank canvas, and painting landscapes. But there has been little time for artistic retreats in the west recently.
Having jobbed around Ireland and Europe for 16 years, Brian Peters Promotions is going big time. In two weeks' 
time, Peters is staging the Hunky Dory World Title Fight Night in the O2 venue in Dublin, an evening Peters 
described as the ''biggest professional and financial gamble'' of his life.
Top billing goes to Bernard Dunne's attempt to take the WBA Super Bantamweight title from defending champion 
Ricardo Cordoba, but the under card contains plenty of other Irish boxing heavy hitters. Olympic bronze medallist 
Paddy Barnes is scheduled to fight, as is Katie Taylor, the two-time world amateur champion.
Olympic silver medallist Kenny Egan was on the card, but withdrew last week after his US sojourn. All told, the 
three-hour televised event will consist of five professional bouts, five amateur fights and all the ''razzmatazz'' Peters 
can conjure up. Pianist and composer Frank McNamara has been hired as musical director for the night, and a 
number of artists will be there to sketch images of the bouts.
''Times are tough, money is scarce, so you have to be innovative and put on a show," said Peters. ''We have a lot of 
tricks up our sleeve. Mark my words, it will be the best night in Irish boxing history."
Peters is praying for two things - a full house of 9,000 people and a Dunne victory. Anything less than 85 per cent 
capacity at the O2 and the promoter is out of pocket, while a defeat for the Dublin-born fighter would be a massive 
blow both to Dunne and to his promoter-cum-manager.
''If Bernard wins, Main Street Las Vegas here we come," said Peters. ''But if he is beaten a few times, the show is 
over. It is a snakes-and-ladders game and we will go right back down to the bottom. That's boxing for you."
Dunne is Peters' star turn, a swaggering and cocksure Dubliner who learned his trade in US gyms before returning 
to Ireland. The business plan was to build up a supporter base, win some fights, and then have a shot at a lucrative 
world title. That plan came undone last year, when Kiko Martinez, a squat, unheralded Spaniard, came out swinging 
and Dunne forgot to duck. Knockout.
Dunne saw stars and the Brian Peters business plan collapsed along with his fighter. ''It was over in 93 fecking 
seconds. Hero one minute, knocked down the second.
Fickle business," he said. But Dunne and Peters both battled on. Dunne won some comeback bouts, and Peters 
put  200,000 on the table to convince Cordoba to defend his title in Dublin. Game on, again.
''The costs associated with this world title show are huge. As far as Ireland is concerned, there is no one else that 
could do this show like me or make this happen, absolutely no one," Peters said.
There is no arguing with that point - boxing in Ireland is almost entirely reliant on terrestrial television, and Peters 
has a monopoly lock-in deal with RTE. Under the terms of his contract, the state broadcaster must use Brian Peters 
Promotions for all professional boxing it shows. However, the state broadcaster has no exclusivity on Peters - he is 
free to negotiate with any channel and has struck one-off deals with Sky, ITV and BBC in the past six months.
''The budget is tightening at RTE, so I had to go elsewhere.
One fighter, Paul McCloskey, now fights on Sky," he said. The RTE deal effectively means that any fighter who 
wants his or her bouts to be shown on RTE must work with Peters, leading him to agree terms with other prominent 
Irish fighters, such as Andy Lee and John Duddy.
They can fight for whoever they want abroad, but Ireland is the domain of Brian Peters Promotions. The deal has 
irked his rivals at home and abroad, but Peters is defiant.
''Some people call it a dictatorship or whatever, but we are trying to protect Irish boxing. You don't want all the wild 
boys coming over from London or the States. I am a bona fide businessman, I will be staging fights in 20 years' time 
The knockout king
and I have a reputation to preserve," he said. ''When I do a show, everyone is paid when they walk out of the arena. 
We try and do things properly."
With Dunne pulling in more than 600,000 viewers a fight, RTE is not complaining either.
''Love or hate him, Bernard is pure box office," Peters said. Peters is also using Dunne's world title attempt to raise 
the profile of some of the other fighters on his books - including Oisin Fagan and Andy Murray, a young Cavan 
fighter who will be boxing for the EU lightweight title. The aim is to build the brand of his next generation of fighters 
and make them household names.
''Boxing promoting is all about building stars, building stories. Nothing sells a ticket like a good back story," 
according to Peters. His own ''back story'' is pretty compelling also. A self-confessed ''wild child'' with no interest in 
school, he parted company with formal education when he was 14, preferring instead to ''do my own thing, make 
my own way in the world''. His love of boxing stems from a disastrous trip to Las Vegas in 1986 to see Irish world 
champion Barry McGuigan fight Steve Cruz. McGuigan lost his title, and Peters lost his life savings on a bet with a 
rich Texan in crocodile boots and a white suit. ''I was like an anti-Christ.
I lost everything, but I worked my way home and kept on working when I got back," he said.
He befriended some amateur fighters, and landed his big break in 1993 when he was asked to help promote a 
Wayne McCullagh fight in Dublin.
One fight led to another, and soon Peters was the ''man on the ground'' for a number of high-profile bouts, including 
the world title fight between Chris Eubank and Steve Collins in Cork in 1995.
''Again, I was the local fella, the little lad doing the ground work. Barry Hearn and Barney Eastwood really put it 
together, but my name went on the top of the poster. I suppose I was serving my apprenticeship, and you could not 
learn from much better than Hearn and Barney," he said.
Peters started putting on his own shows, striking deals with the likes of Sugar Ray Leonard and US boxing mogul 
Matt Tinley. Then Dunne came along, RTE liked it what it saw, and sponsors like Hunky Dorys and Martin Donnelly 
were injecting cash. Brian Peters Promotions had arrived.
Peters likes where he's at and has no intention of moving abroad, or diversifying into other sports. He knows 
boxing, knows Ireland, and says he is ''not out to conquer the world''.
''It is about having the strength to make things happen, self strength, inner strength," he said. ''When I get the bit 
between the teeth, I will just keep on going. Mymotto is GID- Get It Done," he said.
''I don't do projections, I don't do cost/benefit analysis. I work on intuition, a sixth sense that it will work, that the 
numbers will stack up."
Sometimes, he goes ahead if his sixth sense tells him the numbers don't stack up. He lost ''a six-figure sum'' when 
an Andy Lee show bombed in December 2007. Peters saw it coming, but said there was method to his madness.
''He came out the following February and sold out in nine minutes. Why? Because people saw him on the television 
in December and they knew who he was," he said. ''Any time I do something, there are a lot of reasons why."
Given that he has more pieces in play than a chessboard, it is difficult to argue with that.

A surge in bank shares failed to lift the ISEQ index out of the red today as the collapse in banking stocks means the 
sector now has little impact on the overall market.
The index fell by 18.49 points to 2,000.90 by 12:30 this afternoon.
Shares in AIB jumped by 30pc or 8c to E0.35 and Bank of Ireland climbed 44pc or 6c to E0.18 as bargain hunters 
descended on stocks that are being seen as having hit close to rock bottom. However, whereas just 18 months ago, 
the two top banks made up close to 45pc of the market cap of the entire Irish index, the carnage of the credit crisis 
and subsequent rescue has reduced the stocks to marginal status, at best.
Traders said that, although buying volumes were strong, it would be unwise to read too much in to today's rally as 
institutional investors still shun the stocks with most of the buying being done by retail purchases. The Bank of 
England officially announced its quantitative easing plan on Thursday. The best way to see it is that the Bank is 
printing money and giving it to holders of government bonds (mainly banks). It is one step away from shelling new 
notes out directly to consumers and businesses but is definitely a positive move, Davy's Rossa White said. "Yet the 
question of whether it will work boils down to these two issues: is the usual money transmission mechanism broken 
because banks don't have enough capital and will household and business borrowing appetite pick up given high 
debt levels?" Shares in Irish Life and Permanent fell by 3c to E0.77. Elsewhere, shares in Cemex, a near-peer to 
Ireland's CRH, fell by 16pc in the US last night as concerns increased that the company may find it difficult to 
refinance its debt maturing in 2009 and that, if it does succeed, the cost could be excessive. Cemex may be forced 
to sell more assets in order to improve its balance sheet position. Shares in CRH fell by 26c to E14.74. There may 
be still some way to go if price rises are to cover higher fruit costs and the impact of the year-on-year fall in the 
dollar/euro exchange rate, but the European green banana price is showing some much needed life, Davy says. 
Shares in Irish fruit importers, Fyffes, fell by 2c to E0.18. Ryanair yesterday announced it was doing its bit for

tourism in Ireland by absorbing the upcoming E10 travel tax that will be levied on passengers who fly to destinations 
outside Ireland. In recent weeks, the airline has indicated that a combination of economic weakness and the 
passenger tax was leading it to cut capacity in Ireland in the coming year and was anticipating a 2m passenger 
number decline in its Irish traffic for 2010. Given that Ireland accounted for about 15pc of its originated traffic 
according to its Q3 conference call, this would imply a material decline to the estimated 9m Irish passengers it 
carried in 2009, Goodbody Stockbrokers said. Shares in the airline fell by 3c to E2.90 while Aer Lingus rose by 3c 
to E0.79.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary insisted Thursday he's serious about making passengers pay for the right 
to relieve themselves on flights and is flush with interest in the idea of mounting credit card-operated toilets.
O'Leary, whose Dublin-based airline has pioneered the practice of filling air travel with extra charges, divided 
opinion last week by suggesting that his next target would be coin-operated toilets. Aviation analysts and the 
traveling public alike couldn't tell whether O'Leary a cut-throat operator with an entertainingly bombastic style was 
poking fun at his own reputation.
The Ryanair boss told a dumfounded Dublin press conference Thursday the days of the unlocked potty are indeed 
numbered.
"Eventually it's going to happen. It's just we can't do it at the moment because we don't have a mechanism for 
charging you," he said.
O'Leary said he has asked engineers at U.S. aircraft maker Boeing which supplies Ryanair's entire fleet of 737-
800s to design toilets with doors that open only if you swipe a valid credit card through the locking mechanism. He 
conceded that his earlier idea, to make them coin-operated, wouldn't work in part because Ryanair operates heavily 
in areas using both the euro and British pound.
"We have looked into this before, and the problem is Boeing can't come up with a mechanism on the toilet door to 
take coins," he said. "We're suggesting they go back and look at a mechanism where you'd swipe the credit card for 
a quid (British pound) on the toilet door. They've gone off to look at that. ... We are serious."
He didn't seek to soften the impression that Ryanair was happy to make its passengers suffer.
"Most people would go to the loo (toilet) before they get on the plane, or they hold it until they land. You would only 
have to deal with the people who absolutely have to go," he said.
One positive effect, he said, would be to "reduce an awful lot of the unnecessary visits to the toilet that (expletive) 
so many passengers off."
Ryanair chief says he's serious about pay toilets
It could also become the next serious money-maker at Ryanair, already Europe's most profitable and aggressively 
expanding airline. O'Leary estimates if 20 percent of passengers pay 1 pound (€1.12, $1.40) to use the restroom, 
this would generate 15 million pounds (€17 million, $21 million) annually which he characterizes as future "fare 
savings to the traveling public."
Ryanair is famous for offering officially "free" flights that end up costing €50 ($70) or more once fees for check-in, 
luggage and on-line payment are applied. On board, the airline hawks bingo cards and duty free goods on short-
hop flights that can last barely an hour. It offers no snacks or drinks for free, not even tap water.

Germany 's Fraport says 2008 profit down 17 pct
Germany's Fraport says 2008 profit down 17 pct

Body
German airport operator Fraport AG said Thursday its 2008 net profit fell 17 percent as revenue declined largely 
due to a divestment. It expects sales and profits to decrease further this year.
Frankfurt-based Fraport, which runs Frankfurt Airport, continental Europe's second-busiest after Paris Charles de 
Gaulle, said net profit in 2008 fell to €173 million ($217.2 million) from €209 million in 2007. Group revenues for the 
year fell 9 percent to €2.1 billion from €2.3 billion.
Fraport said revenues were lower because of the sale of its subsidiary, International Consultants on Targeted 
Security, or ICTS, in April 2008.
Fraport did not provide fourth quarter net profit figures but said its operating profit during the October through 
December period reached €25 million, up from €9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, largely a result of lower 
staff costs. Sales in the fourth quarter were 13 percent lower at €502 million from €574 million.
The company said it expects a decline in passenger volumes, revenue and profit in 2009, partially as a result of the 
ICTS sale and the divestment of its stake in Frankfurt-Hahn regional airport. Last month, Fraport transferred its 65 
percent ownership in Hahn to the German state of Rheinland-Palatinate, without disclosing details.
Fraport had proposed a new passenger fee at the airport, but Hahn's biggest customer Ryanair PLC protested the 
move, threatening to pull its operations from the airport entirely. The German government intervened, saying it 
could not allow that to happen in the economically depressed region.
Fraport's other business was mixed during the year.
The company said its aviation business revenues were largely flat at €698 million due to capacity constraints and 
higher staff costs. Revenues from airport fees fell 1 percent for the year to €539 million from €545 million a year 
prior.
It said traffic was affected by strikes during the third quarter, in which airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG Fraport's 
biggest customer at Frankfurt Airport grounded many flights.
Germany 's Fraport says 2008 profit down 17 pct
Ground handling revenues for Fraport increased 4 percent in 2008 to €643 million, helped by the implementation of 
a new automatized baggage system.
Fraport has many interests in airports around the world. The company said Lima, Peru and Antalya, Turkey 
contributed strongly to the company's full-year results.
Lima's revenues were up 5 percent to €93 million while Antalya revenues rose 22 percent to €80 million.
Shares of Fraport rose more than 4 percent at €24.50 in Frankfurt morning trading.

Ryanair today presented its rescue plan for Irish tourism to the Government appointed Tourism Renewal Group in a 
briefing at Dublin Castle.
It called for the scrapping of the E10 travel tax and the public service subsidies, close down the aviation regulator's 
office, scrap the Dublin Airport Metro which will cost over E5 billion and allow competing airports (Shannon and 
Cork) and terminals (Dublin) to incentivise low cost traffic growth.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "Irish Government policy is devastating the tourism industry. It is time the 
Government stopped protecting the DAA monopoly and forced it to reduce charges in the same way that many 
other UK and European airports are reducing charges to grow traffic. It is sad that Ryanair will reduce traffic to/from 
Ireland this year by almost 2 million passengers, during a year when Ryanair's total traffic will grow by some 9 
million passengers across Europe. The DAA's high costs are killing Irish tourism."
"Secondly the Irish Aviation Regulator is useless and should be dismissed. Cathal Guiomard makes Patrick Neary 
look like Eliot Ness. He has rubberstamped repeated cost increases at Dublin Airport, the costs of his own office 
have doubled over the last 5 years and he has recently signed off on further price increases at Dublin to pay for the 
overblown Terminal 2 which the Government's Appeal Panel has confirmed was "greatly oversized". Air passengers 
should not be expected to pay for the waste and incompetence of the DAA monopoly or this utterly useless 
Regulator. In the UK, airport regulation has been found to have failed consumers and the BAA monopoly is being 
broken up. The failed DAA monopoly should also be broken up if we are to reverse the current collapse in Irish 
tourism." "Finally, the E10 travel tax is without doubt the most stupid initiative of many stupid initiatives taken by this 
Government in recent months. You cannot stimulate tourism by taxing tourists. These travel taxes have already 
caused UK and Dutch air traffic to collapse. They will have a similar effect on Irish traffic, particularly to the regions. 
When these monies (and more) can be raised by sensible spending cuts such as scrapping the PSO subsidies, the 
Ryanair presents its tourism rescue plan Ryanair Plan
wasted tourism marketing funds, getting rid of the unnecessary and unwanted Dublin Airport Metro, there is no 
justification for this tourist tax and we call again, even at this late stage, to scrap it. Perhaps Tourism Minister, 
Martin Cullen, instead of wasting money flying around Ireland in his chopper could do something useful by 
scrapping this tourist tax, in which case, Ryanair will reverse its recent route and traffic cuts. Ireland's tourism 
industry is being devastated by these stupid Government policies which can and must be reversed if we are to turn 
the current traffic declines into tourism growth".

that is was never really on the cards, according to Davy's Rossa White. The problem in Ireland is that real rates are

even higher. "It is time for the ECB to be daring given the problems of smaller euro area nations and the lack of

Irish Life and Permanent's results this week were modestly behind analysts' estimates (E14m at operating profit

E35m, which it hopes to be able to set off against its own exposure, so the provision may yet prove conservative.

From Mr Daniel Amini.
Sir, Is it not rather short-sighted of Michael O'Leary to introduce a toilet charge on flights? ("Spending a penny at 
Ryanair could cost a pound", February 28.) Surely this will adversely affect the highly profitable sales of beverages 
on their planes as passengers try to minimise the chances of spending the proverbial penny?
Ryanair shareholders, beware!

Provider OnAir targets 100 aircraft fleet by year-end as low cost carrier

In-flight mobile communications specialist OnAir believes up to 100 aircraft could be flying with its phone service by 
year-end, as Ryanair starts building coverage to support its own multi-aircraft launch.
Ryanair has gone live with the mobile service on board 20 aircraft, predominantly operating from Dublin in what the 
airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary describes as "a trial" that he "suspects will be successful". The carrier will 
ramp up to 50 aircraft during the six-month trial and expects to outfit its 170-strong fleet over the next two years.
The OnAir system enables six simultaneous voice calls to be made in flight - this capability will be increased to 12 
by year-end - alongside text and emails, transmitted over Inmarsat's SwiftBroadband network. Call rates are set by 
individual mobile operators and are in line with international roaming rates, rather than intra-European Union call 
rates, at typically ?2-3/min ($2.5-3.8/min) for voice calls.
"There are very substantial [set-up] costs, so it is reflected in the initial charges being somewhat high," says 
O'Leary. "As it grows, the cost and charges will inevitably fall." He adds that Ryanair is looking at the service "as an 
attractive feature and a growing source of revenue".
One of the tasks is to alert people, who have long been told mobile phone use is prohibited, that they can use their 
phones on these flights. "It will take time, not like the [instant move to] non-smoking," says OnAir chief executive 
Benoit Debains.
Ryanair marks the first OnAir installation on a Boeing aircraft. Air France was the first airline to carry out a trial of 
the text and messaging service, on an Airbus, in December 2007, which it has since extended to include voice-call 
capability. BMI and TAP Portugal are also carrying out single-aircraft trials, while Kuwaiti start-up Wataniya Airways 
launched with OnAir earlier this year.

AirAsia and British Airways should launch the service in the third quarter, while Brazil's TAM, Oman Air and 
Pakistan's Airblue will all fly before the end of the year. "By the end of the year, I think there will be between 90 and 
100 aircraft flying," says Debains.
Emirates, which launched with rival provider AeroMobile almost a year ago, recently logged its 100,000th in-flight 
mobile call using the service.

Stansted planning inquiry is postponed
Stansted planning inquiry is postponed

Body
The start of the planning inquiry into the building of a second runway and second terminal at London Stansted by 
BAA has been postponed by ministers because of the uncertainty over the future ownership of the airport.
The Competition Commission is expected in a landmark report this month to demand the break-up of BAA, the 
world's biggest airports operator and, since 2006, a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial.
It is likely to call for the sale of Gatwick and Stansted and one of either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports in order to 
improve competition in the UK airports market and to end BAA's monopoly of the leading London and Scottish 
airports.
It is not yet clear whether BAA, which owns seven UK airports, including Heathrow, will fight the demand that it sell 
Stansted, the third largest UK airport and the most important base for low-cost airlines in Europe, but the new 
owners are expected to want to alter the nature of the BAA development scheme.
Hazel Blears, the communities and local government secretary, bowed yesterday to the growing pressure from 
opponents of the second runway and from Ryanair and EasyJet, the biggest airlines operating at the airport, and 
agreed that the planning inquiry be delayed.
"I am certain that we should neither be seen to second-guess the contents of the final report [by the Commission] 
nor the response of the airport operator [BAA] until after they have had time to consider its findings and 
implications," she said.
A planning inquiry, expected to last 18 months and starting only a couple of weeks after the publication of the 
watchdog's report, would not allow BAA sufficient time "to consider its findings fully, including any possible 
implications for the inquiry", said Ms Blears.
BAA applied a year ago for planning permission for the £2.5bn project to double capacity to 68m passengers a 
year, the current size of Heathrow airport.
Stansted planning inquiry is postponed
The expansion has been firmly supported by the government ever since publication of its air transport white paper 
in December 2003, in spite of fierce opposition from environmental campaigners, residents' groups and the local 
authorities.
The white paper originally envisaged that the second Stansted runway, the first full length runway to be built in the 
south-east of England for more than 60 years, would be in operation by 2011-12, well ahead of a third runway at 
Heathrow, but the timetable has been gradually slipping, as opposition to the scheme has grown and the urgency of 
the need for extra capacity has diminished.
Meanwhile, passenger traffic at Stansted has been falling for more than a year. The number of passengers in 
January fell by 11.2 per cent year on year, a 19 per cent decline in two years, and BAA said last month that the 
"increased uncertainty created by current economic conditions" meant that it had put back the expected opening 
date of a second runway from 2015 to 2017.

Changes to European civil aviation law and the flourishing of low cost carriers have been highly detrimental to 
airline employees, a researcher will tell delegates at the European Transport Workers Federation (ETF) conference 
in Brussels tomorrow.
The conference on "Economic Crisis and Consolidation in the Civil Aviation Industry" will examine the impact of the 
two major crises to have struck the industry - that resulting from the terrorist attacks of September 11 and today's 
downturn caused by the US-born global financial crisis.
In particular, the impact of legislative changes born in the wake of the 2001 crisis and the emergence of low cost 
carriers on airline management will be examined.

Changes to European civil aviation law and the flourishing of low cost carriers have been highly detrimental to 
airline employees, a researcher will tell delegates at the European Transport Workers Federation (ETF) conference 
in Brussels tomorrow.
The conference on "Economic Crisis and Consolidation in the Civil Aviation Industry" will examine the impact of the 
two major crises to have struck the industry - that resulting from the terrorist attacks of September 11 and today's 
downturn caused by the US-born global financial crisis.
In particular, the impact of legislative changes born in the wake of the 2001 crisis and the emergence of low cost 
carriers on airline management will be examined.

The Inquisitor: Ireland Inc 's corporate governance isn't good enough

The decision by former Anglo Irish Bank non-executive director Gary McGann to step down as chairman of the 
Dublin Airport Authority (DAA)came as no great surprise. That is, of course, unless you work for the DAA.
In the wake of the Anglo debacle, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary called for McGann to step down from the DAA post, to 
which the state body replied that it wouldn't dignify the suggestion with a response. In the brave new corporate 
world, it seems that many people have completely different views about what is appropriate and inappropriate when 
it comes to staying on as directors of companies.
McGann said his decision was partially due to the demands of running Smurfit Kappa where the share price has 
fallen by 85 per cent in a year, and the controversy over Anglo Irish Bank.
The boards of several companies have let themselves down in the last year when it comes to corporate 
governance. Take, for example, the decision by the board of DCC to back Jim Flavin after the highest court in the 
land had concluded that Flavin engaged in insider trading.
Or take the incredible statements issued by the former board of Anglo Irish Bank on December 18 last, regarding 
the incredible news that its chairman Sean FitzPatrick had hidden tens of millions of euro in loans from them, the 
auditors and the market for nearly a decade.
The Anglo statement issued on behalf of the board, which included Smurfit Kappa chief executive Gary McGann, 
said it accepted FitzPatrick's resignation "with regret".
It went on to affirm his visionary driving force and the "sad" day that it was for him. It also declared that "all directors' 
loans are agreed on normal commercial terms and conditions".
It went on to add that it was "important to state that the Annual Reports of the Bank for each of the years in question 
represent a true and fair view of the Bank. The disclosures in each of the annual reports were in full compliance 
with Companies Acts requirements".
The Inquisitor: Ireland Inc 's corporate governance isn't good enough
The board also allowed FitzPatrick to issue his official statement, still available on the Anglo Irish website to say that 
"the transfer of the loans between banks did not in any way breach banking or legal regulations". There are so 
many holes in the above statements that, to coin a phrase, they shouldn't be dignified with a response.
The board of Anglo has insisted that it didn't know what FitzPatrick was up to. But the above statements reflect a 
deep failure in the culture of the organisation and a strange approach to confronting wrongdoing.
There is no question concerning the honesty and integrity of Gary McGann as a leading figure in Irish business. He 
didn't know about what was going on inside Anglo Irish Bank. Unfortunately, as a director of it, he should have 
made it his business to find out.
McGann had given a glimpse of his priorities in approaching the challenges currently facing corporate Ireland just 
seven days earlier, when he addressed the Business & Finance annual awards dinner in UCD, where he received a 
lifetime achievement award.
That night (December 11), the room was alive with speculation that Sean FitzPatrick was about to go from Anglo 
Irish Bank, but the rumour machine shed little light on exactly why he was going to go. McGann, who shared two 
boards with FitzPatrick, got up to give his acceptance speech. And, in typical McGann fashion, it had been 
meticulously prepared, well researched, and delivered in a very genuine and personable way.
But on the issue of the crisis facing corporate Ireland, he said: "We also know from experience that the blame game 
is a self-indulgence that we cannot afford. We need to use our energy to work on solutions, and not to dwell on the 
problems or what might have been."
"Let the academics advise us on the lessons that need to be learnt, but let the practitioners do what they are good 
at and deliver! Let us concentrate on solutions and not be consumed with the punishment agenda and, where 
sanctions are needed, let's not dive for the red card when a yellow card is more appropriate."
He advocated the "we are where we are" approach to tackling Ireland's woes. There is no reason to suspect that he 
was talking about Sean FitzPatrick in particular, who sat just a few tables away that night, but it sheds some light on 
McGann's wider view about dealing with the mess we are in.
Insofar as the Anglo Irish board statement of December 18 reflected a certain bonhomie and perhaps naivety 
towards FitzPatrick, then it should be kept in mind that all of the directors on whose behalf the statement was 
issued have since resigned; all except the chairman, who replaced FitzPatrick with immediate effect that day, Donal 
O'Connor, who continues as chairman today.
If criticism of McGann for lending his name to that statement is valid, then it is equally valid to the chairman of the 
board that issued it. O'Connor has gone to great lengths to emphasise the distance between the old Anglo and the 
new.
He referred to it with the publication of the bank's annual report and accounts on Friday, February 20.These were 
issued after 4pm on a Friday afternoon, with no press conference to make O'Connor or others available to take 
questions.
The sections of the accounts which deal with directors' loans, controversial loans of  451 million to the so-called 
Golden Circle and the Irish Life & Permanent deposits raise more questions than they answer. In these bizarre 
times in which we find ourselves, there are so many different views about how to respond to corporate scandal. We 
must have justice, but shouldn't have a witch-hunt.
We must have answers about the past, but not dwell on it for too long. We need new blood in the banks, but must 
have some continuity to keep credibility. If McGann is right that business leaders should emerge from the ashes 
and deliver, they certainly haven't covered themselves in glory so far.

Many pensioners who live overseas could be forced to return to the UK due to the steep rise in the cost of living 
abroad, according to financial advisers.
For the 1m British pensioners estimated to be living in a foreign country, the pound's weakness against currencies 
in popular destinations such as the US and Spain has cut the buying power of retirement income by up to a third.
Sterling's slide has coincided with falling pension and property values, which have further eaten away at the capital 
of those who have retired abroad.
Pensioners who live overseas are being advised to take advantage of cost savings where they can.
Those who use high street banks to pay pensions and mortgages overseas are often charged to move their money 
abroad. On average, overseas pensioners who use high street banks pay £780 each year in charges and 
commissions, according to Currencies Direct. Using a currency specialist, such as Currencies Direct or HiFX, can 
save 4 per cent in transfer fees and allow customers to fix the currency rate.
But even saving on money transfers might not be enough.
Low-cost air travel to provincial locations in France, Spain and Italyled to a spate of property developments nearby. 
But now some routes are being withdrawn as airlines cut costs, while other budget airlines, such as XL and Zoom, 
have gone bust.
Ryanair has postponed flights to seven new destinations in Europe, BA has cut flights from Gatwick to Geneva, and 
BMI has cut its Gatwick to Jersey service.

Ryanair, the leading European low-cost airline, is considering charging passengers to use the toilets on board its 
aircraft.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the Irish carrier, told the BBC in a television interview: "One thing we have 
looked at in the past and are looking at again is the possibility of maybe putting a coin slot on the toilet door so that 
people might actually have to spend a pound to spend a penny in future."
The airline has gone further than most rivals to charge passengers for different services from onboard food and 
drink to checking in bags, as it seeks to reduce fares and offset the fall by driving up its ancillary revenues.
A spokesman for Ryanair said yesterday that an early move to charge for toilets was unlikely, however.
"Michael makes a lot of this stuff up as he goes along and while this has been discussed internally there are no 
immediate plans to introduce it," he said. "However, this highlights Ryanair's continuing obsession with lowering 
costs and passing these savings on in the form of lower fares.
"Ancillary revenues, all of which are avoidable, help to reduce the cost of flying Ryanair and passengers using train 
and bus stations are already accustomed to paying to use the toilet so why not on airplanes?
"Not everyone uses the toilet on board one of our flights but those that do could help to reduce air fares for all 
passengers."
The UK Civil Aviation Authority, the safety regulator, said there were no legal blocks to charging for onboard toilets.
A few years ago EasyJet also reduced the conventional number of toilets from three to two on its new Boeing jets in 
order to cram in an extra passenger seat.
Ryanair said this week it was planning to abolish conventional check-in facilities at airports across its European 
network by early next year, forcing all passengers to check in online and print their boarding cards before leaving 
Spending a penny at Ryanair could cost a pound
home or the office. It is part of a concerted drive to reduce its airport handling charges both for passengers and 
baggage.
At London Stansted, its biggest base, Mr O'Leary said the number of check-in desks would be reduced from 50 at 
present to between five and 10 bag drops for luggage to be checked in for a fee.
The group is gaining an increasing share of its turn-over from ancillary revenues - including areas such as 
commission earnings on hotel, car hire and travel insurance bookings. They accounted for 22 per cent of total sales 
in the last quarter from October to December, up from 19 per cent a year earlier.

When nature calls at 30,000 feet, is $1.40 a wee price to pay? Or could it force passengers without correct change 
into a whole new kind of holding pattern?
The head of budget European airline Ryanair unleashed a flood of indignation and potty humor Friday when he 
suggested that future passengers might be obliged to insert a British pound coin for access to the lavatory to get 
some in-flight relief.
Airline chief Michael O'Leary suggested that installing pay toilets would lower ticket costs and make flying, 
somehow, easier for all.
Not even his own aides seemed to be sure if he was serious or pursuing his penchant for making brazen 
declarations to get free publicity for Ryanair.
"One thing we have looked at in the past, and are looking at again, is the possibility of maybe putting a coin slot on 
the toilet door, so that people might have to actually spend a pound to `spend a penny' in future," O'Leary said, 
using a British euphemism for going to the bathroom.
When asked during an interview on BBC Television what would happen if a customer really had to go but didn't 
have correct change, O'Leary dismissed the scenario as implausible.
"I don't think there's anybody in history (who has) gone on board a Ryanair aircraft with less than a pound," he said.
He cited the British currency even though Ireland and most of Europe uses euros.
O'Leary spokesman Stephen McNamara said his boss often spoke tongue in cheek but he then defended the idea 
of in-flight pay toilets as part of a logical trend.
"Michael makes a lot of this stuff up as he goes along and, while this has been discussed internally, there are no 
immediate plans to introduce it," McNamara said, adding, "Passengers using train and bus stations are already 
Airline pay toilets? Ignore that beverage cart
accustomed to paying to use the toilet, so why not on airplanes? Not everyone uses the toilet on board one of our 
flights, but those that do could help to reduce airfares for all passengers."
Analysts agreed that the man who pioneered charging passengers to check bags, to use a check-in desk and even 
to use a credit or debit card to make an online booking just might be serious about mile-high toilet extortion.
Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners in London, said there might be some truth to O'Leary's 
statement.
"This begs a simple question retort of: Is there absolutely nothing that this airline won't do? Not really, so if you are 
thinking about flying cattle-class Ryanair in future, beware," he said.
David Castelveter, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, which represents the major U.S. airlines, said he 
wasn't aware that any were considering a toilet fee.
Not surprisingly, passengers reacted with indignation and outrage at the prospect.
Vitaly Zananetskin, who was boarding a Ryanair flight to London at Riga International Airport in Latvia, called it "a 
bad idea."
"I would just try to go to the restroom before going on board and then try not to drink too much during the flight," he 
said. "A three-hour flight without a toilet is tolerable. Of course, if it gets so bad that your eyes are watering, then 
you can pay the money."
On the recession-hit streets of Dublin, Ryanair passengers waiting for an airport shuttle bus seemed resigned to the 
idea of paying for an O'Leary-provided potty.
"Your only choice with Ryanair, really, is not to fly Ryanair. Your dignity goes out the window. If you have a 
complaint, they're not programmed to care," said Samantha Jones, a 30-year-old Welsh woman.
She discounted the practicality of a restroom rebellion.
"If you are given a choice between wetting your knickers or not wetting your knickers, you will pay whatever fee 
they make you pay, and Mr. O'Leary knows this well," she said. "Frankly, I'm surprised he's talking about letting us 
have a wee for a pound, not more!"
Rochelle Turner, head of research at British consumer rights magazine Which? Holiday, said Ryanair had a well-
documented practice of "putting profit before the comfort of its customers" but this one could backfire.
"Charging people to go to the toilet might result in fewer people buying overpriced drinks on board. That would 
serve Ryanair right," she said.
Noah Cole of Portland, Ore., who has flown on Ryanair, called it "unconscionable" to charge for a bathroom, and he 
even predicted money-changing problems. In other words, if you only have dollars, can you still euro-nate?
"What if you don't have the requisite currency? Do you beg your seatmate for a euro so you can go to the 
bathroom?" Cole said in Dallas. "That's the nightmare scenario."
Associated Press writers Gary Peach in Riga, Latvia, and Airlines Writer David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this 
story.

Is a bathroom an optional extra when you're at 30,000 feet? Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary seems to think so and 
says his no-frills airline might charge customers to use its aircrafts' toilets.
O'Leary whipped up a frenzy of indignation and potty humor Friday as he suggested that future Ryanair passengers 
might be obliged to insert a British pound coin before they gain access to in-flight relief.
As always when introducing new charges, O'Leary suggested a separate toilet fee would lower ticket costs and 
make flying, somehow, easier for all. Nobody, even his own aides, seemed to be sure if he was serious or pursuing 
his well-documented penchant for making brazen declarations to win free advertising.
"One thing we have looked at in the past, and are looking at again, is the possibility of maybe putting a coin slot on 
the toilet door, so that people might have to actually spend a pound to `spend a penny' in future," O'Leary said, 
using a local euphemism for relieving one's self.
When asked, during an interview on BBC Television, what would happen if a customer really had to go, but didn't 
have the correct change, O'Leary dismissed the scenario as implausible. This even though Ireland and most of 
Europe uses euros, not the British currency, and even on-board attendants often find themselves without the 
correct change.
"I don't think there's anybody in history (who has) gone on board a Ryanair aircraft with less than a pound," he said.
Politicians and analysts agreed that the man who pioneered charging airline customers to check bags, to use a 
check-in desk, and even to use a credit or debit card to make an on-line booking just might be serious about mile-
high toilet extortion, too.
Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners in London, cautioned consumers that O'Leary might be 
attempting two for the price of one: Free publicity backed by cut-throat reality.
"This begs a simple question retort of: Is there absolutely nothing that this airline won't do? Not really, so if you are 
thinking about flying cattle-class Ryanair in future, beware," he said.

O'Leary's own chief spokesman, Stephen McNamara, said his boss often spoke tongue in cheek but then defended

documented practice of "putting profit before the comfort of its customers" but this one could backfire.
"Charging people to go to the toilet might result in fewer people buying overpriced drinks on board. That would 
serve Ryanair right," she said.
Tommy Broughan, transport spokesman for Ireland's Labour Party, said the toilet-charge idea had to be taken 
seriously.
He noted that Ryanair last month began threatening customers with €30 fines if they tried to carry on board a 
second bag regardless of size even one filled with a just-purchased item from the airport's duty-free shops.
"When Ryanair introduced this €30 extra duty-free charge, many passengers joked that next they would be charged 
for using the toilet not realizing that this indeed seems to be the newest extra charge on Ryanair's agenda," 
Broughan said.
On the recession-hit streets of Dublin, Ryanair-bound people waiting for the airport shuttle bus seemed resigned to 
the idea of paying for an O'Leary-provided potty.
"Your only choice with Ryanair, really, is not to fly Ryanair. Your dignity goes out the window. If you have a 
complaint, they're not programmed to care," said Samantha Jones, a 30-year-old Welsh woman who has been 
using the airline to commute between her weekday Irish job and weekend boyfriend back home near Liverpool.
Jones discounted the practicality of a restroom rebellion. "If you are given a choice between wetting your knickers 
or not wetting your knickers, you will pay whatever fee they make you pay, and Mr. O'Leary knows this well," she 
said. "Frankly, I'm surprised he's talking about letting us have a wee for a pound, not more!"

Comments by CEO Michael O'Leary that Ryanair might charge for using the toilet on its aircraft was played down 
by the airline today.
"Michael makes a lot of this stuff up as he goes along," said spokesman, Stephen McNamara.
"While this has been discussed internally there are no immediate plans to introduce it," he said.
The airline's boss, Michael O'Leary, is touting the idea of putting a coin slot on the toilet door as a means of raising 
"discretionary revenue". Last week, Ryanair announced plans to shut all check-in desks at airports and require 
passengers to check-in online in an effort to cut costs.

Stansted airport expansion timing in doubt
Stansted airport expansion timing in doubt

Body
The timing of the expansion of Stansted airport was thrown into doubt yesterday as opponents went to the high 
court to seek to overturn the government's recent backing for raising the limit on flights.
Airlines operating at the airport, led by Ryanair and EasyJet, as well as local campaigners, have also written to 
ministers seeking to postpone by up to a year the opening of the planning inquiry into BAA's plans to build a second 
runway and terminal at Stansted.
BAA won government approval last October to raise the limit on passenger capacity for the existing single runway 
by 40 per cent from 25m to 35m a year.
The Stop Stansted Expansion campaign began a three-day hearing in the high court yesterday to overturn the 
decision.
It is claiming the government breached the law by failing to take full account of the environmental and economic 
impact.
The public inquiry into the second runway and terminal, due to open in mid-April, is being threatened chiefly by the 
change of ownership of Stansted that is expected to be forced by the long-running investigation into BAA by the 
Competition Commission.
The competition watchdog is expected to call in its final report, due early next month, for the airports operator to be 
broken up, with the sale of three of its seven UK airports - Gatwick, Stansted and one of either Edinburgh or 
Glasgow.
BAA has already pre-empted the findings of the two-year probe by launching the sale of Gatwick, the second 
largest UK airport.
The process is well advanced and BAA has called for final, binding offers for Gatwick from a shortlist of three rival 
consortia by March 30 with the aim of completing the sale by late May.
Stansted airport expansion timing in doubt
At Stansted the ownership issue is overshadowing the plan to expand capacity, which the government has 
supported since the publication of the air transport white paper in December 2003.
The Stansted airlines consultative committee has written to Hazel Blears, communities and local government 
secretary, urging the postponement of the public inquiry by at least 12 months.

Ryanair today called on Transport Minister Noel Dempsey to sack Gary McGann from his position as Chairman of 
the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA).
Ryanair believes that Mr. McGann, who was a Non Executive Director and Chairman of the Board's Audit Sub 
Committee of Anglo Irish Bank, "failed to demonstrate any reasonable level of corporate governance over the 
management, or the published accounts of that bank".
"Given that the State has been forced to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank, at a cost of billions of euro to the tax payer, 
Ryanair believes that Mr. McGann is no longer an appropriate person to chair the Board of the DAA monopoly or 
provide it with corporate governance," Ryanair said.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "If Minister Dempsey is really concerned about improving 
corporate governance at the DAA and other semi state companies, then he should start by removing former 
directors of Anglo Irish Bank, where the absence of proper corporate governance and controls has done such 
damage to the image of Irish banking and Ireland, both at home and abroad." "When Mr. Sean Fitzpatrick resigned 
from the Board of Anglo Irish bank, he resigned from the Board of Aer Lingus at the same time. It is hard to 
understand why Mr. McGann, when he recently resigned from the Board of Anglo Irish Bank, didn't also resign from 
the Board of the Government owned Dublin Airport Authority as well."

Ryanair's new in-flight mobile phone service is an utter rip-off. It also makes a mockery of the EU's aim to reduce 
mobile phone bills.
The charges are as follows:  2 to  3 per minute to make or take a call, 50 cent per text and an astonishing  10 to  15 
per megabyte when browsing the internet.  10 to  15 per megabyte?
Many websites take two or three megabytes just to load once. So the price of logging on for a few seconds is  45! In 
this context, it is surreal for Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary to say, as he did at the launch last Thursday, 
that ''the big users here would be teenagers, people generally visiting friends and family''.
Teenagers?  45 to view one page? What planet is O'Leary living on? ''It's your choice whether you want to use it or 
not," said O'Leary.
Thankfully, Vodafone, 3 Ireland and Meteor have stayed away from this nonsense for the time being. Only O2 
customers might be tempted into using this interstellar rip-off.
Meanwhile, the very fact that such a service is being launched exposes what regulators and airlines have been 
touting for years: that mobiles are dangerous to a plane's navigation system. Quite simply, they are not: if they 
were, they would be confiscated upon entering the plane.
It is true that Ryanair's system is slightly different to an unfettered mobile service. It offers the service via picocell 
technology, lowering the radio interference levels. And only six mobile phones can be in use at any one time, 
according to Ryanair.
Nevertheless, the common position from regulators and airlines over the past decade has consistently been that 
any use of a mobile phone - taking a picture with it, for example - is ''dangerous'' to the plane's navigation.
Even after Thursday's launch, this is still the position of the Irish regulator and of Aer Lingus.
reality BYTES
Both of these parties, it will be remembered, persisted for years with the notion that iPods and laptops could be 
similarly dangerous. As far as I know, Aer Lingus still warns against the use of ''laser-controlled'' equipment such as 
DVD players or CD players. Other international airlines have long since admitted that this is nonsense.
But for Aer Lingus - in particular - it has always seemed much easier simply to ban them. It also plays nicely into a 
'safety-first' image that airlines have been chasing since 2001 (when iPods first came onto the mass market).
The truth, though, is that such luddite leanings mark airlines out to be unprogressive and unfriendly to business.
If I want to use my laptop, iPod or mobile phone functions when onboard, I should be allowed to do so. If they are 
genuinely dangerous, forbid their presence on board. But do not pretend that they could interfere with the plane's 
vital navigation system.

Highlight: Europe's first airline to start full service
O'Leary sees future revenue streams
Body
Ryanair gave inflight use of mobile phones on European airliners a significant boost yesterday when it launched a 
service that will be rolled out across its fleet.
Several other European airlines, including Air France-KLM, TAP Air Portgual and BMI British Midland, have 
conducted trials on single aircraft, but the Irish carrier has become the first to start equipping its entire fleet, totalling 
more than 170 aircraft.
The service enables passengers to make and receive calls and text messages on their own phones, and to send 
and receive e-mails and download attachments just as they would on the ground.
The service has been launched initially on more than 20 aircraft, mainly operating out of Ryanair's Dublin base, but 
Michael O'Leary, the chief executive, said the aim was to equip the whole fleet within 18 months.
The first 50 aircraft will be fitted within six months on a trial basis, but Mr O'Leary said he was confident it would 
then be extended to the rest of the fleet. The airline currently flies about 58m passengers a year.
The service is being provided by OnAir, a company 67 per cent owned by Sita, the aviation communications group, 
and 30 per cent by Airbus, the European aircraft maker. OnAir has been leading the effort to launch inflight mobile 
phone services against rivals such as AeroMobile, whose service is already being used by the Dubai-based 
Emirates airline on some long-haul services.
The inflight use of mobile phones remains controversial. Some passengers have regarded commercial aircraft as 
one of the last sanctuaries from the intrusion of ring tones and other people's irritating conversations.
However, British Airways is planning to offer inflight mobile phone services when it launches its all-business class 
route between London City airport and New York JFK in the autumn.
Ryanair opens skies to mobile phones
Initially, it will offer only text messaging and internet access from laptops fitted with mobile phone data cards. Voice 
calls may be allowed in the future, subject to customer demand and feedback. But Willie Walsh, BA's chief 
executive, said the airline's own customer surveys showed a clear majority were still against such a move because 
of the disturbance caused to other passengers.
Under the conditions agreed with the aviation safety authorities, inflight use of mobile phones will be possible only 
when the aircraft is flying at cruising altitudes above 10,000 feet, and the pilot will have the ability to switch off the 
service.
Ryanair said passengers would typically make and receive voice calls at non-EU international roaming rates - £1.50 
to £3 per minute, with text messages costing 40p-plus and e-mails £1 to £2 from mobiles and other smartphones.
Mr O'Leary said earnings from voice calls and text messages might remain relatively modest, but the use of mobile 
phones would eventually open up other important revenue streams from activities such as gambling, entertainment 
and advertising.

No-frills carrier, Ryanair, today launched its in-flight mobile phone service, initially onboard 20 of its mainly Dublin 
based aircraft.
This is the first step in fitting its entire fleet of over 170 aircraft to allow all passengers to make and receive mobile 
calls and texts on all Ryanair flights, it said.
Passengers on Ryanair's 20 OnAir enabled aircraft can now make and receive voice calls at non- EU international 
roaming rates ranging from E2 to E3 per minute.
Text messages will cost 50c-plus and emails will cost between E1 and E2 each using their mobile phones, 
BlackBerrys and other smartphones. The service will initially be available to "02" and "Vodafone" customers and to 
customers of over 50 other mobile phone operators across Europe. At the launch OnAir confirmed that it is working 
with other Irish mobile operators ("3" and "Meteor") to ensure that their customers can also keep in touch with the 
office, family and friends when travelling. Michael O'Leary said: "Today's launch by Ryanair and OnAir is the first 
step to offering in-flight mobile phone services onboard our entire fleet of over 170 aircraft over the next 18 months. 
This service will allow passengers to keep in touch with the office, family or friends. We expect customer demand 
for this service to grow rapidly."

No-frills carrier, Ryanair, today launched its in-flight mobile phone service, initially onboard 20 of its mainly Dublin 
based aircraft.
This is the first step in fitting its entire fleet of over 170 aircraft to allow all passengers to make and receive mobile 
calls and texts on all Ryanair flights, it said.
Passengers on Ryanair's 20 OnAir enabled aircraft can now make and receive voice calls at non- EU international 
roaming rates ranging from E2 to E3 per minute.
Text messages will cost 50c-plus and emails will cost between E1 and E2 each using their mobile phones, 
BlackBerrys and other smartphones. The service will initially be available to "02" and "Vodafone" customers and to 
customers of over 50 other mobile phone operators across Europe. At the launch OnAir confirmed that it is working 
with other Irish mobile operators ("3" and "Meteor") to ensure that their customers can also keep in touch with the 
office, family and friends when travelling. Michael O'Leary said: "Today's launch by Ryanair and OnAir is the first 
step to offering in-flight mobile phone services onboard our entire fleet of over 170 aircraft over the next 18 months. 
This service will allow passengers to keep in touch with the office, family or friends. We expect customer demand 
for this service to grow rapidly."

Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, said yesterday it was cutting 50 jobs and scrapping 10 summer tourist routes 
from Liverpool airport because of the weak pound and rising passenger taxes. The company said it would withdraw 
one of its seven aircraft from Liverpool and cut services by 14 per cent. It expected an 8 per cent fall in passengers 
from 2.7m in 2008 to 2.5m this year.

INVESTIGATION DAVID KAMINSKI-MORROW loNDon
Engine teardown to look at birdstrike similarities
Investigators are stripping down the engines of a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 to examine the extent of damage caused 
when the jet struck birds on approach to Rome Ciampino three months ago.
As many as 90 starlings hit the aircraft as it prepared to land on 10 November, says the Italian investigation 
authority ANSV.
There is particular interest in the inquiry, it says, because both CFM International CFM56 engines were struck and 
the incident bears "similarity" with the dual loss of thrust experienced by the US Airways Airbus A320 that hit birds 
before ditching in New York's Hudson river.
Both the Ryanair 737 and the US Airways A320 were fitted with CFM56s. ANSV says the teardown of the 737's 
powerplants will take place at GE Aviation's UK facilities in Cardiff. Some 20 personnel connected with the 
investigation will be in attendance.
"The aim is to verify in detail the damage suffered by both engines, to understand better the engines' performance 
following the birds' ingestion," says the investigation authority.
"Because the same type of engines were involved in both events, the teardown activity is of utmost importance, to 
gather data to see whether any commonality may exist between the two events."
All 172 passengers and crew survived the hard landing on 10 November last year that followed the Ciampino 
birdstrike, but the 737 was badly damaged. Sources close to the investigation say that, when the crew sighted a 
huge flock of starlings - an estimated 1,000 birds - they initiated a go-around, but the birds rose into the flightpath 
and the aircraft suffered a considerable loss of power on both engines.
INTRODUCTION:
Within 30s of the pilots' first sighting the birds, the aircraft had made a hard landing and came to a halt on the 
runway.

Airbus and Boeing have suffered a poor start to the year commercially, with net orders in deficit after a raft of 
cancellations, amid a repetition of warnings that a prompt cut in output is needed.
The two airframers booked a total of 22 orders in January, but suffered 43 cancellations, resulting in a net tally of 
minus 21 aircraft.
Airbus secured orders for four A321s from Turkish Airlines, but posted 12 cancellations - three A318s and A320s, 
two A319s and four A321s - giving it a net deficit of eight jets.
Boeing took orders for 18 737s from Ryanair and Southwest Airlines, but lost 31 787s through the cancellation of 
orders from S7 Airlines and lessor LCAL, resulting in a net deficit of 13 aircraft.
Despite concerns over the state of the market, both airframers continue to plan record output of around 950 airliners 
this year. But International Lease Finance chief executive Steven Udvar-Hazy has reiterated his forecast that output 
will have to fall sharply in the coming months.
The Seattle Times reports that Hazy sees jet production dropping by 30-35% over the next 18 months: "By the 
fourth quarter, we could definitely see some adjustments. I'd like to see it sooner."
Hazy also expects a massive decline in orders this year - possibly ending with a net negative tally. "It could happen 
that this will be the year when net cancellations and deferrals actually exceed the number of new aircraft orders," he 
says. "Airlines are focused on survival. Ordering new airplanes is not the flavour of the month."
Airbus said in January it expects its gross orders will be in the 300-400 unit range this year, while Boeing forecasts 
that its "book-to-build" ratio will be less than one - in other words it will sell fewer aircraft than the 480 it plans to

output, what is unknown is how many of this year's planned shipments are being affected by deferrals.

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair is in talks with both Boeing and Airbus to order 200 planes for as much as USD7 
billion with delivery starting in 2013, CEO Michael O'Leary said.
Ryanair is not in advanced talks with either of the two on the order and is happy to wait until the plane makers' 
"order book collapses" to negotiate a better deal, he said.
The planes have a sticker price of about USD70 million each but Ryanair expects to negotiate at least a 50 percent 
discount to pay about USD35-USD40 million each for a total order of roughly USD7 billion, he said.
"The sticker price is USD70 million, but we would never dream of paying anything like that," he told reporters after a 
news conference on the airline's plans in Italy. Despite Ryanair's historic relationship with Boeing, O'Leary said he 
would order planes from Airbus if they offered a cheaper price. In that case, Ryanair would simply designate some 
of its airport bases as those for Airbus planes, he said. The planes would be delivered between 2013 and 2016, he 
said. Ryanair has a fleet of 171 Boeing 737-800, and has firm orders to bring that up to 310 planes by 2012, he 
said.

Virgin Atlantic, the airline controlled by Sir Richard Branson, and Ireland's Ryan-air announced job cuts yesterday in 
response to the deepening recession.
Virgin said it was planning to cut up to 600 jobs, or 7 per cent of its workforce, while Ryanair is cutting 200 jobs at 
its Dublin base.
The British long-haul airline has reduced capacity by 1-2 per cent in the winter season and said yesterday it was 
planning to reduce capacity by 7-10 per cent in the next 12 months.
That comes on top of freezing pay from March. Steve Ridgway, chief executive, said: "No airline is immune from the 
recession and we continue to reshape our business to ensure we're in the best position for the longer term."
In the face of falling demand, the group was taking a variety of further measures to cut costs, such as offering 
unpaid leave.
The airline said it was consulting with its 8,400 employees, including 4,500 cabin crew and 800 pilots, "about the 
possibility of up to 600 redundancies across the business". It was seeking ways to "protect as many jobs as 
possible and avoid compulsory redundancies".
Virgin Atlantic said last month it expected to make a profit in the financial year to the end of February, helped by 
earlier cost cutting and the deferral of aircraft deliveries.
It has been running a discounted fare sale to stimulate traffic and generate cash with low fares. Mr Ridgway warned 
that the fare reductions meant lower revenues this year. "We have to reduce our costs and capacity as a result," he 
said.
Ryanair, the leading European low-cost carrier, said it was planning to make the first ever cut in operations at 
Dublin airport, one of its largest European bases, in anticipation of weaker demand.
Virgin and Ryanair to cut jobs
The airline said the fall in passenger numbers would be exacerbated by Irish government plans to introduce a tax of 
EUR10 per departing passenger from March 30 and by the rising charges levied at Dublin airport.
Ryanair said it expected passenger numbers at Dublin to fall 19 per cent to 8.7m in the next financial year to March 
2010.
It was planning to reduce the number of aircraft based in Dublin from 22 to 18 and there would be a cut of about 
200 jobs.
The new passenger tax and higher airport fees would make Ireland a more expensive destination and render it 
uncompetitive compared with other parts of Europe, Ryanair said.

Shares in Irish Life and Permanent jumped by 8pc this morning after the resignation of two senior executives in the 
row over deposits by the bank in Anglo Irish.
The bank's board last night accepted the resignation of group finance director Peter Fitzpatrick and of its head of 
group treasury David Gantly.
But it turned down an offer of resignation by group chief executive Denis Casey.
The bank's shares gained 14c in early deals this morning to 179. It wa sa mixed morning for the Dublin market's two 
other banks, as investors mull whether this week's E7bn bailout by the government will be enough to see them

Ryanair is to cut back on flights from Dublin Airport that will result in 200 job losses among pilots and cabin crew.
It blamed high Airport charges and the Government's E10 travel tax for the cutbacks.
Ryanair added that the Dublin Airport Authority's monthly traffic is now running some 9pc behind the previous year 
with a loss of 150,000 passengers a month or nearly two million passengers a year.
The cutbacks at Dublin will see a 20pc cut in Dublin-based aircraft, an 18pc cut in staff rotations from over 700 to 
under 600 and a 20pc drop in Ryanair's traffic from 10.8 million to 8.7 million passengers in 2009/2010, it said. 
"Further cuts in Ryanair's Dublin winter schedule will be announced later," it added. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: 
"The combination of the DAA's high costs, and awful facilities has already created a traffic collapse at Dublin Airport 
this winter (December traffic fell by 9pc with 150,000 fewer passengers). The decision by the Irish Government to 
introduce a flat rate E10 tourist tax from April is nothing less than "tourism suicide". This travel tax when introduced 
(appropriately on April Fools Day) will exacerbate the traffic decline at Dublin, as price sensitive visitors will avoid 
Ireland and choose other lower cost destinations." "Ryanair has repeatedly called for this tax to be made fairer by 
making it a percentage of the air fare paid, or alternatively why not scrap the tax altogether and generate equivalent 
savings by closing quangos like Tourism Ireland and Failte Ireland which spend over E150m p.a., but deliver few if 
any visitors."

Budget airline Ryanair on Thursday threatened to lay off 200 employees if the Irish government imposes a new tax 
on outbound flights from Ireland's airports next month.
The carrier said traffic through Dublin Airport, the nation's busiest, was down 9 percent compared to last year, and 
said it believed that decline would "accelerate on 30th March next when the Irish government's idiotic €10 ($12.80) 
tourist tax is introduced."
Ryanair said it was prepared to cut the number of aircraft based in Dublin from 22 to 18.
"These cuts can and will be reversed if the government's suicidal €10 tourism tax is reversed on or before 30th 
March," said Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive.
"This travel tax has already failed in the UK and Dutch markets, where they caused traffic declines and sadly the 
Irish government's tourist tax is doomed to a similar failure. This government must realize you can only promote 
tourism by welcoming visitors, not taxing them," O'Leary added.

Air passenger numbers drop 6.3%
Air passenger numbers drop 6.3%

Body
The number of passengers using UK airports fell sharply in January, as demand for air travel continued to fall and 
airlines cut capacity and removed some unprofitable routes.
The sharp traffic decline along with the problems for potential bidders of raising debt finance are making the sale of 
BAA airports, led by the disposal of Gatwick, a fraught process for the UK group and Ferrovial of Spain, its majority 
ownerFerrovial.
BAA, which operates seven UK airports, said it handled 9.4m passengers in January, a 6.3 per cent decline from 
the same month in 2008 and the tenth successive year-on-year decline in monthly passenger numbers. The 
number of flights to and from the seven airports, which include Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, fell 7.5 per cent 
year-on-year in January.
The decline in air traffic is hitting BAA at a very difficult time, as it seeks to find a buyer for Gatwick, the second 
busiest airport in the UK, and shortly before the Competition Commission is expected to demand that it should also 
sell Stansted and either Edinburgh or Glasgow airports. The competition watchdog, which is expected to publish the 
final report on its investigation into BAA within weeks, believes that the group's monopoly of the leading airports in 
London and Scotland should be broken up in order to foster more competition in the airports market.
The BAA traffic figures released yesterday showed that both Gatwick and Stansted were being hit hard by falling 
passenger and flight volumes.
At Gatwick the number of passengers handled last month fell 10.8 per cent year-on-year as the grip of recession 
tightened. By comparison passenger volumes in the 12 months to January at 33.9m were 3.6 per cent lower than a 
year earlier. Traffic at Gatwick has been falling steeply year-on-year since September.
The airport has been affected by the transfer of a large number of its US long-haul services to Heathrow as a result 
of the US-European Union "open skies" treaty, which opened Heathrow to full competition for all US and European 
carriers for the first time in March last year. Some of its carriers also collapsed into bankruptcy last year. Both 
Air passenger numbers drop 6.3%
American Airlines and Continental Airlines have closed their Gatwick bases, and British Airways has transferred 
several US long-haul services from Gatwick to Heathrow and is shrinking its short-haul operations.
Gatwick is proving increasingly attractive for the low-cost carriers, however, with EasyJet adding new routes from 
the airport and Aer Lingus setting up its first operating base outside the island of Ireland at the airport.
Traffic at Stansted airport, the most important airport for low-cost airlines in Europe, is also being hit hard, 
particularly by the reduction of capacity at Ireland's Ryanair during the winter months.
Volumes have been falling at Stansted for 15 months in succession, also undermining the timing of BAA's plans to 
build a second runway there. The group said passenger numbers at Stansted fell 11.2 per cent year-on year to 
1.29m in January, representing a 19 per cent decline in two years.

Irish bank shares fell heavily in early trade this morning, ahead of an expected announcement later today of a big 
bailout by the government.
AIB was down 10c to 106 a short time ago, with Bank of Ireland off by 6c to 64.
The latest falls reflect market concern that the government may reveal only the first stage of a bailout programme, 
with E7bn in preference shares for the two big banks.
A further stage, involving a "bad bank" or atoxic debt insurance scheme, is almost certain to be postponed to later. 
The fall in the bank's shares also reflected a global slide by financial stocks after disappointment at yesterday's

Irish Life and Permanent shed 15c to 200 this morning even through it is not involved in the Irish recapitalisation.

Body
Ryanair is preparing to take a fresh  60 million write-off in relation to its shareholding in Aer Lingus when it 
publishes its results for the year to March. The airline wrote off over  90 million in its accounts last year, after the 
value of its 29per cent stake plummeted thanks to Aer Lingus's falling share price.
Aer Lingus shares traded below  1 last week, 29per cent below the  1.40 per share offered by Ryanair when it 
launched its second takeover attempt late last year, and 64 per cent below the  2.80 it had offered in 2006.
Ryanair, which announced a third quarter loss of  102 million last week, said it would face a  63 million impairment 
charge at the end of March if the Aer Lingus share price remained at its current levels.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said last week that Ryanair planned to remain a significant minority shareholder in 
the former state airline, and repeated previous warnings to other Aer Lingus shareholders that there was no 
certainty that Ryanair would make any further takeover attempts in future.
Ryanair's stake was valued last week at just over  150 million, despite having been worth more than  350 million at 
one point. O'Leary also said last week that Ryanair passengers would be hit with increased baggage charges within 
weeks, as the airline planned to encourage more passengers to travel with carry-on bags only. The airline plans to 
have less than 25 per cent of passengers checking in bags in the coming months.

Highlight: The Week

Body
The heaviest snowfall for 18 years threatened to bring UK plc to a standstill at the beginning of the week. Business 
groups estimated the cost to the economy could reach £1bn in lost productivity.
As the snow began to thaw in the capital, the government took further steps to repair the damage to the financial 
system. Lord Mandelson warned against "exorbitant" bonuses in the sector and the Bank of England cut interest 
rates by another half a percentage point to a 315-year low of 1 per cent.
Travel & Leisure
Ryanair , Europe's biggest low-cost airline, said it had begun talks with Boeing and Airbus about an order of 300-
400 short-haul jets - one of the largest ever purchases of new aircraft.
The Irish carrier said it expected to place the order within 18-24 months to make the most of the weakening 
commercial aerospace market. But Airbus said it was unwilling to contemplate the scale of discounts being sought 
by Ryanair and refused to be drawn into a bidding war against Boeing for the multi-billion dollar order.
General Retailers
Baugur , the Icelandic investment group that has stakes in many British high street chains, verged on the edge of 
collapse after Landsbanki decided to call in its £1bn debt.
The Icelandic bank called in PwC as fixed charged receivers over the group's stakes in the Iceland supermarket 
chain, House of Fraser department stores, Hamleys toy shop and Aurum jewellery business.
The fashion billionaire Philip Green and private equity firm Alchemy have expressed interest in some of Baugur's 
assets.  John Lewis  said it had been forced to scale down its expansion plans as property developers delay 
projects to build regional shopping centres. Before the onset of the financial crisis, the chain had eight new stores in 
the pipeline and said some would be postponed.
The Week
The group is dependent on developers for new store locations, at which it is normally offered rent-free incentives, 
so it now has to rethink its development programme.
JD Sports Fashion  reported that revenue growth over the Christmas period had continued into January, contrary 
to its previous predictions. The upmarket sportswear chain said many of its customers were teenagers who were 
largely unaffected by the recession and were still determined to get hold of the latest fashions.
Mining
Rio Tinto , the heavily indebted mining group, revealed it had held talks with Chinalco about the potential sale of 
convertible bonds and stakes in various operating businesses to the state-owned Chinese aluminium producer.
The Anglo-Australian group had pledged to cut its $37bn (£25bn) debt burden by $10bn by the end of this year and 
analysts concluded the Chinalco deal would mean it could reach that target without a rights issue.
Telecoms
Vodafone raised its profit guidance for the full-year in spite of deteriorating performance at its Spanish and Turkish 
operations. The mobile operator said sterling's weakness against other currencies meant operating profit guidance 
had been increased by £500m to a range of £11.5bn-£12bn for 2008-09.
Insurance
Aviva , Britain's biggest insurer, said it would cut the £1bn pay-out it had previously promised to policyholders.
Last July, the company had announced a deal to free up surplus capital that had built up in its life fund over 
decades, meaning that policyholders would receive an average of £1,000 each.
Following recent market turmoil, the group said payments would be reduced to reflect "substantial reductions in the 
value of equity and property investments" but could not yet specify by how much.
Oil & Gas
BP  warned of "a much more challenging environment" ahead, in spite of announcing record profits of $25.6bn for 
2008. Plummeting crude prices have begun to take their effect, causing net income at Europe's second-largest oil 
company to drop by 24 per cent in the fourth quarter.
While the price of oil for immediate delivery has remained close to $40 per barrel over the past two months, longer-
dated futures prices have been moving lower. Analysts suggested that the increased pressure on oil companies 
could trigger off a fresh round of mergers.
Food Producers
Unilever , which owns brands such as PG Tips and Vaseline, scrapped its profit guidance for this year and declined 
to reaffirm its 2010 target of increasing margins by 15 per cent.
The announcement from the Anglo-Dutch group, traditionally thought to be a defensive investment, followed similar 
decisions at GlaxoSmithKline and raised concerns about other consumer goods companies.

British Airways has plunged into the red for its third quarter.
The dive leaves the airline with a pretax loss of £70m for the first nine months of the year, down from a profit of 
£816m a year ago.
The carrier, which said late last month that it would make a £150m operating loss for the full year due to a weak 
economy and a weak pound, said it was increasing sales activity in areas where currencies are strong and was 
reviewing its cost base.
"We continue to review every aspect of the business to control costs while at the same time improving the customer 
experience and operation," Chief Executive Willie Walsh said in a statement. The carrier reaffirmed its full-year 
revenue guidance of at least 4 percent year on year, while its nine-month profit came in at £89m at the operating 
level, down from a restated £744m a year ago. BA is still in merger talks with Spanish partner Iberia more than six 
months after discussions were announced, but representatives of both parties have recently said March could be 
the month to expect more concrete news. Rival Air France-KLM also issued a profit warning last month, but the last 
of the big three full-service European carriers, Lufthansa, surprised the market earlier in the week by raising its 
2008 profit forecast. Low-cost carriers easyJet and Ryanair have also increased recent forecasts, saying travellers 
are trading downwards during the recession. BA also said on Friday its passenger numbers fell 1.3 percent year-on-
year, while its load factor -- an indication of how many paying seats were filled as a percentage of capacity -- was 
up 1 percent at 73.2 percent. Its yield -- the average revenue per passenger carried and kilometre flown -- rose 9.6 
percent to 6.95 pence. (c) Reuters

Banks have been the big beneficiaries around the world to the growing hope that the US Senate will today adopt

The upbeat mood reflects a hope that the package will get the banking sector moving again.

Failure to de-ice access ramps and routes for trucks to re-fuel aircraft has seriously disrupted flights at Dublin 
airport this morning, according to Ryanair.
The no-frills airline slammed Dublin Airport Authority for overlooking access routes to service aircraft and called on 
the Authority to compensate passengers.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said "Ryanair today calls on the DAA to explain why a fundamental part of its 
operation had been overlooked by this incompetent government monopoly. Passengers now face delays and 
cancellations which are as a direct result of the failure to ensure that ramps and access routes are accessible to 
fuel trucks. Since early morning we have had aircraft sitting on stands but have no way of refuelling them. The 
longer these aircraft sit on stand the more they impact on arrivals. This total shambles is the making of the DAA 
monopoly and call on them to compensate passengers for the costs which they now face as a result of their claims 
that the airport was operating normally when they failed to ensure aircraft could depart the airport".

Body
British Airways blamed the economy as it posted a loss before tax of £70 million and re-iterated its expectation of a 
£150 million loss for the year.
Reporting the airline's results for the last nine months of 2008 chief executive Willie Walsh said that the economic 
weakness and fall in sterling were behind the losses, which compare with a profit of £816 million in 2007.
However, shares were among the top risers as the results had been pre-empted by a previous statement at the end 
of January which flagged up the losses.
Today BA also announced that its passenger numbers continued to fall in January, down 2.6%, with premium traffic 
particularly hard hit.
More staff could also lose their jobs, with BA having entered talks with the trade unions about pay and productivity. 
'We continue to review every aspect of the business to control costs while at the same time improving the customer 
experience and operation,' Walsh said.
The weak pound put a serious dent in BA's fuel bill, which rose 48.4% in the nine month period as the average 
market price of fuel soared.
BA's weak numbers come in stark contrast to some of its peers, with Lufthansa earlier this week raising its forecast 
for full year profits, and both Easyjet and Ryanair reporting rises in traffic numbers.
BA maintained its guidance for an operating loss of around £150 million for the year, which it had already 
announced at the end of January.
By 09:00am, BA was up 5.4% or 6.9p, at 134.5p.

Airbus has snubbed an effort by Ryanair, the low-cost airline, to draw it into a bidding contest against Boeing for the 
carrier's next multi-billion dollar order for several hundred short-haul jets.
The European aircraft maker is unwilling to contemplate the scale of discounts being sought by Ryanair, which has 
established a reputation as one of the most aggressive negotiators of low-cost supply deals in the industry.
Airbus's reluctance to enter the preliminary bidding for the Ryanair order is highly unusual given traditionally fierce 
competition between the duopoly manufacturers of big commercial jets above 100 seats.
The two groups vie for annual bragging rights as the leading commercial aircraft maker, a position held by Airbus. 
The order volumes from Ryanair, if not the profits, represent a prize given that the Irish carrier is poised to become 
Europe's biggest short-haul airline by passenger numbers.
This week Ryanair said it was in early talks with Boeing and Airbus about an order for 300-400 short-haul jets, one 
of the biggest purchases of new aircraft.
Michael Cawley, Ryanair deputy chief executive and chief operating officer, said he expected the group to place the 
order within 18-24 months to take advantage of the weakening commercial aerospace market.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, and senior colleagues have visited Airbus headquarters in Toulouse to 
outline their plans, but the European group, the commercial aircraft division of EADS, has told the airline it is not 
interested at the prices Ryanair is seeking.
John Leahy, Airbus chief commercial officer, said: "We are not in discussions with Ryanair about aircraft. That is on 
the record. We don't have plans to enter a sales campaign with Ryanair, which would be very expensive and very 
time-consuming."
The Irish carrier is seeking to repeat its coup of six years ago, when it placed its previous biggest order for 100 
aircraft and a further 50 options in January 2002, close to the bottom of the last aviation recession.
Airbus snubs Ryanair
It was the biggest order Boeing had received for its 737 jets, and Ryanair secured one of the largest discounts 
agreed by the US aircraft maker, which was then desperate for new orders.
Boeing and Airbus have said they expect new orders to fall this year to roughly a quarter of the peak combined 
industry level of more than 2,800 new orders won in 2007.
Ryanair has a single type fleet of 181 Boeing 737-800s. This is due to rise to 292 by March 2012, based on its 
existing firm orders.
It is looking to secure a delivery stream through the next decade to replace older jets and to allow for   expansion.

Ryanair today said it will reduce its Shannon based aircraft numbers from 6 to 4 and reduce its route network at 
Shannon from 30 to 25.
It claims that up to 800 jobs will be lost in the region because of the cuts.
The airline blamed what it called the Government's unfair E10 travel tax for a massive drop in tourism numbers to 
the region for the route reduction.
"Ryanair regrets that this 100pc rate of tax leaves it with no alternative other than to reduce its aircraft numbers, 
routes, flights and traffic to/from Shannon from 30th March," it said. It will cut its weekly Shannon flights from 136 to 
116 flights and reduce its Shannon traffic from 1.9m to 1.2m in the first year, Ryanair said. "These cuts will result in 
over 100 Ryanair jobs at Shannon being transferred to other bases. The loss of 700,000 passengers will also give 
rise to the loss of approximately 700 support jobs in and around Shannon Airport," it said.

Aer Lingus expects to report a net loss for 2008, according to the airline's chairman Colm Barrington in an interview 
this morning.
Barrington tells the Irish Independent that the company will book a charge for restructuring in 2008.
When asked if that would lead to net losses in 2008, he told the paper: "If you take it we said we're going to be 
about breakeven in 2008, and you're going to have the exceptionals in 2008, then yes, obviously, logically."
Last month, Aer Lingus said it expected to report a net profit for 2008, despite an operating loss of approximately 20 
million euros. Arch-rival Ryanair last month walked away from a 1.4 euro a share bid for Aer Lingus after Ireland's 
government, which owns 25 percent of the former state carrier, rejected the offer on competition grounds. Aer 
Lingus's shares closed at 95 cents euro last night. (c) Reuters

Airports say Ryanair policy hurting their sales

Airports complained Wednesday that Ryanair's new rule limiting passengers to one carryon bag will discourage 
airport shopping and hurt their revenues.
The European branch of Airports Council International, which represents some 440 members in Europe, said 
airlines "need to appreciate" that airports make at least half their income from retail sales and that this allows them 
charge below-cost landing fees.
Europe's biggest low-fare airline, Ryanair Holdings PLC, said passengers were free to shop at the airport as long as 
their purchases fit into one 22-pound (10-kilogram) carryon bag.
It also said airports had plenty of room to cut costs by operating more efficiently.
"Passengers have no interest in airport shopping," Ryanair said. "They simply want to get through airport terminals 
and onto their aircraft with the shortest possible queuing time and inconvenience."
The airports did not say how much they expected to lose in sales from Ryanair's new rule, which went into force on 
Sunday.
Ryanair said it will charge passengers €30 ($39) if they bring more than one handbag, briefcase or laptop bag on 
board.
Passenger traffic is falling worldwide as a global downturn forces people to cut back on travel. The worldwide office 
of ACI in Geneva estimates European passenger traffic in December fell by 6.5 percent compared with the same 
month in 2007.

Ryanair today reacted angrily to an assertion from trade body, Airports Council Europe (ACI), that the Irish no-frills 
carrier's stringent baggage allowance rules are stopping passengers from buying duty free.
ACI said that Ryanair's 'one bag' rule prevents passengers of the discount carrier from carrying additional duty-free 
purchases on board and are undermining airport revenues.
Ryanair, which introduced the rule last month, charges passengers E30 if they bring on board more than one piece 
of hand luggage, "effectively restricting passengers who might otherwise buy perfumes and alcohol in duty-free 
shops," ACI asserted.
Olivier Jankovec, the director-general of the Airports Council Europe, labelled the rule "short-sighted" and said 
Ryanair's policy is "simply not a tenable position". Many of the claims made in ACI's press release were described 
by Ryanair as "rubbish". "Ryanair's "one bag" carry-on rule prohibits no passengers from carrying duty free on 
board; it simply has to be packed into the passenger's generous 10kg carry-on bag," said Ryanair. It added that 
less than 5pc of Ryanair's 800 plus routes operate outside the European Union and "therefore the quantities of duty 
free purchased by Ryanair passengers is negligible".

Ryanair has denied that a new "one bag rule is killing off the tradition of bringing home duty frees.
The claim was made by trade body Airports Council Europe which hit out at a new 30 euro charge on passengers

The airline permits passengers one piece of on-board luggage, but since last month has been treating a duty free 
bag as a second item.

By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 3.33 points to 3,320.40.
European shares slipped this morning, with BP's weaker-than-expected results dragging down the energy sector,

Higher fuel costs push carrier into third-quarter loss

Ryanairfell heavily into loss in the three months from October to December largely due a surge in its fuel costs.
It forecast yesterday it would return to significant profit in the next financial year to March 2010, however, due to the 
steep fall in the oil price in recent months and in spite of a sharp drop in average fares. Ryanair shares rose by 2.8 
per cent in afternoon Dublin trading to EUR2.96.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said lower fuel costs meant its current fourth-quarter loss would be lower 
than expected, in spite of a 20 per cent drop in average fares. It raised its forecast for the full year to March from a 
break-even result to a net profit of EUR50m-EUR80m ($64m-$102m) before one-off charges.
It will still incur a heavy net loss this year, including exceptional items such as the writedown on the value of its 29.8 
per cent stake in bid target Aer Lingus.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would return to "substantial profitability" in the coming financial year to March 2010 thanks 
to the lower oil price and in spite of a forecast 10 per cent drop in fares.
The airline was "poised for substantial traffic and profit growth" in the coming year, as the recession forced "millions 
of passengers to focus on price," said Mr O'Leary.
The group has chosen to drive down fares in order to try to fill seats in its still growing fleet and to capture market 
share as many other airlines retrench in the face of the deepening recession.
It reported a EUR128.7m pre-tax loss for the third quarter, including exceptional charges of EUR17.3m, a big 
reverse from a pre-tax profit of EUR50.5m in the same period a year ago.
Average fares fell by 9 per cent to EUR34m as a result of a series of discounted seat sales, while fuel costs rose by 
71 per cent to EUR328m. Ryanair was hit hard by having hedged its fuel requirements for the quarter at levels well 
above the prevailing oil price in the quarter.

Airline aims to grab market share
Plans to buy up to 400 more aircraft
Body
Michael O'Leary is keeping the throttle open despite the deepening recession.
While rival EasyJet takes a more cautious stance towards fleet expansion, the Ryanair chief executive is sticking to 
a tested formula of making a grab for market share in a downturn.
As competitors retrench and some go out of business, Mr O'Leary believes Ryanair's position as the lowest cost, 
lowest fare operator in Europe will allow it to continue to expand.
Michael Cawley, Ryanair's deputy chief executive and chief operating officer, said yesterday that the airline was in 
early talks with Boeing and Airbus about an order for as many as 300-400 more aircraft to be placed in the next 18-
24 months.
Ryanair's current deliveries end in 2012 and the new orders would satisfy its expansion plans through the next 
decade.
The airline says that there is still room to grow, as new markets in Europe open up and weaker rivals are 
shouldered aside.
Ryanair has 31 operating bases around Europe and Mr Cawley said the airline was expecting to make further 
headway in Italy, Spain and Scandinavia, where local operators are being forced to retrench.
The airline said yesterday that it had fallen heavily into the red in the three months from October to December when 
it suffered a EUR128.7m (£116m) pre-tax loss compared with a profit of EUR50.5m in the same period a year ago.
Ryanair still targets expansion
That decline was largely a result of a surge in fuel costs and the impact from hedging fuel requirements at levels 
much higher than the prevailing oil price.
But it raised expectations for the full year from a break-even result to a net profit of between EUR50m and EUR80m 
before one-off charges, lifting the shares 18 cents to EUR3.04 yesterday.
The final quarter will be better than expected because of lower fuel costs and despite a 20 per cent fall in average 
fares, Ryanair said.
The airline will still incur a heavy net loss for the full year, including exceptional items such as a significant 
writedown on the value of its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, the rival Irish airline.
But Mr O'Leary said it would return to "substantial profitability" in the next financial year to March 2010 thanks to the 
lower oil price and a big increase in traffic. The recession was forcing "millions of passengers to focus on price", he 
added, even though "the general economic environment remains extremely difficult."
Passenger numbers in the third quarter rose 13 per cent from 12.4m to 14m, while turnover increased 6 per cent 
from EUR569.4m to EUR604.5m.
The airline is gaining an increasing share of its turnover from ancillary revenues, including areas such as 
commission earnings on hotel, car hire and travel insurance bookings.
That accounted for a combined 22 per cent of sales in the quarter, up from 19 per cent a year ago. Ancillary 
revenues rose 19 per cent to EUR132m.
Ryanair said that it planned to launch inflight use of mobile phones at the end of February on 20 Dublin-based 
aircraft and the six-month trial should be extended to about 40 aircraft by the end of the summer.
Initial revenues would be small, but it expected in-flight communications to become a "strong source" of growth in 
ancillary revenues in coming years.
Ryanair said it had hedged three-quarters of its fuel requirements for April-to- September and 50 per cent from 
October-to-December at an average price of $650 a tonne, which was 38 per cent lower than the average $1,050 a 
tonne paid in the current financial year.
After two unsuccessful takeover bids for Aer Lingus Mr O'Leary said it was "doubtful" Ryanair would "waste any 
further management time or resources making another offer." It could be hit by a further impairment charge of 
EUR63.3m in the current final quarter, if the Aer Lingus share price remains at the present level.

Highlight: Airbus and Boeing to contest contracts
Irish carrier seeking to exploit downturn
Body
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, is in early talks with Boeing and Airbus about an order for 300-400 short-
haul jets, one of the biggest purchases of new aircraft.
Michael Cawley, deputy chief executive and chief operating officer for Ryanair, said he expected the group to place 
the order within 24 months to take advantage of the weakening commercial aerospace market.
The Irish carrier is seeking to repeat its coup of six years ago, when it ordered 100 aircraft and another 50 options 
in January 2002, close to the bottom of the last aviation recession.
It was the biggest order Boeing had received for its 737 jets. Ryan-air secured one of the largest discounts agreed 
by the US aircraft maker, which was desperate for orders.
Both Boeing and Airbus have said they expect orders to plunge this year to about a quarter of the peak combined 
industry level of more than 2,800 orders in 2007.
Ryanair has a single type fleet of 181 Boeing 737-800s. That is due to rise to 292 by March 2012 based on existing 
firm orders. It recently exercised options for 13 more jets for delivery in 2011 and has 10 options remaining.
It is halfway through a plan to double its fleet and passenger numbers between 2007 and 2012. Passenger volumes 
are scheduled to grow from 43m in the year to March 2007 to 87m in the year to March 2012, when Ryanair will 
have become the biggest short-haul carrier in Europe.
The potential order will trigger a fierce contest between Boeing and Airbus. Mr Cawley said that, given the airline's 
size, the group would be happy to move to a mixed Airbus/Boeing fleet.
In the last downturn EasyJet wrung big price concessions out of Airbus to switch from an all-Boeing fleet. The 
strategies of Ryanair and EasyJet are diverging sharply, however.

The low-cost carrier is seeking a big discount from Boeing and Airbus, writes Kevin Done
Body
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, is in early talks with Boeing and Airbus about placing an order for 300-
400 short-haul jets, one of the biggest-ever purchases of new aircraft.
Michael Cawley, Ryanair deputy chief executive and chief operating officer, said yesterday he expected the group 
to place the order within 18-24 months to take advantage of the rapidly weakening commercial aerospace market.
The Irish carrier is seeking to repeat its coup of six years ago, when it placed its previous biggest order for 100 
aircraft and another 50 options in January 2002, close to the bottom of the last aviation recession.
It was the biggest order Boeing had ever received for its 737 jets, and Ryanair secured one of the largest discounts 
ever agreed by the US aircraft maker, which was desperate at the time for new orders.
Both Boeing and Airbus have said they expect new orders to plunge this year to roughly a quarter of the peak 
combined industry level of more than 2,800 new orders won in 2007.
Ryanair currently has a single-type fleet of 181 Boeing 737-800s.
This is due to rise to 292 by March 2012 based on its existing firm orders. It recently exercised options for 13 more 
jets for delivery in 2011 and has only 10 more options remaining.
It is halfway through a plan to double its fleet and passenger numbers between 2007 and 2012.
Passenger volumes are planned to grow from 43m in the year to March 2007 to 87m in the year to March 2012, 
when it will have become the biggest short-haul carrier in Europe ahead of both Air France-KLM and Lufthansa.
The potential Ryanair order will trigger a fierce contest between Boeing and Airbus. Mr Cawley said the group 
would be happy to move to a mixed Airbus/Boeing fleet given its size.
"We see no cost handicaps that cannot be overcome," he said.
Ryanair dangles order for 400 jets
"We would only order Airbus if it made a big difference to our cost base."
In the last downturn EasyJet, won big price concessions from Airbus to switch from a previously all-Boeing fleet, 
when it placed its biggest order a year after Ryanair. It is believed to have won discounts of around 50 per cent off 
the list price.
But the strategies of Ryanair and EasyJet are diverging sharply in the current recession.
EasyJet, the leading UK low-cost airline, is seeking to slow its growth sharply and has already begun to make use 
of advantageous clauses in its Airbus contract to defer half of its future deliveries by up to two years.
It is under heavy pressure, in particular from its founder and leading shareholder Sir Stelios HajiIoannou, to 
conserve cash and restrict growth.
Ryanair has reduced capacity expansion during the current winter season, but it is still seeking to maintain a 
strategy of high growth by cutting fares sharply to capture market share, as other carriers retrench.
Mr Cawley said Ryanair fares were expected to be 20 per cent lower in the current quarter compared to a year ago, 
and he forecast a fall of about 10 per cent in the coming financial year to the end of March 2010 as it tries to 
stimulate demand through lower fares.
The airline has already established 31 operating bases in Europe.
Mr Cawley said the group was expecting continuing strong growth in continental Europe in coming years in 
particular in Italy, Spain and Scandinavia, where local airlines were forced to consolidate and retrench.

Ryanair today said that within the next 18 months to two years it will place an order for 300 to 400 aircraft, due for 
delivery between 2012 and 2017.
Michael Cawley, deputy chief executive officer, said, the low-budget airline is currently in talks with both Airbus and 
Boeing Co. (BA) regarding potential new orders, which will eventually help see the airline carry 200 million 
passengers every year.
Cawley said the new orders would be balanced by selling some of the older aircraft -some 10pc to 20pc on a net 
basis.
There were no obstacles to running two fleets, "no cost handicaps," he added. Ryanair currently expects to grow 
passengers to 87 million by 2012.

European markets dropped sharply Monday, with financial and energy stocks leading the way down, as investors 
prepared for another week of poor earnings reports and gloomy economic data.
After Asian markets closed mostly lower, there was little appetite to buy in Europe, where faith in a rapid turnaround 
in the economy has been fading.
Britain's FTSE 100 fell 2.4 percent at 4,051.65, while the German DAX dropped 2.7 percent at 4,223.17. France's 
CAC 40 shed 3.0 percent at 2,883.62.
In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 3.1 percent to 12,861.49 and Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average dropped 1.5 
percent to 7,873.98.
Adding to the gloom, the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index posted record percentage 
drops for January 8.8 percent and 8.6 percent. As the month's performance typically sets the tone for the rest of the 
year, some market watchers took it as a bad omen.
"The spotlight is on the economy and earnings and doubts about when the recovery in the U.S. will materialize," 
said Song Seng Wun, head of research at CIMB-GK in Singapore. "We are likely to continue experiencing bouts of 
optimism alternated with periods of uncertainty. Tomorrow the markets could be racing ahead."
In Europe, budget airline Ryanair PLC said it had swung to a loss of €118.8 million ($151.3 million) in its third 
quarter compared with a €47.2 million profit a year earlier. However, the company said it would make a profit for the 
full year as customers opt for cheaper travel.
Bank shares were hit particularly hard Monday, with Barclays PLC down almost 10 percent in London, giving up 
some of the sharp gains made last week. BNP Paribas fell as much as 14 percent after its acquisition of some parts 
of troubled lender Fortis was revised Friday.
Energy stocks were also lower as crude prices continued to drop below $41 a barrel on Monday on expectations 
that demand for oil will languish as countries struggle with recession.
World markets fall on bleak earnings outlook
Beyond corporate news, markets are expected to continue focusing on government efforts to help banks. The 
Federal Reserve is prepared to buy Treasuries to help the economy, talks continue on a so-called 'bad bank' to 
absorb toxic assets from financial firms, while the Bank of England is from today cleared to buy 'high quality' assets 
from banks to provide liquidity and boost lending.
But analysts say the results of bailouts and rescue packages have not been wholly successful in keeping banks 
safe from swelling losses and write-downs.
"Such rescue efforts so far have failed to stem financial sector problems. Investors have continued to shift their 
money to safe havens such as government bonds and gold," said Christine Li, analyst at Moody's Economy.com in 
London.
"Bankers fear that as the recession deepens, the risk-weighting of the assets they hold is likely to grow, eroding 
their capital reserves as they are measured by regulators."
Li said the problem with the U.S. plan to create a 'bad bank' to store the toxic assets is how to value those assets if 
the price is too high, the taxpayer will be burdened, and if it is too low, it will not help banks improve their balance 
sheets and recover.
Looking at the week ahead, a slew of interest rate cuts are due in Britain, Norway, Australia, and the Czech 
Republic, although that has not been enough to boost sentiment. On Thursday all eyes will be on the European 
Central Bank, which has already signaled it would leave rates unchanged despite the economic downturn.
In Asia, South Korea's Kospi fell 1.3 percent at 1,146.95. Australia's main index fell 1.2 percent and markets in 
Singapore, Thailand and India fell 2 percent or more.
Mainland China's market, reopening after the weeklong Lunar New Years holiday, rose amid a report the 
government is considering new steps to boost growth. The Shanghai Composite index gained 1.1 percent to 
2,011.68.
The mixed sentiment was expected carry over to Wall Street, where Dow futures were down 135 points at 7,820 
and S&P 500 futures were off 15.50 at 807 after the indexes had fallen 1.8 percent and 2.3 percent on Friday.
Oil prices slipped below $41 a barrel Monday in Asia as investors weighed the threat of an oil worker strike in the 
U.S. against the prospect of more bad economic news this week. Light, sweet crude for March delivery fell $1.27 to 
$40.41 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The euro fell to $1.2744 from $1.2811 late Friday. The dollar was trading at 89.03 yen, down from 89.95.

Body
European budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a quarterly loss of €118.8 million ($151.3 
million) but forecast a speedy return to profit this year, citing cheaper fuel and a low-fares marketing strategy that 
can thrive in a recession.
The loss in the October-December quarter, the company's fiscal third, compared to a €47.2 million profit for the 
same quarter of 2007. O'Leary said the fall into the red was "almost entirely due" to a 72 percent spike in fuel costs 
that had now fully reversed itself amid falling oil prices.
Ryanair continued to cut average staff costs and grow its business in the traditionally slow quarter, as sales rose 6 
percent to €604.5 million and passenger volumes rose 13 percent to 14 million.
O'Leary said Ryanair had already signed advance contracts for three-quarters of its April-September fuel needs that 
reflect the drop of oil from highs of $147 a barrel to today's levels nearer $40. He said Ryanair likely would save 
about €500 million from its annual fuel bill if oil prices don't take off again.
O'Leary said he expected Ryanair to record a net profit of €50 million to €80 million for the full fiscal year ending in 
March, raising his previous forecasts of a break-even year or small loss.
"The general economic environment remains extremely difficult, as the recession saps consumer confidence, but 
this is proving to be good for Ryanair's traffic growth," O'Leary said in a statement.
"The longer and deeper this recession, the better it will be for the lowest-cost producers in every sector. ... We are 
poised for substantial traffic and profit growth in the coming year as the recession forces millions of passengers to 
focus on price," O'Leary said.
Investors embraced the raised outlook and Ryanair shares rose 7 percent to close at €3.07 ($3.96) on the Irish 
Stock Exchange.
Ryanair raises '09 outlook on lower fuel costs
O'Leary said Ryanair plans to introduce pay-to-use cell phones on 20 Dublin-based aircraft by the end of February, 
and on about 20 more aircraft by the end of the summer. He said the cell-phone service initially promised in 2007 
eventually would become "a strong source" of extra revenues.
O'Leary also poured cold water on the idea that Ryanair would launch a third takeover bid for its main Irish rival, Aer 
Lingus.
Ryanair already owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus stock and has twice appealed to other shareholders to sell out since 
the previously state-owned airline became publicly listed in 2006. O'Leary ditched his most recent attempt last 
month after the Irish government No. 2 shareholder with a 25 percent stake rejected Ryanair's sales pitch, citing the 
need to protect competition.
O'Leary said it was "doubtful that Ryanair will waste any further management time or resources making another 
offer for Aer Lingus, as its scale and losses will continue to render it increasingly irrelevant in Europe's airline 
landscape."
Ryanair has taken heavy paper losses on its accrual of Aer Lingus stock, which fell 1 percent to €1.00 ($1.29).

Ryanair has plunged to a massive loss of 128.68m euro before tax for the last three moths of 2008, reversing a 
profit of 50.48m euro in the same period a year earlier.
However, the low cost carrier has raised profit expectations for its full year, thanks to recent plunging fuel costs.
The carrier now expects to report an annual profit of between 50 and 80m euro before exceptionals, having 
previously forecast that it would only break even.
Ryanair was battered in the final months of last year by the oil price bubble, which saw its fuel costs soar by 71pc 
during the quarter. However, oil prices have since collapsed as a result of the global economic downturn. This 
morning's results show an adjusted loss after tax of 101.5m euro for the quarter, reversing a profit of 35m euro a 
year earlier. Passenger numbers were up 13pc to 14m from the comparable previous period, and revenue was 
ahead by 6pc to 604.5m euro. Average fares fell by 9pc to 34 euro, while fuel costs were up by 71pc to 328m Chief 
executive Michael O'Leary said this morning that the loss was "disappointing but in line with expectations". He said: 
"The general economic environment remains extremely difficult, as the recession saps consumer confidence, but 
this is proving to be good for Ryanair's traffic growth, as more and more passengers switch to Ryanair's lowest fare 
lowest cost model. "Many of our competitors have in recent months reported short-haul traffic falls, while Ryanair 
continues to grow. We will continue to lower fares to maintain our traffic growth and high load factors. "Thanks to 
lower oil costs and continuing reductions in non oil operating costs, we expect our Q4 loss will be smaller than 
previously anticipated, so we are upgrading our full year 2008/09 guidance from break even to a net profit after tax 
in a range of 50 - 80m euro before exceptionals. "We won't be in a position to give earnings guidance for next year, 
until the fare environment becomes somewhat clearer. At this time we expect fares to fall next year by over 10pc, 
although if the recession deepens, it could be worse than this. "However the 38pc reduction in oil prices which our 
fuel hedging has secured will ensure that Ryanair returns to substantial profitability next year, when many of our

competitors will be reporting losses. "It is doubtful that Ryanair will waste any further management time or 
resources making another offer for Aer Lingus, as its scale and losses will continue to render it increasingly 
irrelevant in Europe's airline landscape." He also hit out at the management of Dublin Airport whose "traffic is now 
in freefall, down 9pc in December". "This exposes the damage being done to Irish tourism and the wider economy 
by this high cost, inefficient, government owned airport monopoly," he said. "We call again for the Government to 
allow a competing terminal to be developed at Dublin Airport. "Ryanair would be willing to build and pay for such a 
facility which will relieve passengers from the high costs, long walks and even longer queues which are a feature of 
the third rate, third world services provided by Dublin Airport. "We expect our onboard mobile telephony service to 
become operational at the end of February on 20 Dublin based aircraft, and this trial, which will last for 6 months 
should be extended to some 40 aircraft by the end of the summer."

the index closed up 12.34 points at 2,323.73.
The ISEQ fell for a fifth successive month in January, shedding a further 1.4pc and bringing the 12-month 
performance to minus 65.3pc. The ISE general index gained 1.3pc, but this was largely due to Elan jumping 34.5pc. 
Excluding Elan, the general index would have returned a loss of 1.1pc for the month.
The ISE financials index fell 23.4pc and is now 97.6pc off the peak reached less than two years ago. Media reports 
now suggest that the Irish government is close to finalising a bank re-capitalisation plan, involving a E7bn to E8bn 
capital injection into AIB and Bank of Ireland and the establishment of an insurance scheme to underwrite the banks 
against potential losses on loans. The speculated capital injection is ahead of the government's earlier proposals to 
invest E2bn in preference shares apiece, with a commitment to support a further E1bn Tier 1 issuance each, 
although the government had recently confirmed the availability of up to E10bn for the purpose. Reports suggest 
the insurance scheme will be directed primarily at development lending. The banks will reportedly take some write-
down on the loans. Shares in AIB rose by 9c to E1.31, Bank of Ireland was down 2c at E0.63 and Irish Life and 
Permanent declined by 10c to E1.55. Ryanair has plunged to a massive loss of E128.68m before tax for the last 
three moths of 2008, reversing a profit of E50.48m in the same period a year earlier. However, the low cost carrier 
has raised profit expectations for its full year, thanks to recent plunging fuel costs. The carrier now expects to report 
an annual profit of between E50m and E80m before exceptionals, having previously forecast that it would only

to E1.15 after it posted pre-tax profits that fell by 87pc to E1.52m for the half year to December. Nearly half of the 
fall was accounted for by a E4.5m goodwill impairment charge. Profits before tax and impairment came in at

E6.02m, down 48pc on the previous year. Davy said that the first half was considerably more challenging than the 
six months to June 2008, with sequential NFI down 26pc on the permanent side. Temporary recruitment fared 
relatively better, down just 10pc sequentially in H1. Temporary and permanent accounted for 60pc and 40pc 
respectively for the period, reflecting the anticipated resilience of the temporary channel against a deteriorating 
economic backdrop. Among the small caps, shares in Dragon Oil fell by 9c to E1.68. Its shares are down 72pc from 
its mid-summer peak, while Cairn Energy is down circa 50pc from its similarly-timed record high. Dragon's sharper 
drop is surprising, said Davy analyst, Caren Crowley. "By and large, both Dragon and Cairn Energy can be 
considered plays on the oil price. Dragon Oil is highly geared to the prevailing oil price through the development of 
its substantial Turkmeni fields (644m gross barrels), while Cairn Energy's sensitivity to the oil price comes from the 
development of oil fields in Rajasthan, India (685m gross barrels)."

drop is surprising, said Davy analyst, Caren Crowley. "By and large, both Dragon and Cairn Energy can be 
considered plays on the oil price. Dragon Oil is highly geared to the prevailing oil price through the development of 
its substantial Turkmeni fields (644m gross barrels), while Cairn Energy's sensitivity to the oil price comes from the

(RTTNews) - US stocks were poised to kick off the new month in characteristically dismal fashion Monday morning 
in New York, as fears of a deep, prolonged recession continued to weigh on investor sentiment.
As of 6:15 am ET, the Dow Futures were down 134 points, the NASDAQ Futures were down 23 points, and the 
S&amp;P Futures were down 15 points.
The Dow and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst January ever -- a bad omen for stocks in what is shaping up to be 
a tumultuous 209.
On Friday, the Dow slipped 148.15 points or 1.8 percent at 8,000.86, the NASDAQ fell 31.42 points or 2.1 percent 
to 1,476.42 and the S&amp;P 500 closed down 19.26 points or 2.3 percent at 825.88.
The Dow fell 8.8 percent for the month, while the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 posted monthly losses of 6.2 
percent and 8.6 percent, respectively.
After a series of disappointing economic reports rattled Wall Street last week, on Monday the markets will digest a 
reading on December personal income and spending, followed by data on the nation&apos;s manufacturing activity. 
Construction spending figures are also due out this morning.
The pivotal January employment report is due for release on Friday.
SanDisk (SNDK), Humana (HUM), Merck (MRK), Motorola (MOT), Dow Chemical (DOW), and Disney (DIS) are 
among the companies due to report their quarterly results this week.
In earnings news Monday, low-cost airline operator Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Monday reported a loss 
for the third quarter, hurt by higher fuel costs. The company also updated its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2009 outlook.
Meanwhile, global Mining giant Rio Tinto (RTP) confirmed recent media speculation on its talks with existing 
shareholder Chinese aluminum group Chinalco, on it taking minority stake in some of Rio&apos;s businesses and 
investing in convertible instruments.
Asian stocks lost ground on Monday. The Hang Seng of Hong Kong lost 3.1 percent, while Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei 
dropped 1.5 percent.
Wall Street Set To Kick Off February On A Downbeat Note
In European intraday dealing, the FTSE of the UK lost 2.4 percent, the DAX of German lost 2.8 percent, and the 
CAC of France fell 3.1 percent.

Body
(RTTNews) - Monday, Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported third-quarter loss of 118.76 million euros or 
8.06 euro cents per share, compared to profit of 47.18 million euros or 3.13 euro cents per share in the previous 
year.
Excluding exceptional items, adjusted loss was 101.5 million euros or 6.88 euro cents per basic share, compared to 
profit of 35 million euros or 2.35 euro cents per basic share last year.
The company noted that the loss was disappointing, but in line with expectations, and was almost entirely due to a 
136 million euros increase in fuel costs.
Total operating revenues grew 6% to 604.54 million euros from 569.41 million euros a year ago, driven by 13% 
growth in traffic to 14 million, as more consumers switch to Ryanair's low fares from high fare competitors.
Looking ahead, the company now expects fourth quarter loss to be smaller than previously anticipated, and 
upgraded full year 2008/09 guidance to a net profit in a range of 50 million euros to 80 million euros, before 
exceptionals, from break even forecast.
However, the 38% reduction in oil prices which the company's fuel hedging has secured will ensure that Ryanair 
returns to substantial profitability in fiscal 2010, when many of its competitors will be reporting losses, the company 
said.

The airline's third-quarter loss attributable to equity holders of parent was 118.76 million euros, or 8.06 euro cents 
per share, compared with a profit of 47.18 million euros, or 3.13 euro cents per share, in the previous year. The 
company said the loss was disappointing, but in line with expectations.
Excluding exceptional items, Ryanair's adjusted loss was 101.47 million euros, or 6.88 euro cents per basic share, 
versus a profit of 35.05 million euros, or 2.35 euro cents per basic share, last year. The company's pre-tax loss 
reached 128.68 million euros, compared with a pre-tax profit of 50.48 million euros in the prior-year quarter.
Airline's quarterly operating revenues grew 6% to 604.54 million euros from 569.41 million euros a year ago. 
Ancillary revenues were up 19% to 131.83 million euros, accounting for 22% of the total revenues.
The company's traffic rose 13% in the quarter to 14 million, as more consumers switched to low fares from high fare 
competitors. However, average fares were down by 9% in the quarter to 34 euros.
Fuel costs climbed 71% in the quarter to 328 million euros and accounted for 47% of the company's total operating 
costs. Excluding fuel, other operating costs dropped 3% on a per passenger basis due to improved unit cost 
performances on staff costs, airport and handling costs, and depreciation.
Ryanair announced withdrawing the Aer Lingus offer immediately, after the Irish Government on January 22 
rejected its cash offer of 748 million euros for 25% stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair also believes Aer Lingus will report 
substantial losses in 2008 and again in 2009.
"Whilst we regret that the Government's decision means that we can not now deliver on our promises to reduce Aer 
Lingus's short-haul fares, double its short-haul fleet and create 1,000 new jobs, this decision clears the way for 
Ryanair to continue to focus on our own growth and expansion, reducing our costs and returning to substantial 
profitability over the coming year."
"It is doubtful that Ryanair will waste any further management time or resources making another offer for Aer 
Lingus, as its scale and losses will continue to render it increasingly irrelevant in Europe's airline landscape," said 
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
Ryanair swings to loss in Q3; updates Q4, FY09 view - update
For nine months, the airline posted a loss attributable to equity holders of parent of 23.44 million euros, or 1.59 euro 
cents per share, compared with a profit of 454.77 million euros, or 29.65 euro cents per share, a year earlier. Total 
operating revenues rose to 2.42 billion euros from 2.12 billion euros in the previous year.
Looking ahead, the company now expects that its fourth-quarter loss will be narrower than previously expected, 
helped by lower oil costs and continuing reductions in non oil operating costs. The company also expects fourth-
quarter average fares to fall by 20% at the upper end of its previously guided range.
For fiscal 2009, the company currently anticipates an after tax net profit in the range of 50 million euros - 80 million 
euros before exceptional items compared with its prior forecast of breakeven.
"We won't be in a position to give earnings guidance for next year, until the fare environment becomes somewhat 
clearer. At this time we expect fares to fall next year by over 10%, although if the recession deepens, it could be 
worse than this. However the 38% reduction in oil prices which our fuel hedging has secured will ensure that 
Ryanair returns to substantial profitability next year, when many of our competitors will be reporting losses," O'Leary 
noted.
Further, the company expects its onboard mobile telephony service to become operational at the end of February 
on twenty Dublin-based aircraft. The trial, which will last for 6 months, will be extended to some 40 aircraft by the 
end of the summer. Although the company sees small initial revenues, the in-flight communication is expected to be 
a strong source of ancillary revenue growth in future years.
RYAAY closed Friday's trading at $24.02, down $1.41, on a volume of 1.17 million shares.
RYA.L is trading at 3.01 pence on the LSE, up 0.15 pence, on a volume of 2.97 million shares.

(RTTNews) - Following a poor performance on Friday, stocks are likely to show additional weakness on Monday as 
investors respond to a report on personal income and spending and await the release of the ISM Manufacturing 
Index for January.
Furthermore, quarterly results from companies like Humana (HUM), Mattel (MAT), and Rockwell (ROK) are also 
likely to influence trading throughout the day.
On the economic front, the Commerce Department said that personal income fell by 0.2 percent in December 
following a revised 0.4 percent decrease in November. Economists had been expecting income to fall 0.4 percent 
compared to the 0.2 percent decrease originally reported for the previous month.
The report also showed that personal spending fell by 1.0 percent in December after falling by a revised 0.8 percent 
in the previous month. The decrease was slightly steeper than the 0.9 percent drop expected by economists.
The results of the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey for the month of January are due out at 
10 am ET. Economists expect the index of activity in the sector to edge down to a reading of 32 for January from a 
reading of 32.4 in December.
Additionally, the Commerce Department's construction spending report to be released at 10 am ET is expected to 
show a 0.9 percent decline in spending for December. Construction spending fell 0.6 percent in November, led by a 
4.1 percent decline in residential construction spending.
In corporate news, Humana Inc. reported fourth-quarter net income that fell year-over-year and missed 
expectations, although its revenue figure beat expectations.
Looking ahead, the company expects full fiscal 2009 earnings per share to come in line with analysts' expectations.
Mattel Inc. also posted quarterly results earlier in the day but failed to miss expectations for both its earnings per 
share figure and its revenue figure. Furthermore, the company's full-year 2008 earnings also fell short of 
expectations.
Similarly, Rockwell Automation also posted weaker-than-expected quarterly results and reduced its outlook for the 
full-year 2009.
Stocks Likely To See Further Downside In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary
Low-cost airline operator Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported a loss for the third quarter, hurt by higher 
fuel costs. The company also updated its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2009 outlook.
Meanwhile, global Mining giant Rio Tinto (RTP) confirmed recent media speculation on its talks with existing 
shareholder Chinese aluminum group Chinalco on taking a minority stake in some of Rio's businesses and 
investing in convertible instruments.
After seeing some initial strength, stocks moved sharply lower over the course of the trading day on Friday. The 
major averages all pulled back firmly into negative territory, extending the downward move seen over the course of 
the previous session.
With the losses on Friday, the major averages posted modest losses for the week, although they showed notable 
declines for the month of January. The Dow fell 8.8 percent for the month, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 
posted monthly losses of 6.2 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively.
Crude oil futures are trading down $0.84 at $40.84 a barrel after seeing some strength earlier in the session. The 
price of oil fell $4.79 or 10.3 percent to $41.68 a barrel in the week ended January 30th, as reports of rising oil 
inventories led to selling.
The price of gold is also moving lower, slipping $15.70 to $911.60 an ounce. In the previous week, the precious 
metal rose $29.60 or 3.30% to $927.30 an ounce.
On the currency front, the U.S. dollar advanced against the yen and the euro last week. The dollar rose 1.3 percent 
against the yen to 89.92 yen and 1.21 percent against the euro to $1.2812. Currently, the dollar is trading at 89.341 
yen and is worth $1.2771 versus a euro.
In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region ended mostly lower Monday, tracking the losses 
on Wall Street on Friday. The weakness was also due to a slew of dismal earnings and forecasts from the 
companies in the region.
The major European markets are also receding, with the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index 
declining 3 percent and 2.5 percent respectively, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is moving down 2.4 percent.

Ryanair makes £91m loss as fuel costs bite
Ryanair makes £91m loss as fuel costs bite

Ryanair revealed the impact of soaring petrol costs on the airline industry after announcing it had made a loss in the 
last three months of 2008.
The largest low fare airline in Europe said it had made a loss of 102 million (£91 million) in the third quarter to end 
of December, down significantly from a profit of 35 million last year.
However, it offset this by upgrading profit forecasts for the full year as its move not to hedge its fourth quarter oil 
costs paid off.
The group's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, blamed the third quarter loss almost entirely on rising fuel costs, 
which increased by 136 million or 71% year on year, to 328 million.
'Our Q3 loss of 102 million was disappointing, but in line with expectations, and was almost entirely due to a 136 
million increase in fuel costs,' he said.
As well as higher fuel costs the company has also had to cut its average fare price by 9%, impacting margins.
However, it has grown its traffic by 14 million passengers, which in turn boosted revenues which grew by 6% to 
604.5 million.
Ryanair was also upbeat looking ahead, noting it had taken advantage of recent falls in the cost of jet fuel to hedge 
at a lower level for the fourth quarter.
As a result it said it was upgrading its fourth quarter estimates.
'Thanks to lower oil costs and continuing reductions in non oil operating costs, we expect the Q4 loss will be smaller 
than previously anticipated,' the company said.
'We are upgrading our full year 2008/09 guidance from break even to a net profit after tax in a range of 50 - 80 
million.'

Ryanair has reported a third-quarter loss of (EURO)102 million ($133 million) because of high fuel costs. The airline 
boldly chose not to hedge its fuel during the summer, when oil prices hit $147 per barrel.
While revenues and traffic rose in the last three months of 2008 by 6% and 13%, respectively, the (EURO)136 
million increase in fuel costs crippled the profit-making ability of the airline.
The general economic environment remains extremely difficult, as the recession saps consumer confidence, but 
this is proving to be good for Ryanair's traffic growth, as more and more passengers switch to Ryanair's lowest fare, 
lowest cost model," says Michael O'Leary, CEO at the carrier. "Many of our competitors have in recent months 
reported short-haul traffic falls, while Ryanair continues to grow," he adds.
The company intends continuing to lower fares in order to remain competitive, expecting other low-cost carriers to 
close or consolidate.
With (EURO)1.8 billion in cash, the airline is expecting a return to profitability in 2009 and 2010. O'Leary says that 
its floating cash deposits will provide a no-cost hedge to its floating debt. The company also plans to lock in 
financing for 2009 deliveries at historically low fixed interest rates. Ryanair will also benefit from hedging its 
exchange rate, because erratic fluctuations have made aircraft more expensive and financing more difficult.
Though the airline is still forecasting a loss for the fourth quarter, it is revising its prediction from breakeven for the 
full financial year to a modest profit, because of lower fuel costs. Margins will suffer with recessionary pressures 
and continued aggressive fare reductions.

Ryanair has closed a Japanese operating lease (JOL) financing for two 737-800s for January delivery. Calyon and 
SMBC are joint debt arrangers and Calyon is acting as agent for the two aircraft. Yamasa is equity arranger. 
 The aircraft are part of a JOL debt package for six 737-800s for which BNP Paribas,Calyon, ING and SMBC have 
been mandated as joint debt arrangers. 
 Chilean airline LAN closed an export credit loan for three A319 aircraft in January. 
 The deal is valued at between $100 million and $150 million. BNP Paribas arranged the deal. 
BNP Paribas has received credit committee approval for another export credit financing for an Airbus aircraft to be 
delivered to a North American carrier. The bank is also considering doing commercial loans in the next few months. 
Guggenheim Aviation Investment Fund II has closed two prepayment delivery facilities for a total of $410 million. 
Calyon was lead arranger and is also facility agent. 
 One facility will be used to fund Boeing aircraft comprising five 777LRFs, one 777-300ER and four 747-8s due for 
delivery between late 2009 and 2011. The other facility is for six A330-200Fs, scheduled for delivery between 2010

Body
No-frills airline, Ryanair, has called on the Dublin Airport Authority to cut airport charges by 30pc to help reverse the 
slump in traffic volumes.
"These unjustified price increases from carparks to check-in desks, to the treble charging for kiosks have created a 
wave of route closures and airline departures from high cost Dublin Airport, as competitor airports across the UK 
and Europe lower their charges, leaving Dublin Airport uncompetitive and out of touch," a Ryanair statement said.
Dublin Airport's traffic declined by 9pc in December.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Ryanair and other airlines at Dublin have long complained 
about the high cost, out of touch, "couldn't care less" attitude of the Government owned DAA monopoly. The traffic 
collapse at Dublin Airport in recent months shows the damage the DAA monopoly is doing to Irish tourism and the 
Irish economy. At a time when Ryanair is growing traffic by 14pc, at lower cost airports all over Europe, the 9pc fall 
in Dublin's traffic in December can only be explained by the high costs and third rate facilities passengers are 
subjected to by the DAA monopoly." "The DAA which has increased charges by 30pc over the past three years - 
more than twice the rate of inflation - should now reverse these charges by reducing carparking, airport check-in 
fees and passenger fees by 30pc, and eliminating the double and treble charging for things like kiosks in terminals 
which are already fully paid for by the airlines through high passenger charges. The Government can also play its 
part by scrapping the insane E10 travel tax which is to be levied on passengers next April."

The European Commission ruled that the move constituted state aid to Air France.
The commission had looked into a complaint from Ryanair that more than 1bn euro in aid was received by Air 
France through such discounts.
The low cost airline's Jim Callaghan said the decision confirmed that flag carriers throughout Europe have been, 
and are, in receipt of billions of euro in state aid.
He said this had been going on while the Commission was wasting time pursuing tiny regional and secondary 
airports, like Charleroi, for, what the Courts have now found, were commercial arms-length deals.

Body
Ryanair has abandoned its bid to acquire rival airline Aer Lingus because of the Irish government's refusal to sell its 
stake.
Ryanair says in a brief statement Wednesday that it cannot acquire Ireland's other major airline unless the 
government hands over its 25 percent share. Last week the government ruled out doing a deal with Ryanair, citing 
the need to preserve competition in air services.
Ryanair had until Friday to decide whether to raise its offer, unveiled last month, of €1.40 ($1.85) per Aer Lingus 
share. Ryanair already owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus, but virtually no other shareholders accepted the offer.
Ryanair shares rose on the news on the Irish Stock Exchange, while Aer Lingus fell.

Ryanair said in a statement to the stock exchange today, that, following the Government's decision last week not to 
accept its offer of E1.40 per share, it acknowledges that its offer can not now be successful.
"Accordingly the offer is now withdrawn," the brief statement concludes.
Transport Minister Noel Dempsey last week said the Government believed the Ryanair offer greatly undervalued 
Aer Lingus and would have a significant negative impact on competition in the market. "Because we live on an 
island, Irish consumers depend very heavily on air transport. A monopoly in this area would not be in the best 
interests of Irish consumers," Minister Dempsey said.

Ryanair has pledged to fight on in its battle against 'screenscrapers' despite losing a court case in Spain.
The airline said it would appeal last week's ruling in favour of Atrapalo, a company whose own website provides 
price comparisons and allows users to buy purchase flights on multiple airlines including Ryanair.
Ryanair already holds a court order over German website Vtours which conducts similar practices. Ryanair has 
been cancelling passenger bookings made through these sites and this action has led to counter threats of legal 
proceedings being undertaken by eDreams, a Spanish firm offering similar services to Atrapalo.
Ryanair argues that these websites overcharge customers, sometimes by up to 500 percent. Furthermore the 
airline maintains that the proprietors are acting illegally and the sites are akin to ticket touts. "We have provided the 
courts with documentary evidence of this unauthorised, ticket-tout scam being perpetrated on consumers by these 
screenscraper websites," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair. "We do not believe that a court should 
put the interests of these unauthorised sites ahead of the interests of the consumers who have been exposed to 
hidden mark ups and over-charged by these screenscraper/ticket-tout websites."

Looking to banish the birds
New York A320 ditching highlights urgency of coming up with new methods to keep avian activity in check at 
airports 
Assuming the US Airways Airbus A320 ditched in New York's Hudson river two weeks ago proves to have been 
brought down by Canada geese, the incident will still be only the most serious of numerous birdstrikes in the past 
year.
But regardless of the astoundingly fortunate outcome, a renewed industry focus on tackling what has proved to be 
an enduring challenge for civil aviation seems certain.
It is a tribute to sound regulatory action and manufacturers' engineering expertise that modern engines have proved 
to be so resilient when struck by birds. Despite that, the hazard generates huge costs even when aircraft survive, 
and there have been sufficient close calls to leave little doubt that a catastrophe is a reasonably likely turn of 
events.
Just two months earlier a Ryanair Boeing 737-800, also CFM56-powered, barely made it to a landing that collapsed 
the landing gear when both engines lost virtually all power after ingesting a number of starlings from a flock that 
engulfed it at about 200ft (60m) above ground on short finals to Rome Ciampino.
A month earlier a Cyprus Airways Airbus A330 flew from Larnaca, Cyprus to London despite having ingested birds 
into both engines on departure.

A recent report from the French government and civil aviation authority DGAC noted that 700 birdstrikes occur in 
the country each year, including 20% considered "significant" in terms of damage, cost or safety. It records a 
INTRODUCTION:
Boeing 767 incident in 2007 in which the ingestion of three herring gulls generated a e4 million ($5 million) repair 
bill.
Major UK airport operator BAA has adopted a strategy of concentrating its bird-control effort on those species that 
are most prevalent and/or most likely to cause the worst damage. It is pleased with the results, which have seen 
such incidents at its seven locations fall steadily from 108 in 2004 to 71 in 2007, but still totalled 44 by the end of 
August last year.
John Allan, head of the birdstrike avoidance team at the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
Central Science Laboratory (CSL) and chairman of the International Birdstrike Committee (IBSC), says BAA's 
flagship Heathrow operation is a global industry leader with fewer than 1 strike per 10,000 aircraft movements. 
"There are European airports with rates of more than 10 per 10,000 movements," he says.
UK CAA figures reveal a total civil birdstrike number for the nine months up to September 2008 as being more than 
1,200, although the advent of mandatory reporting in the UK in 2004 drove the number of recorded incidents up 
dramatically - many of them minor.
The US Federal Aviation Administration reported more than 33,000 civil birdstrikes between 1990 and 2000, and 
the figure now runs at 7-8,000 a year as reporting has been tightened up.
Airbus's analysis of in-service reports suggests that two out of three birdstrikes result in a delay of upwards of 
90min due to checks being carried out, plus repairs if required. The manufacturer says that incidents on take-off or 
climb-out result in a one-in-three likelihood that the flight will not continue to its planned destination.
But it adds that approach incidents, probably due to low power settings, are more benign, and in one recorded case 
at a maritime airport an Airbus A320 flew through a flock of birds without ingesting any but leaving 250 dead birds 
on the tarmac.
Much of the best practice in bird control is now widely accepted and implemented with local variations according to 
native species and habitat. Relatively long grass - 15-20cm (6-8in) in the UK - is the norm, covering of storm ponds 
and other standing water with wire grids or floating balls for smaller areas is common, and planning regulation to 
restrict the development of waste disposal and gravel digging near airports is in global use to varying degrees.
maritime radars
Technological solutions are less common, but the past couple of years have seen a growing interest in the use of 
high-resolution radar to track birds. The systems entering service are typically enhanced versions of commercially 
available maritime radars, mechanically scanned and either X-band or S-band, but with sophisticated signal 
processing added.
Dr Tim Nohara, president of Niagara, Ontario-based Accipiter Radar Technologies (ARTI), says the systems are 
able to resolve targets down to individual birds. He explains that the benefit of radar is that it gives all-weather, day 
and night surveillance of local bird activity in a way that human observers cannot achieve.
Additionally it provides real time and recorded historic data for subsequent analysis including location, height, speed 
and heading.
This is crucial as a "force multiplier" when implementing classic "habitat modification" techniques he says. "Avian 
radars allow you to measure the efficiency of these methods. The fact of the matter is that now they use humans 
periodically to sample it, but at night time there is virtually no data and it is very sparse by day."
Under a US FAA Center of Excellence for Airport Technology (CEAT) programme, ARTI has systems running at 
Seattle-Tacoma International and Chicago O'Hare, plus another at New York Kennedy, which is delivered but not 
yet operational.
INTRODUCTION:
"This is putting radars into candidate airports and really understanding what they give you and understanding their 
limitations. And that moves to the second part, which is to see how would controllers and wildlife experts and so on 
use this tool," says Nohara.
He notes that the US Airways accident has sparked interest in the possibility of using the radar data in real time to 
provide live avoiding information to controllers. Intriguingly, he says recent ARTI work designed to capture data on 
near-misses as well as the much rarer birdstrikes demonstrated that real-time data could be generated.
He cautiously suggests: "This is the most futuristic use - but you can imagine an advisory from an avian radar that 
there are some movements in such an area that might get into conflict with aircraft. The technology is available and 
could provide that kind of indicator, but more work needs to be done to see how effective that might be."
More realistically for now he sees the radars as being of enormous use to under-resourced airport wildlife staff. A 
biologist arriving for work could fast-forward through the night-time radar recording and watch where the birds have 
roosted.
And by collating historic data it would be much easier to identify local problem areas, such as standing water.
He foresees radar being used in Europe, where the use of safety management systems is more widespread, to give 
airport management an accurate measure of return on investment in bird-control programmes.
a single bird
Detect, of Panama City, Florida, which supplies the "Merlin ATC" radar system, relates an incident in which a single 
bird that hit an aircraft caused a runway at New York Kennedy to close for 6min on an otherwise free-flowing day, 
resulting in an immediate air traffic back-up.
"A radar-indicated hold of 30s for a bird to clear the runway may be more acceptable in terms of traffic management 
than a 6min delay when a strike has occurred, and tools such as Merlin ATC could provide much improved 
situational data to airport personnel to support sound decision-making," it says.
In Europe, Amsterdam Schiphol airport will shortly begin using the Robin Lite radar system developed by the 
Netherlands' TNO research and development organisation. Senior project manager Addy Borst says the system is 
already in use with the country's air force and has cut the service's birdstrike rate by a remarkable 50%, although 
the commercial priorities at civil airports may make similar gains difficult to achieve.
Robin Lite has the claimed capability to analyse wing-beat patterns of individual birds in a flock which, says Borst, 
gives an indication of size and hence species - potentially useful information.
He explains: "Some birds are not really an issue for birdstrike protection because they are smart enough to get 
away. Ravens, for example, learn quite fast. But gulls and pelicans are quite stupid birds. So birdstrike protection 
people would like to know what kind of birds to approach."
He also believes that there is the potential for air traffic controllers to use data in realtime, but suggests that that in 
turn raises a legal issue. He says: "Controllers could be informed when you see a swarm of birds approach and can 
see that their trajectory will take them into conflict with aircraft, and then you could halt take-offs for say 30s. But 
then if they decide to give take-off clearances instead then there is a liability issue."
It is not a theoretical point - airports have already paid out large sums to airlines in liability settlements following 
birdstrikes.
In the UK, CSL's Allan points to resource constraints as a key factor. He says: "In essence we know what needs to 
be done. We have enough knowledge about bird management and bird-scaring techniques to keep it under control. 
But some of this work is not cheap. Managing an airfield to make it unattractive to birds is very expensive and if you 
are one of the smaller airports this is an issue. Heathrow has two [bird control] vehicles out all day and it is do-able. 
The difficulties arise when you have to find a budget to do this work."
INTRODUCTION:
habitat management
The result, he says, is that many airports tend to focus on bird-scaring, which is successful in the short term, but 
undertake inadequate habitat-management work, which would yield better long-term results.
He is also unhappy with the degree of research being performed in the UK, noting that, through lack of data, "we 
really don't understand how to do bird control at night" despite probably having the technology to do it.
And he worries that the industry is failing to keep up with the evolving threat, notably by still using techniques aimed 
at controlling lapwings, formerly the prevalent species of concern in the UK, when pigeons, which require a different 
approach, are now by far the biggest threat.

EU probes Lufthansa Brussels Airlines deal

European Union regulators said Monday that they needed to carefully probe Lufthansa AG's bid for Brussels 
Airlines, to check if the tie-up would create a monopoly on some routes.
The regulators set a new deadline of June 10 to rule on the deal. The EU rarely blocks takeovers, but can demand 
the companies sell off units or change the way they do business in order to eliminate antitrust worries.
Lufthansa plans to spend €65 million ($85 million) on a 45 percent stake in the holding company that owns the 
Belgian carrier.
The deal gives the German airline the option to take over all of Brussels Airlines in 2011 for a price not exceeding 
€250 million ($325 million).
The European Commission said its initial review of the deal showed that the new company would become the only 
airline serving routes from Brussels to the German cities of Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich. It would also reduce 
competition on the Brussels to Berlin route.
Regulators saw other problems with routes from Brussels to the Swiss cities of Zurich and Geneva. They said 
Lufthansa had offered to make changes to the deal without giving details but they did not go far enough to "remove 
the serious doubts identified."
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes says she must make sure "consumers will continue to have a 
competitive choice of airline services both as regards fares and routes."
Most of Europe's airlines are former national flag carriers that run the majority of flights outside of their homeland. 
That makes combining with other airlines difficult because merging with a rival can make them a monopoly player.
The EU blocked Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus last year because the company would control most flights out of 
Dublin.
Lufthansa also plans to buy the Austrian government's 41.56 percent stake in the struggling Austrian Airlines.

Last year, it bought 80 percent control of BMI British Midland which gave it a much greater presence at London's 
Heathrow Airport. It was also reportedly interested in Scandinavian airline group SAS AB and bankrupt Italian 
carrier Alitalia.

Business gives EUR 16.7m to arts
Private investment in arts and culture totalled EUR 16.7 million last year, according to a survey by the Business to 
Arts organisation. The survey of 128 arts and cultural organisations found that 76 per cent of participant 
organisations received some level of private investment. Business represented the bulk of the investment through 
sponsorship, donations, patronage and foundation grants. There was a spread of investment from across business 
sectors, with consumer business, technology and the financial services sectors all well represented.
Aer Lingus rapped over ad
Aer Lingus has been ordered not to repeat an advertisement for 'free' flights following a complaint by Ryanair. The 
British regional press ad, created by VCCP Blue, stated: ''No aer fare. Just pay taxes and charges London to 
Dublin/Belfast/Cork."
Ryanair complained to the British Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the 'No aer fare' headline misleadingly 
implied that flights were free, even though customers had to pay non-optional charges. It also complained that the 
ad failed to include all non-optional taxes, duties and fees in the prices of the flights. Upholding the Ryanair 
complaint, the ASA said: ''We considered flights could not be advertised as 'free' if consumers had to pay non-
optional taxes and duties." It concluded that the ad was misleading.
Young Irish look to Australia
Tourism Australia's partnership with MySpace and Bebo's series, 'The Gap Year', resulted in more than 3 million 
online visitors last year. The country has reported a 50 per cent increase in the number of young Irish people 
planning on going to Australia on a working holiday visa.
The Inside Track
Figures released by the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship last week showed that the number of 
Irish people aged 18 to 30 planning working holiday visits increased to 12,790 in the second half of last year. The 
number for the equivalent period in 2007 was 8,417.
''With the current economic situation in Ireland, many young school leavers and graduates may be struggling to find 
work, and are looking for other opportunities. The working holiday visa gives them the chance to live and work in 
Australia for up to two years," said Rodney Harrex, Tourism Australia's general manager for Ireland.

The Aer Lingus impasse continues. The government's decision to reject Ryanair's latest takeover approach last 
week put a swift end to chief executive Michael O'Leary's ambitions to gain control of the former state carrier for the 
foreseeable future.
The manner in which Noel Dempsey, the Minister for Transport, shot down the approach suggests that O'Leary has 
painted himself and his smaller rival into an uncomfortable corner.
While the government was unhappy at the price of  1.40 per share on offer, Dempsey also said Ryanair had not 
done enough to ease its concerns over the competition implications of the deal.
Aer Lingus now looks set for a continuation of the uneasy three-way accommodation that has been in place since 
Ryanair first appeared on its share register.
Ryanair, the biggest shareholder with a 29 per cent interest, wants to take over the airline but looks increasingly 
incapable of doing so.
The government, the second largest shareholder, took the view in 2006 that it no longer wanted to own the airline 
but, in 2009, wants to use its 25 per cent stake to ensure that Ryanair does not end up in control.
The Aer Lingus board, meanwhile, remains opposed to a Ryanair takeover and favours remaining independent 
instead. But it will continue to be a strange form of independence.
With over half of the company tied up in two blocs, and a further 14 per cent held by an employee trust, only 31 per 
cent of Aer Lingus's shares are available for trading. This alone is a strong disincentive for institutional investors 
who might otherwise buy shares in the company.
Where next for O'Leary and Ryanair ?
Aer Lingus shares fell 15 per cent to  1.15 after Dempsey's intervention last week, as unaligned investors sold out 
in the knowledge that the takeover would not proceed and that the prospect of Ryanair upping its offer to get the 
deal over the line had evaporated.
Dermot Mannion, the chief executive of Aer Lingus, must now deliver for shareholders who accepted his argument 
that  1.40 per share undervalued the airline and that they would be better off rejecting the offer in the hope of better 
returns as an independent business. As the airline failed to deliver after the board rejected Ryanair's  2.80 per 
share offer in 2006,Mannion's task will be urgent.
Last week, however, Mannion moved quickly to consolidate Aer Lingus's independent status. He will add to Aer 
Lingus's long haul business with plans to exploit the Open Skies regime by operating a Washington Madrid service 
in partnership with United Airlines.
The move, if successful, could see Aer Lingus operate up to three routes between continental Europe and the US 
with United within two years and, potentially, set up a groundbreaking joint venture with the American carrier. Other 
positives for Mannion include new services linking London Gatwick with several European cities, reducing the 
airline's existing reliance on routes out of Ireland and the hope that the gamble of setting up abase in Belfast will 
payoff.
O'Leary, meanwhile, must reflect on the strategic cul-de sac he has driven into. Unable to take full control of Aer 
Lingus despite ploughing around  400 million into shares in the company, he has nonetheless pledged to retain 
Ryanair's shareholding for the long term. He has little choice. Any attempt to liquidate the Aer Lingus stake would 
force Ryanair to take further substantial losses on its investment and would be seen as an admission that his 
takeover adventures were an expensive mistake.
However, he may have more pressing concerns, as a severe recession looks set to grip Europe and dent consumer 
spending power at a time when Ryanair must make use of new aircraft coming on stream.
Convincing the government of the merits of the takeover may have been tough and ultimately unsuccessful. Filling 
his planes in the year ahead could be even tougher.

Section: FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - HOUSE & HOME; Pg. 2
Length: 728 words
Body
My prediction at the beginning of the year - that our client base would increasingly be from continental Europe - has 
proved prophetic. While in the second millennium London was the Krug and caviar capital of Europe in terms of 
property prices, it is now more like a mid-range pizzeria for anyone who wants to cash in their euros and consider 
buying.
I spent last weekend celebrating the soixante-neuf  (their combined ages) of my friends Emily and Harold, who own 
the best hotel on the Breton coast, the Grand Hôtel des Bains. It's a wonderful place with 30 rooms all decorated in 
a minimally chic New England manner, a spa, sea views and the most delicious food. It was the obvious venue in 
which to entertain 60 of their friends.
All of the guests hailed from Paris or London. The British party, which included me, suffered the indignity of 
travelling by Ryanair. While my fellow FT columnist Tyler Brûlé spends his inches discussing the finer points of first-
class travel, I'm reduced to reporting on the horrors of a budget airline (though I am still shameless when it comes 
to hitching lifts on Big Daddy's private jet). I vowed to never again fly Ryanair after a particularly hideous flight to 
Cork seven years ago but I relented last weekend for practical purposes. One of the many heinous things about the 
airline is the stealth taxes they add; you pay to check in, you pay for your bags . . . I thought I might be asked to 
hand over a couple of euros when I went to use the aircraft's lavatory. They play incessant digitalised music that 
would drive a two-year-old to dementia and the interiors of the planes are a visual assault on the senses.
And don't get me started on the Ryanair staff on the ground at Dinard airport - petty, belligerent and frankly 
inhuman. Some guests were prevented from boarding their return flight even though they were at the airport an 
hour before the plane took off and one had a connecting flight to catch to Shanghai.
But all this was thankfully neutralised by the pleasure of the weekend - champagne, oysters, spa treatments, 
lobster, Daphne du Maurier-esque walks along the inspiring Brittany coast-line, stylish Parisians, more champagne, 
black-tie dinners, superb company,  crêpes à l'exterieur  in the sunshine overlooking the sea, dancing, yet more 
champagne, sea bathing and the best hosts imaginable. I would gladly take another dozen more Ryanair flights to 
relive it all again.
Among the Parisians was a beautiful pair, a man and woman in their mid-20s, who remained shrouded in enigma 
as the British guests speculated whether they were lovers, siblings, best friends or all three. They are both actors 
and he had just played the cross-dressing lead in an Eric Rohmer film - so very French. They are moving to London 
When on the continent...
and the Thesp will be sure to find them a suitable flat to rent - somewhere perhaps in Covent Garden, close to their 
new agent and casting directors who will, inevitably, fall at their feet.
Surprisingly they were without ego and as I danced the night away in our newly formed ménage à trois , recreating 
Truffaut's Jules et Jim , it took me back to my own French dancing days at Les Bains Douche night club, where I 
spent many a night in my gap year. I wasn't so fond of the Parisians in those days but now I am a convert. They can 
be impossibly arrogant but they do have a certain style, a certain allure.
The other thing I observed is that the French all seem to smoke, while I'm the only British person I know who is still 
partial to the odd puff. Another French couple I met while sharing a cigarette under the stars (it's a great unifier, the 
smoking business) want to buy in London. Of course, they want to be in South Kensington or as they more correctly 
pronounced it " sud de Kensington ", since it's largely colonised by their compatriots. It appears Parisian prices 
have rocketed in the past three years and although they are coming down now, Paris is no longer the poor cousin to 
London.
So, as we creep into 2009, my client base is 80 per cent European and 20 per cent American, without any active 
British buyers for the moment. I expect that the developers who sold in 2007 will soon be ready to return to the 
market and snap up a bargain. But until then it will simply mean more European weekends away - for business as 
much as for pleasure.
Some details have been changed.

Ryanair has predicted a "sharp fall" in Aer Lingus shares over the coming days.
It says the fall will come as a result of the government's rejection yesterday of a bid for the company from the low-
cost carrier.
In a reaction to the government rejection, Ryanair says it believes the government's decision is a wrong one, as its 
cash offer greatly exceeded the intrinsic value of Aer Lingus.
The all cash offer of 1.40 per share valued Aer Lingus at 748m euro. Ryanair said it would abide by the 
government's decision, which meant that its offer would not be successful, since its 90pc acceptance condition 
could not be satisfied. 'We will respect and abide by the Government's decision,' Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said. 'We don't think it is in the best interests of Aer Lingus, which will be isolated as a small, peripheral, 
loss making airline, reduced to announcing so called 'partnerships' with other loss makers like United Airlines. 'It is 
strange, when the Irish government is looking for 2bn euro in cost savings, that it would reject an offer of 188m euro 
for its 25pc stake in Aer Lingus. 'It is also sad, when thousands of jobs are being lost in Ireland, that Ryanair's offer 
to create 1,000 new Irish jobs in Aer Lingus over the next five years has been rejected. 'We would like to thank the 
government and other Aer Lingus shareholders for the time and consideration they have given to our offer over the 
past seven weeks. "Ryanair will now focus all of our energies on continuing to successfully grow and develop 
Ireland's biggest airline and we will ensure that Ireland will still be home to one of Europe's big four airline groups 
(Ryanair, Air France, BA and Lufthansa).'

The Irish government yesterday said it would not support Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus, scuppering the low-cost 
airline's hostile approach to take over its smaller rival.
The government, which owns 25 per cent of Aer Lingus, said Ryanair's EUR1.40 a share all-cash offer, which 
valued the airline at EUR748m (£701m), "greatly undervalues Aer Lingus and a merger on the basis proposed 
would be likely to have a significant negative impact on competition in the market".
Noel Dempsey, transport minister, said: "Because we live on an island, Irish consumers depend heavily on air 
transport. A monopoly in this areas would not be in the best interests of Irish consumers.
"The offer by Ryanair did not include any proposed remedies for the virtual monopoly that would result if the offer 
was accepted."
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, conceded the offer was dead. "We respect that decision," he said.
"It means our offer won't be successful since our 90 per cent acceptance condition can't be satisfied. Sadly it 
means the government won't receive EUR200m, and there won't be a 1,000 new jobs created in Aer Lingus over 
the next five years."
Earlier in the day, Mr O'Leary indicated the company might raise its offer above EUR1.40 a share, but any increase 
would have been "small and not the crazy and silly expectations being put out there by some analysts".
John Mattimoe of Merrion Stockbrokers described the Ryanair offer as "clearly not high enough", and said a price of 
EUR2.07-EUR2.67 a share would have had "a realistic chance of engaging the target board in meaningful 
discussions".
An unsuccessful bid in October 2006 priced at EUR2.80 a share was rejected by shareholders and deemed 
anticompetitive by the European Commission, which ruled the merger would "have harmed consumers by removing 
this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties".

United Airlines and Ireland's Aer Lingus unveiled an agreement Thursday to operate a new joint trans-Atlantic 
service between Washington, DC and Spain as part of their recent code-sharing deal.
The two airlines said they would launch a shared Washington Dulles-Madrid service beginning in April 2010 and 
were mulling other possible joint ventures to exploit the year-old "open skies" pact between U.S. and EU aviation 
authorities.
Since November the two airlines' code-sharing has allowed customers to make linked-up journeys on a single 
booking within United's American and Aer Lingus' European route networks. Until now, however, the partners had 
not cooperated in forging any new routes under open skies, which allows airlines to fly from outside their home 
countries.
United chief executive and chairman Glenn Tilton said in a statement that the success of their code-sharing deal 
"provides for a deeper commercial relationship with Aer Lingus, and capitalizes on the unique strengths of both our 
companies."
Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion told a Dublin press conference he expected cooperation with United to 
deepen because both sides were benefiting strongly.
Aer Lingus' corporate planning director, Stephen Kavanagh, told The Associated Press that Aer Lingus would 
provide the crews and aircraft for the Washington-Madrid service but the bulk of traffic would come from United's 
U.S. customers. He said the two airlines would split profits and risks equally.
Aer Lingus has never operated a trans-Atlantic service from outside Ireland before. It currently flies from Ireland to 
New York, Boston, Chicago, Washington and San Francisco, but cut its Los Angeles service last November citing 
the sky-high cost of fuel.
Kavanagh said Aer Lingus was "actively looking" to expand its own trans-Atlantic services from Ireland once again 
now that fuel prices have plummeted. He said reviving the Los Angeles route was a leading candidate.
United , Aer Lingus boost trans-Atlantic pact
Traditionally, U.S. airlines have favored London's Heathrow for their trans-Atlantic services but increasingly are 
seeking less crowded, costly and convenient transfer points.
Aer Lingus operates services between Ireland and six major European short-haul hubs: Heathrow, Amsterdam, 
Frankfurt, Madrid, Paris and Rome. United has other code-sharing partners that operate connecting flights at 
Madrid.
Thursday's deal comes at a time of unusual uncertainty for Aer Lingus, a formerly state-controlled airline that the 
Irish government floated on the Irish and British stock exchanges in 2006.
Aer Lingus is embroiled in a renewed takeover battle with Dublin-based rival Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 no-frills 
carrier, which is already Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder with a 30 percent stake. Ryanair's latest bid, launched last 
month and due to expire Feb. 13, values Aer Lingus at €750 million ($975 million) or €1.40 a share.
Aer Lingus shares were trading 0.8 percent lower Thursday at €1.37 on the Irish Stock Exchange. This reflected 
investors' widespread view that the Ryanair bid will fail at that price, because it has attracted virtually no interest 
from other shareholders.
Earlier Thursday, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told a Dublin press conference he didn't plan to raise the 
€1.40 price on offer and insisted it would be the best that Aer Lingus could hope to get. He forecast that Aer Lingus 
shares would plunge back below €1 if Ryanair's overture was spurned.

Irish govt rejects Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus

Body
The Irish government on Thursday formally rejected Ryanair's bid to acquire rival Aer Lingus, emphasizing it would 
not sell its 25 percent stake in the airline at the Ryanair offer of €1.40 ($1.81) per share.
Transport Minister Noel Dempsey said Ryanair's offer declared Dec. 2 and due to expire Feb. 13 "greatly 
undervalues" the true asset worth of Aer Lingus, the formerly state-controlled airline that went private in 2006.
Dempsey did not rule out a future government acceptance if Ryanair raised its offer but emphasized a fear that any 
merged Ryanair-Aer Lingus airline would create an expensive, less efficient monopoly.
"The cornerstone of Irish aviation policy is, and has been for many years, to encourage competition," Dempsey 
said. "Because we live on an island, Irish consumers depend very heavily on air transport. A monopoly in this area 
would not be in the best interests of Irish consumers."
Ryanair, Europe's premier no-frills airline, offered no immediate reaction.
Ryanair had calculated that the government might be willing to sell its pivotal 25.12 percent stake in Aer Lingus 
because of Ireland's sudden fall into recession a stunning U-turn that has dropped the government's budget deep 
into the red for the first time in 15 years.
But analysts also widely ruled Ryanair's offer, valuing Aer Lingus at €750 million, as far too cheap. The airline has 
€800 million in the bank, and an air fleet, Heathrow slots and other assets worth nearly as much.
Ryanair faces a legal deadline of Jan. 30 to decide whether it wants to raise its offer to nearer €2 per share, the 
level at which some analysts think the government might sell.
Ryanair already is Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder with a 30 percent stake. Acquiring the government's holding 
would be barely sufficient to take control, but Ryanair also has been appealing to Aer Lingus employees and 
worker-controlled trusts that hold at least 15 percent more. Ryanair admits that, so far, it has won few converts on 
that front.
Irish govt rejects Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus
The government retained a 25 percent share when it floated Aer Lingus on the Irish and British stock exchanges 
specifically to block hostile takeovers or the sale of the airline's Heathrow slots.
Earlier Thursday, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told a Dublin press conference that €1.40 share was the 
best that Aer Lingus should expect. He warned that Aer Lingus shares would slide back under €1 their level before 
the Ryanair bid if the offer wasn't accepted.

Body
Time is running out on Ryanair's E750m offer for Aer Lingus with a week left in which Ryanair can change its offer 
conditions and three weeks before the offer period elapses.
At a press briefing today, Ryanair said that it remains open to meeting with Aer Lingus shareholders to discuss any 
areas of concern that they may have in relation to Ryanair's offer to merge with Aer Lingus.
It confirmed its view that the trend of EU airline consolidation continues to accelerate, as evidenced by the EU's 12 
Jan approval of the Vueling/Clickair merger in Spain, and the EU's 19 Jan approval of the Austrian Government's 
investment in Austrian to enable its sale to Lufthansa to proceed.
The new (21 Jan) announcement by Finnair that it is now "open to evaluating a combination with SAS", is 
noteworthy because Finnair was one of the independent airline models previously quoted by Aer Lingus as an 
example of its "independence" strategy, Ryanair said. Ryanair said it was interesting that while all this merger and 
consolidation activity is taking place, no airline other than Ryanair has publicly expressed any interest in Aer Lingus. 
It also referred to details of the European Airline Share Index since 26 Nov 2008 (just prior to its offer). "Over this 
period the average share price of quoted European airlines has fallen by some 6pc. By contrast Aer Lingus' share 
price has risen 34pc, thanks largely Ryanair believes to its takeover offer. Ryanair believes that if its offer is 
unsuccessful on 13 February next, then Aer Lingus' share price will fall substantially as the markets begin to focus 
upon Aer Lingus' adverse fuel hedging position in 2009, and what Ryanair believes will be Aer Lingus' substantial 
post exceptional after tax losses in 2008 and 2009, and the impact of the deepening Irish recession upon Aer 
Lingus' traffic and yields over the coming year or two," it said. Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said: "Ryanair's all 
cash offer of E1.40 per share values Aer Lingus at E748m. At yesterday's closing prices, Ryanair is offering to pay 
almost as much in cash for Aer Lingus as the combined market value of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks plc. 
This is an extremely generous all cash offer at a time of collapsing equity values in Ireland and across Europe." 
Ryanair : Time is running out on AL offer Ryanair AL Bid
"Aer Lingus shareholders and in particular the Government and the ESOT must decide before 13 February whether 
they wish to accept the substantial cash proceeds which will accrue from Ryanair's offer and the 1,000 jobs which 
has Ryanair has committed to creating in Aer Lingus over the next 5 years, if our offer is successful. The 
Government, the ESOT and all other Aer Lingus shareholders must now decide whether they want to accept this 
cash offer and see these 1,000 new jobs created or not."

It added that the offer by Ryanair did not include any proposed remedies for the virtual monopoly which would result

Other considerations also taken into account by Government were the impact of this merger on airports policy and 
consequently on regional development policy. Government was also mindful of the importance of ensuring 
maximum connectivity for Irish air travellers and so concluded that this was best ensured in a competitive market.

prolonged battle if shareholders in Ireland's former state airline continue to oppose the deal.
Ryanair, which has accumulated more than 29pc of Aer Lingus shares, has been pursuing its neighbour at Dublin 
airport for more than two years and in December made a second bid despite opposition from management and staff 
at Aer Lingus.

The ISEQ added to yesterday's sharp losses this morning with AIB shares down 45pc on their opening value after 
losing 60pc in value on Monday.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 37.55 points to 2,236.39.
Shares in AIB have taken a second battering in less two days, losing 60pc yesterday and another 45pc this morning 
as the bank's chief executive, Eugene Sheehy reassured staff that the bank will not be nationalised.
The shares lost 27c so far today and are now worth E0.33. AIB chief executive Eugene Sheehy said in a message 
to employees he believes the bank will remain independent. "We have the depth and strength required to manage 
our way through this period of uncertainty as an independent organisation and I believe we will do so," Mr Sheehy 
said in the message. He said the decision to nationalise Anglo Irish and developments in other countries "have all 
had a knock-on effect on share prices and have led to renewed uncertainty and speculation as to what is going to 
happen next." "I can understand that seeing our share price drop severely is worrying." He said AIB "continues to 
be a strong, sound, internationally diversified organisation". Davy Stockbrokers banking analyst Emer Lang said in 
a note to investors this morning that the Government reaffirmed in a statement last night that it will be proceeding 
with the planned recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. Shares in Bank of Ireland fell by 4c to 
E0.30 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 10c to E1.00. The Government has already committed to invest 
E2bn in preference shares apiece and to support up to a further E1 billion Tier 1 issuance by each. Elsewhere, 
Speedy Hire - a peer of Abbey's hire business in the UK - in a trading statement released this morning, has warned 
that pre-tax profits for the year ending March 2009 will be below expectations. The group now expects to post pre-
tax profits in the range of £33-38m versus consensus estimates of around £50m. Abbey shares were flat at E3.40.

QUICKSTEP GEARING UP FOR PRODUCTION
COMPONENTS Australian technology company Quickstep is gearing up for full-scale composite component 
manufacture using its patented fluid-based curing process following the recent approval for its first aerospace parts 
manufactured at its Fremantle, Western Australia site. The company, which has a manufacturing development 
contract with Airbus, a co-operation and development agreement with Eurocopter and accreditation as an approved 
tenderer from two major manufacturers, has received three new autoclaves.
CAE SECURES CONTRACTS FOR FIVE SIMULATORS
TRAINING CAE has sold to Continental Airlines two Boeing Next Generation 737 full-flight simulators and a flight-
training device for delivery to Continental's Houston training centre in 2009. Another two 737 simulators and one for 
Airbus A320s will in 2010 go to a joint order from Air China and Shandong Airlines. CAE values the deals at roughly 
$60C million ($49 million).
EADS BUYS UK SMALL SATELLITE MAKER
ACQUISITION EADS Astrium has acquired Guildford, UK-based Surrey Satellite Technology, the University of 
Surrey spin-off that specialises in the design and manufacture of small satellites and subsystems. SSTL, which was 
85% owned by the university, will retain its name. Astrium UK chief executive Colin Paynter says: "At Astrium we 
have a healthy orderbook and we are recruiting engineers, scientists and technicians."
EMBRAER DELIVERED 162 REGIONAL JETS IN 2008

including 36 executive jets and six for defence and government customers, a 20% increase on the 169 aircraft 
delivered in 2007. Embraer values its firm order backlog of 426 jets as at the end of December at $20.9 billion.
GULF AIR TO START HEDGING FUEL TO CUT LOSSES
AIRLINES Gulf Air intends soon to start hedging fuel as part of a bid to halt losses. The airline claims it achieved 
the highest revenues in its history last year - although it has yet to disclose any figures - but is uncertain about when 
it will start turning a profit. Chief executive BjA[paragraph]rn NA[currency]f says the fuel-price increases last year 
generated a sense of "urgency" about introducing a hedging policy.

AER LINGUS CHIEFS CUT Terms TO FIGHT RYANAIR
TAKEOVER BID Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion and chief financial officer Sean Coyle have requested, 
and been granted, the removal of a condition in their contracts that would provide for compensation in the event of 
constructive dismissal if the airline were to be acquired by a third party. Mannion says the change was made to 
"focus our attention on defeating the unsolicited bid from Ryanair that fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus".
INDIA MAY EASE AIRLINE OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS
CAPITAL India may ease regulations that bar foreign airlines from owning stakes in its domestic carriers, which 
want better access to foreign capital. Foreign ownership of up to 49% is allowed, but foreign airlines have since 
1997 been barred from owning any shares. A 20-25% ceiling is one option under consideration.

Aren't takeovers great?
Aren't takeovers great?
Sunday Business Post

Section: AGENDA
Length: 325 words
Body
Takeovers are great, no matter what the context.
The Health Service Executive taking over the Irish healthcare system was a great thing, while Brian Cowen and 
Brian Lenihan taking over the running of Ireland has also been a resounding success. The biggest takeover being 
discussed in Ireland at the moment is Ryanair's ongoing attempt to take over Aer Lingus. This is a great idea and 
one that truly deserves all the attention it's getting.
How could any Irish person not want Ryanair to take over Aer Lingus? There is one overriding reason why we must 
all support this absolutely brilliant idea: it will mean more profits for Ryanair.
Presumably Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, has lots of altruistic reasons for wanting to buy the 
former national airline. These could include love of the shamrock, love of Aer Lingus workers, the love of creating 
new jobs and a general love for all things green and Irish.
However, it is also possible that, being a businessman, he wants to make his firm, Ryanair, even more profitable. 
The Irish people, who still own 25 per cent of the airline, have a chance to help O'Leary in his entrepreneurial 
endeavours.
Only good things can come for O'Leary and Ryanair if they buy Aer Lingus. What right do we have to stand in the 
way of those ambitions? Don't forget that it was ambition for more profit that drove the Celtic tiger economy and 
made Ireland into one of the most respected economies in the world for ten years.
It was ambition for profit that drove property developers to keep on building and borrowing in the boom years and 
that kept bankers lending them money. Those were the things that fuelled the Irish economy and brought us to the 
very peak of our success last year.
Another reason to support Ryanair's takeover of Aer Lingus is that it will create a virtual Ryanair-led monopoly of 
flights in and out of Ireland. Have O'Leary and Ryanair ever let people down before when it comes to flights?
Aren't takeovers great?

O'Leary signals new Aer Lingus bid
O'Leary signals new Aer Lingus bid

Section: THE MARKET
Length: 581 words

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has given his strongest indication yet that he will increase his takeover 
offer for Aer Lingus. He has spoken about not increasing his offer to ''stupid'' levels like  2.06 to  2.60 per share. 
Instead, he said that at no point would he make an offer for the former state airline for a price that began with the 
number ''two''.
There is a long-standing tradition and ritual in takeover battles that the bidder says he has no intention of increasing 
his offer and then, when the time comes, he goes ahead and does it. In typical O'Leary style, he broke with tradition 
and indicated that a ''modest'' increase in the offer price would not be a problem, if Aer Lingus shareholders were 
serious about selling.
If price is one of the issues that shareholders have, ''then we would be happy to take their concerns on board'', he 
said, dangling a further carrot that he would increase the price if there was a genuine effort to engage on the 
subject.
This takeover offer is unusual in several respects. The most contentious issue for Aer Lingus shareholders is not 
the price, as evidenced by O'Leary's willingness to indicate he would go higher, but is, in fact, the identity of the 
buyer. There are political, trade union and competition sensitivities involved.
O'Leary emphasised last week that time was running out on this bid. He has until January 30 to increase his offer, 
and the closing date for acceptance is February 13.
The last time Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus, everybody knew, including O'Leary, that the deal had very little chance of 
flying. But the Ryanair chief also planned to have another crack at it at a suitable time. For that reason, he 
cooperated fully with the EU Commission's competition probe into the proposed takeover, even though it was not a 
runner.
This time round, O'Leary is saying that, if the EU Commission opts for a phase II probe, it will prove time-consuming 
and costly, and Ryanair will not engage with the commission on it unless it gets acceptances from either the 
O'Leary signals new Aer Lingus bid
government or the Esot. Whatever about the rationale of this plan, it may point to a belief on Ryanair's part that, if 
the bid is not runner this time, there won't be a third attempt to buy Aer Lingus in the future.
Against the backdrop of deteriorating public finances, O'Leary was pushing all the right buttons. He emphasised the  
200million the exchequer would land from selling its stake in Aer Lingus. He also emphasised how Brian Cowen's 
trip to Japan had yielded 150 new jobs for Ireland, when he is promising to create 1,000 new jobs.
O'Leary comes across as someone getting frustrated with the process. He said he had gleaned nothing on the 
government's thinking on this issue other than its public statement, which said that it had an open mind on the 
issue. He is also seeking a meeting with transport minister Noel Dempsey to discuss the matter.
Aer Lingus's case has not been helped by revelations about the 'golden parachute' clauses inserted into four 
executives' contracts last year. O'Leary pointed out that they were granted at a time when the airline was planning 
job cuts. These have now been withdrawn. The market will no doubt expect an increased offer from O'Leary in the 
coming fortnight of up to  1.99 per share - a figure he is quite fond of in seat sales.
The cards remain firmly stacked against O'Leary as he makes his case to trade unions, pilots and the government. 
But he loves a fight - and he can't be ruled out of this one yet.

AGE: 58
APPEARANCE: tall and distinguished with a snowy beard, like a university professor
NEWSWORTHINESS: as secretary-general of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Begg is at the forefront of 
crucial social partnership talks with the government
When David Begg opened his diary at his office on Parnell Square last week, it read like the headlines of a national 
newspaper. Meeting on Waterford Crystal; RTE's Prime Time; Department of Finance on pay; Department of Social 
and Community Affairs on pensions; Foreign Affairs on Lisbon; RTE's Morning Ireland; Foreign Affairs on Gaza; 
union meeting; government document to finalise.
The secretary general of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) has an enormous amount on his agenda.
Begg is a member of the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) Council, a governor of the Irish Times 
Trust, a director of the Central Bank, a member of the National Economic and Social Council, and a non-executive 
director of Aer Lingus. He was also chair of the board of the Democracy Commission.
The general consensus is that Begg is an intellectually gifted trade unionist. He is articulate, unassuming, reflective 
and highly respected.
With the notable exception of Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, it is difficult to find anyone who has a bad 
word to say about him. Begg's name elicits a string of accolades from colleagues, fellow board members and 
business adversaries alike. They may not agree with him, but they don't dislike him.
Begg to differ
''He was a very effective chairman, and very inclusive," said a board member of the Democracy Commission ,which 
was set up in response to concerns about the nature of democracy in Ireland and, in particular, its capacity to be 
inclusive and egalitarian. ''The nature of the group was that there were lots of people with lots of different opinions. 
He was exceptionally good at summarising key issues and bringing them together. He was also able to tolerate the 
gobshitery that can sometimes go on at these meetings."
Nora Owen, who served with Begg on the Democracy Commission, said she was astounded at his ability ''to 
manage a thousand things at one time and maintain great focus''.
Begg will need all his skills as he faces the biggest challenge of his career: talks with the government on economic 
recovery proposals that are likely to be the most testing in the history of social partnership. As Ictu represents some 
620,000 workers in the Republic of Ireland, the majority of whom (almost 60 per cent) work in the private sector, he 
has a heavy burden on his shoulders.
But Begg is heartened by the public response to pay negotiations in recent weeks, and Fine Gael's call for a pay 
freeze - as opposed to pay cuts - had helped to rally support.
''Fine Gael's position is very different this week to what it was last week, and I think that has garnered support," he 
said.
Begg is no stranger to difficult talks. He became active in the trade union movement while working for the ESB. He 
rose through the ranks at the ESB Officials Association before becoming general-secretary of the Postal 
Telecommunications Workers' Union. That merged with the Communications Union of Ireland to form the 
Communications Workers' Union (CWU) in 1990.
As general-secretary, he led his troops in the acrimonious postal strike. He was also heavily involved in the early 
negotiations that secured staff a 14.9 per cent ownership when Eircom was privatised. Begg has since admitted 
that the privatisation turned out to be ''a major mistake and contrary to the public interest'', despite having been one 
of the main negotiators of the employees' stake in the company. He said the move had turned ''a public monopoly 
into a private monopoly''.
Begg - who was leader of the CWU until 1997,when he left to head the charity, Concern - said his original aim in 
seeking a stake in the company was to prevent it falling into private hands, rather than facilitate the process.
Those who know Begg say he would have been disappointed by the payout that his union successor, Con Scanlon, 
secured.
Scanlon took over from Begg and received a package of  1.8 million. ''David would have been appalled by that," 
said one source. ''It went against everything he stood for, from a moral point of view."
''Moral'', ''ethical'', ''honest'', ''fundamentally decent'', ''full of integrity'' - all these words were consistently used to 
describe Begg by colleagues, associates and indeed adversaries on the employers' side.
Turlough O'Sullivan, director-general of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (Ibec), said: ''I respect him 
very much. He is a very intelligent man, and a challenging adversary. He is very committed to the cause and puts 
forward his arguments very well. He is a modest man, but you wouldn't want to underestimate [him]."
One senior union official said Begg was ''held in very high regard at the executive council table. He brings a real 
intellectual rigour to the job and his strategic thinking is greatly appreciated. He has a more medium and long-term 
view and sees beyond the next month's pay cheque. When he speaks, everyone listens."
Not everyone in the trade union movement is as enamoured of him.
''If you want my honest opinion, here goes," said one trade union leader. ''He should have been a priest or a monk. 
He is not motivated by socialism or left-wing ideals. He is a decent person, but if I were sacked and he came to fight 
for me, I would commit suicide."
Begg to differ
Another source said Begg was not an ''inspirational leader. He is not confrontational. He does not have a fiery style. 
He is no Jim Larkin''.
Begg's critics on the trade union side believe that he is consumed by ideals about social capital and community. He 
sees the mission of the trade union movement in a broader context than do many trade union leaders, whose vision 
is more brass tacks and money-oriented.
''In away, they are right,'' Begg told The Sunday Business Post. ''I do see the social partnership project as being 
primarily about social policy advance, as I would take the view that you don't need a social partnership model in 
order to do wage bargaining.
''I like the activity of industrial relations, but I don't see it as the be-all and end-all. I see my own role as making it a 
more just society. Their evaluation is probably fairly accurate, and I'm not sure I would be as enthusiastic about the 
job if it didn't have the capacity to have a broader influence."
Begg's keen sense of social justice was evident from the moment he took up the post of general-secretary of Ictu in 
2001.
He told delegates at his first conference that speculative flows of capital had caused huge unemployment and 
poverty around the world. He said capitalism had been unbridled since the collapse of the USSR, and the gap 
between the extremely rich and the homeless and poor in industrialised countries was widening.
''I believe that all human beings are morally equal, that we have an equal entitlement to self-determination, that life 
chances should be as equal as possible and that social justice is a condition of liberty."
It was not what most Ictu delegates were used to hearing, but Begg is not your typical union man.
''He is more likely to be at a carol service in St Patrick's Cathedral, as opposed to Mulligan's [pub] with the lads," 
said one source.
''He is not a slap-on-the-back kind of guy," said another.
Begg's four years as head of Concern are believed to have had a profound effect on his social philosophy. He was 
credited with driving the organisation's income from  20 million to  53 million, while reducing its reliance on 
emergency TV campaigns.
Father Aengus Finucane, a co-founder of Concern, said he admired Begg ''as a straight and good man''.
''I felt that his trade union experience meant he would stay close to the people," said Finucane. ''He brought more 
structure and organisation to Concern, and that was the way things had to move."
Tom Arnold, chief executive of Concern and a friend of Begg's, said he believed Begg became a little frustrated and 
impatient at the endless debates that could plague the NGO world.
Begg maintained his interest in the developing world by spending six years on an advisory board for the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, but his term ended recently.
When interviewed by journalist Vincent Browne soon after announcing his departure from Concern, Begg 
acknowledged that his new role at Ictu entailed less important work.
The main reason for leaving Concern, he said, was that he hated travelling. As chief executive of Concern, he 
travelled all over the world on a regular basis. ''I just didn't like being away from home," he said.
Home for Begg is Rolestown, north Dublin, where he has lived all his life. He was one of two children and his father 
worked in the construction business. Begg went to school in Swords and won a scholarship to do engineering in 
Kevin Street, qualifying in 1971.
Begg to differ
Associates describe Begg as a ''family man''. He and his wife, Máire, who works as a school secretary in Swords, 
have three children: two boys and a girl. Their children work in architecture, academia and human resources.
Begg is a devout Catholic and has written for Studies, a quarterly magazine published by the Irish Jesuits that 
examines Irish social, political, cultural and economic issues in the light of Christian values.
He is said to be close to Bishop Brendan Comiskey and Bishop Eamon Casey. He is also a daily communicant, 
often attending Mass at a church on the Quays in Dublin.
''I don't really like to discuss that, but a good lot of what I draw upon is Catholic social teaching," he said. ''In the 
broadest sense, I regard myself as a social democrat."
Begg is a voracious reader and recently completed a master's degree in international relations at Dublin City 
University (DCU).He also has a keen interest in history and has visited World War I battlefields, including Flanders, 
with friends.
His speeches are peppered with quotes from the likes of Noam Chomsky and passages from the Bible, depending 
on his audience.
Begg, who is a member of the Labour Party, said he was ''not influenced by any one person'', but had great 
admiration for American trade unionist Eugene Debs and Hungarian intellectual Karl Polanyi.
He cited left-wing British commentators Will Hutton and John Gray as modern influences. While he makes plenty of 
appearances on television and in newspapers for his work, Begg actively avoids the social circuit.
''I dread receptions and that type of thing," he said. ''On a Friday night, my wife and I usually go for a meal. I live in 
a rural community and socialise with people I have known all my life. I value that enormously."
He took up riding in his 40s after his wife gave him a gift of some horse riding lessons. He is a keen race goer and 
will sometimes catch a film or go to the theatre with his wife at weekends.
Begg has a quiet manner and slight reticence, but he does not pull his punches when aggravated. After it emerged 
that Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion had had changes made to his contract, Begg was not slow to air 
his views.
''The board's permission was not sought," said Begg, referring to a clause inserted to ensure that Mannion stood to 
gain up to  2.8 million if the former state airline was taken over. ''This makes me absolutely mad."
Last Friday, Begg presented Ictu's proposals for dealing with the economic crisis. These are likely to form the basis 
of its talks with the government this week. His diary is unlikely to be uncluttered any time soon.

Ryanair ready to raise Aer Lingus offer

Body
The chief of budget airline Ryanair said Friday he would consider raising the price of the hostile takeover bid for 
rival Aer Lingus, but said Ryanair would not wait more than another three weeks for a response.
Michael O'Leary said Ryanair might pay more than the €1.40 ($1.86) per share it has already offered but would not 
consider paying €2 or more per share.
"We are not stupid people and will not pay stupid prices," he said, urging the Irish government and Aer Lingus 
shareholders to act quickly on the proposed takeover.
"Our offer will deliver almost €750 million to Aer Lingus shareholders, including almost €190 million for the Irish 
government as well as 1,000 new jobs in Aer Lingus at a time when thousands of jobs are being lost in Ireland," 
O'Leary said.
He predicted Aer Lingus shares would sink badly if the deal does not go through by the Feb. 13 deadline set by 
Ryanair.
Aer Lingus shares were trading above the current offer price, at €1.60 per share on the Irish Stock Exchange Friday 
afternoon, unchanged from Thursday. Ryanair was trading at €3.26, a 2 percent rise, on the London Stock 
Exchange.
O'Leary said the company hoped to meet shortly with Ireland's Minister of Transport to outline the advantages of 
the offer. He said he would use the meeting to emphasize that a decision must be made on Ryanair's offer within 
the next three weeks.
The company has tried in the past to take over Aer Lingus, but has met opposition from the management and staff. 
This takeover bid was launched in earnest last month.
In early December, O'Leary said Ryanair would double Aer Lingus' short haul fleet within five years, create 1,000 
new jobs for pilots, cabin crews and engineers, and move Aer Lingus into new locations in Britain and Europe. He 
said Aer Lingus faced job losses and revenue falls if the takeover was blocked.
Ryanair ready to raise Aer Lingus offer
An earlier takeover attempt in 2006 was rejected by the Irish government.
Ryanair released a statement Friday indicating that it would not engage in protracted negotations unless the 
proposal has "significant prior support" from Aer Lingus shareholders.

Ryanair has made clear that it will drop its bid for Aer Lingus in the event of a detailed EU competition probe, unless 
the takeover is backed by either the government or Aer Lingus employees.
In a statement this morning, the low cost carrier sais it had failed notice of its bid with the EU Competition 
Commission on 8 January.
"The Commission is expected to determine within 25 working days ("Phase I') whether the proposed merger will be 
approved, or to initiate a more detailed "Phase II" process," the statement says.
"Any Phase II process will absorb substantial government, EU and company resources. "Ryanair does not see any

lengthy Phase II review process with the EU unless it receives such support from Aer Lingus shareholders, 
including the acceptance of the Offer by either the Irish Government or the ESOT ( employee share ownership trust 
)." Ryanair says its current offer will remain open for acceptance until 13 February, and that the last effective date 
for any change to the terms of its offer will be 30 January, 2009. The statement says that Ryanair hopes to meet 
shortly with the Minister for Transport and/ or his advisers to highlight the substantial cash proceeds for 
shareholders and 1,000 new jobs which Ryanair has committed to deliver in Aer Lingus should its offer be

substantial post-exceptional, after-tax losses as well as a significant hole in its pension schemes. "However, we 
don't intend to waste our time or that of the Irish Government or EU Commission over the next six months if Aer 
Lingus shareholders do not want the only merger offer currently available to them to secure Aer Lingus' future".

Colm Barrington is a keen yachtsman who for several years held the record time for circumnavigating Ireland. As 
chairman of Aer Lingus, he has found himself in stormy waters as he tries to fend off the second attempt by low-
cost competitor Ryanair to take it over.
Mr Barrington, 63, had only been chairman for seven weeks when Michael O'Leary, the aggressive chief executive 
of Ryanair, made an opportunistic bid for Aer Lingus, in which the Irish government holds 25 per cent of the shares 
and the employees hold 16 per cent. Ryanair itself owns nearly 30 per cent and pitched its new offer at exactly half 
the price of its old one, which it made in 2006.
Mr Barrington, whose day job is CEO of Babcock & Brown Air, the Irish aircraft leasing group, had enough on his 
plate. Aer Lingus was meant to be 25 days work a year but has already provided 50.
In a video interview with FT.com, Mr Barrington argues that Aer Lingus has an independent future, explains why the 
Irish economy could take until 2011 to recover and why the Irish people were irresponsible to reject the European 
Union's Lisbon Treaty. Edited highlights appear below.
What is worse: oil at $147 a barrel or a global recession?
I think global recession is probably worse than oil at $147 a barrel. If demand for your business is good, then you 
can probably face high oil prices, but if demand goes away, then things are more difficult.
How bad are things going to get in the real economy this year?
Hopefully this won't go on forever, but at the moment all the indications are that 2009 is going to be a very difficult 
year.
When do you predict an economic recovery?
Certainly in Ireland I think it's going to be next year at the very earliest, and probably . . . 2011. I think in the US it 
could actually be quicker, particularly if Obama gets his package through.
View from the Top - Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus
Do you think governments need to do more?
As a Keynesian, I would generally think, yes, they do, and the more they do the better.
Are you more worried about deflation or the potential return of inflation later on?
We could probably do with a little bit of inflation at the moment to get people out of some of their problems.
Inflate away the debt?
I wouldn't say inflate it away, but certainly make it less difficult for people. So, a little bit of inflation over the course 
of 2009-2010 would be helpful.
What will happen to the oil price?
Who knows? But presumably, if demand stays low for 2009, we'll see oil prices stay down.
How bad could things get for Ireland?
Quite bad. Our economy over the last few years, as you know, has been doing very nicely, but has been doing very 
well on a property boom. That sector has now virtually stopped. This has had a significant effect on both the 
economy and on tax revenues. We've really had a few big, bad blows in the past few months, which I think are 
going to hurt us very significantly into 2009.
Could Ireland even default on its public debt?
Again, it's very hard to see. But on the other hand, I didn't think the Bank of Ireland would be in the position it is in 
now, six months ago. So, that is always a possibility. [But] I think the Irish economy is strong enough to support its 
public debt.
What would get Ireland out of this funk?
Growth in the US will be very important to us and that's something which we're obviously hoping the US will get 
going more quickly than the rest of the world. Obviously, our banking sector is in tatters, so we need to get that 
sector sorted and moving.
What are the chances that we see another rejection of the Lisbon Treaty?
It's always possible. I personally hope not. I think the EU has been a fantastic asset for Ireland. Our rejection of it 
last year was just stupid and outrageous. The EU could easily say, well look, sorry we're going to go ahead without 
Ireland, and Ireland, you're not in the EU any more.
Is it time for the government to cash in on its Aer Lingus stake?
If Ryanair's bid were successful, the government would get about EUR185m (£167m) from Ryanair's bid, and in the 
context of where they are I don't think that's a very significant amount of money for the government. So I don't think 
that will be a significant factor in their decision-making.
How can Aer Lingus survive independently?
There is no reason why Aer Lingus can't survive as an independent airline. Ryanair has put out this sort of, I was 
going to say, big lie about consolidation being the name of the game. There are over 30 independent airlines in 
Europe of Aer Lingus' size. Aer Lingus has managed to compete with Ryanair successfully for over 20 years.
But isn't consolidation still the name of the game?
View from the Top - Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus
Funnily enough, a lot of that information comes from big players. The only significant consolidation in Europe in the 
last six years has been Air France-KLM, and that was five years ago last October. Since then we've had British 
Airways talk about Iberia; we've had British Airways talk about Qantas . . . It hasn't actually happened. We've had 
Lufthansa hoover up a few bankrupt or semi-bankrupt airlines in its region.
Do you need a white knight?
The only reason we would like to have somebody else in our shareholder register is that Ryanair owns nearly 30 
per cent of us, which is outrageous - that your biggest competitor can control 30 per cent of your shares.
Who would want to be on your register alongside Ryanair?
It would be difficult for another airline to be on our shareholder register, but what we need is to find some strategic 
shareholder who, with some of our other strategic shareholders, will give us a balance over Ryanair.
Would that be a bank?
It could be anybody. Obviously, I don't want to go too far into that right now. But meanwhile, we are pushing every 
way we can on anti-competitive grounds to have Ryanair's shareholding reduced.

Shares in the big two Irish banks dropped this morning after last night's dramatic announcement that Anglo Irish is 
to be nationalised.
AIB shares shed 16c in early trade to 177, while Bank of Ireland was down 3c to 86.
The drops were a reflection of how the Anglo move is perceived by the international investment community.
Showing that the affairs of the bank were in a worse state than previously feared, the nationalisation has done little 
other than to stoke fears about the market here. Irish Life and Permanent, which is now something of a lacuna in 
the troubled financial sector, saw its shares gain by 9c this morning to 234. The ISEQ index overall has gained 
28.51 points this morning to 2,508.23, as other shares here benefitted from an overnight global bounce. CRH was 
up 44c to 1800, with kerry ahead by 14c to 1470. Ryanair jumped 13c after indicating that it may drop its bid for Aer 
Lingus if it doesn't get some encouragement soon. Bur C and C was down 12c to 110 after its latest quarterly 
figures showed a 13pc drop in sales.

News In Brief
## Anglo Irish Bank is expected to name the head of the bank's UK operations, Declan Quilligan, as its new chief 
executive. The bank has said it intends to announce a new chief executive before the extraordinary general meeting 
in Dublin tomorrow where shareholders will vote on the Government's plan to invest 1.5 bn euro in the bank. - Irish 
Times
## The ESB has become the latest large employer to ignore the recession and agree to pay the first phase of the 
new national pay deal to 4,000 of its staff. The board of the semi-state company has sanctioned the 3.5pc pay 
increase for blue collar workers and, according to Industrial Relations News will now consider payment of the first 
phase to its white-collar staff. - Irish Examiner
## Corporate finance house IBI has been confirmed as the government's financial adviser on Ryanair's bid for Aer 
Lingus. The selection comes more than six weeks after Ryanair first announced its plans to make a second 
controversial bid to take over the former national airline. A spokeswoman for the Department of Transport last night 
insisted contracts had not yet been signed . - Irish Independent ## The Department of Finance has proposed that 
up to 4,000 health sector staff should go as part of the government's planned voluntary redundancy scheme. In a 
proposal for government, which is expected to be considered next week, the Department of Finance has 
recommended that 2,000 personnel could go this year, mainly from the Health Service Executive, while 2,000 more 
could go next year from the wider health sector including voluntary agencies and hospitals. - Irish Times ## A father 
and son have denied laundering some of the proceeds of the £26.5m Northern Bank robbery. Timothy "Ted" 
Cunningham (60) and Timothy John Cunningham (33) yesterday pleaded not guilty to a total of 24 charges of 
money laundering relating to sums in excess of £3m. Ted Cunningham faces a total of 20 charges while his son, 
Timothy John Cunningham, faces four charges. The two men have addresses in Farran, Co Cork, though Timothy

John Cunningham now resides in Bandon, Co Cork. - Irish Independent ## NCB Stockbrokers has asked senior 
staff to stomach a 20pc pay cut in the event it does not remain profitable this year amid an ongoing downturn in 
financial markets. The move will affect members of the broker's 160-strong workforce on a salary of over 50,000 
euro. It is understood to be based on profitability targets for each of its divisions, including institutional equities, 
wealth management, corporate finance, and investment funds and debt securities. - Irish Independent ## The 
company operating Dublin's five-star Shelbourne Hotel will ask the Supreme Court tomorrow to continue a stay on a 
High Court order directing it to give the hotel owners access to its books and records. Torriam Hotel Operating 
Company, part of the Marriott international hotel group, wants the stay to continue pending the outcome of its 
appeal against a decision of Mr Justice Peter Kelly last month requiring it to make available to Shelbourne Hotel 
Holding Company Ltd a range of material including minutes of management meetings, Torriam's internal control 
system manual and details of internal audits and reports. - Irish Examiner ## Two Irish-listed investment funds who 
have fallen prey to the alleged USD 50bn Bernard Madoff fraud have begun High Court legal proceedings against 
an Irish arm of banking giant HSBC. The investor lawsuits, the first of their kind to have been lodged in Ireland 
following the arrest of the former NASDAQ chairman, have been filed against HSBC Institutional Trust Services 
(Ireland). The funds suing the bank are Dublin-based Thema International Fund plc, which invested with Madoff, 
and AA (Alternative Advantage) plc which suspended dealings in Landmark Investment Fund Ireland last month 
because it was not able to obtain confirmation regarding the safe custody of its assets. - Irish Independent ## Over 
100 Irish jobs at troubled music and entertainment chain, Zavvi, were saved in a last-minute deal with rival HMV 
yesterday. Zavvi's provisional liquidator, David Hughes of Ernst and Young, confirmed that five of its stores in the 
Republic will be sold immediately to HMV in a move that will save 110 jobs in the business. The staff will transfer to 
the new owner. However, Ernst and Young announced that four stores in Northern Ireland, at Belfast, Derry, Newry 
and Newtownabbey, are closing with the loss of 60 posts, while another in Blanchardstown, Dublin, that employs 13 
people, faces the same fate. - Irish Times ## Ryanair is challenging a ruling by the takeover panel that has banned 
airline chief executives Michael O'Leary and Dermot Mannion from taking part in a hotly anticipated television 
debate. The debate could take place as soon as tonight depending on how the proceedings pan out. - Irish 
Examiner ## An Bord Pleanala has refused planning permission for a shopping centre which was to be at the heart 
of a large-scale development on the outskirts of Greystones, Co Wicklow. The planning authority granted 
permission for other elements of the town centre style scheme on a 100-acre site at Charlesland, some 3km from 
Greystones town centre, including offices, an enterprise centre and sites for a proposed new Garda station and 
primary school. A report by an An Bord Pleanala inspector said the shopping centre would conflict with national 
policy, which would favour the location of such a facility in the town centre. - Irish Times

Ireland West Airport Knock today announced its first ever scheduled European flights as Ryanair is set to 
commence a twice weekly service direct to Alicante International Airport in Southern Spain.
This latest expansion at Ireland West Knock will generate an estimated 16,000 additional annual passengers at the 
Airport this summer, it said.
Commenting on the new route Lesley Kane, Head of Sales & Marketing, Ryanair said: "Ireland West Airport Knock 
today celebrates the announcement of Alicante as a new destination. The route will go on sale today and will begin 
from 30th March. With a total of six low fare routes from Ireland Knock this summer passengers, can beat the 
recession by flying at Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel surcharges to Bristol, East Midlands, Liverpool, 
Stansted, Luton and now Alicante. Ryanair's passengers will sustain 400 local jobs and provide more than E47 
million in tourism revenue for the west of Ireland and its surrounding regions next year. To celebrate this new route 
at Ireland West Airport Knock, Ryanair is offering a million E1 seats for travel in February and March."

Ireland West Airport Knock today announced its first ever scheduled European flights as Ryanair is set to 
commence a twice weekly service direct to Alicante International Airport in Southern Spain.
This latest expansion at Ireland West Knock will generate an estimated 16,000 additional annual passengers at the

recession by flying at Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel surcharges to Bristol, East Midlands, Liverpool,

million in tourism revenue for the west of Ireland and its surrounding regions next year. To celebrate this new route 
at Ireland West Airport Knock, Ryanair is offering a million E1 seats for travel in February and March."

Highlight: Ryanair will raise its E750 million offer for rival airline Aer Lingus in January, and that could move 
shareholders to accept it, analysts at Merrion Capital said today.
Body
Ryanair will raise its E750 million offer for rival airline Aer Lingus in January, and that could move shareholders to 
accept it, analysts at Merrion Capital said today.
Ryanair has said repeatedly that its offer of E1.40 per share was generous and it was confident of its success, but 
holders of only 0.01pc of Aer Lingus shares accepted it by an initial Jan. 5 deadline, which Ryanair extended to 
Feb. 13.
Aer Lingus has said the offer undervalued it and could not go through.
"We believe Ryanair's intent is serious and that it will raise its offer - and will do so before the last date for amending 
its offer, Jan. 30," analysts at Merrion said in a research note. "In that event, we would expect ordinary Aer Lingus 
shareholders to urge their board to engage meaningfully with the bidder, as Ryanair is likely to be precluded from 
returning for 12 months if its offer lapses," Dublin-based Merrion said, maintaining a "Buy" recommendation for Aer 
Lingus stock. Shares in Aer Lingus were up 0.6pc at E1.57 and have traded above the Ryanair offer price since 
Dec. 5, four days after Ryanair's offer, which it made at half the price of an earlier failed bid in 2006. Ryanair, which 
already owns almost 30pc of the former state airline, said its offer represented a 28pc premium over Aer Lingus 
shares' average closing price for the 30 days to Nov. 28, the last trading day before the offer. "Ryanair's offer price 
of E1.40 per share for Aer Lingus is clearly not high enough," Merrion said. "We believe that an offer price would 
have to be at least within the E2.07 to E2.67 range to have a realistic chance of engaging the target board in 
meaningful discussions. The Irish government and Aer Lingus employee group ESOT, which own 25pc and 14pc of 
Aer Lingus, respectively, and which rejected Ryanair's 2006 offer, have not published their intentions this time. 
Unions at Aer Lingus are opposing the offer. "A more realistic offer price from Ryanair will force the government to 
clarify its stance on non-price issues," Merrion said.

News In Brief
## Trade unions will "refuse to engage" in social partnership negotiations if the government pushes ahead with 
signalled public sector pay cuts, a senior trade union leader has warned. Former Irish Congress of Trade Unions 
president Peter McLoone, who leads the Impact trade union, also said "there is concern that Brian Cowen's agenda 
is simply to see what the unions can do to assist in the saving of an extra 2bn euro, and then to just bank that". 
Strong resistance to the Government's plan for cuts in the public pay bill - either through pay cuts or job losses - 
was also expressed yesterday by Ictu general secretary David Begg. He said if the Government cut back on wages 
"you will have a compounding effect and deepen this deflationary spiral. It would be wholly the wrong thing to do. 
Certainly, we wouldn't go down that road". - Irish Times
## As speculation mounts that Pfizer is planning a E4bn bid for Irish drug company Elan, it has emerged that Kelly 
Martin's firm has implemented a 'poison pill' strategy to protect it against hostile takeovers. Tysabri is the plum 
bauble in Elan's drug cabinet. Some analysts expect the controversial drug, which treats MS, to generate sales of 
more than USD 1bn per year soon. As major drug companies struggle to maintain a strong pipeline of blockbuster 
products, Elan's Tysabri is viewed as being particularly attractive. It has emerged that Elan has protected itself from 
unwanted takeover by entering an arrangement whereby it may have to sell its share in Tysabri if it is taken over. 
"Our collaborative agreement with Biogen provides Biogen with an option to buy the rights to Tysabri in the event 
we undergo a change of control which may limit our attractiveness to potential acquirors," according to Elan 
documents. - Sunday Independent
## Ryanair has held talks with representatives from Niagara Falls Airport with a view to launching a direct 
transatlantic service from Dublin to the tourist spot. The budget airline has previously said it is anxious to operate 
international services for as little as 10 euro. The talks with the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA) 
Unions will "refuse to discuss" pay cuts Unions Say No
took place at Dublin Airport last Friday, according to a Ryanair spokesperson. She could not confirm what was said 
at the meeting but added it took place at the request of the NFTA. - Irish Examiner. ## The number of failed 
companies has more than doubled over the past 12 months -- a figure described as "staggering" by the financial 
advisory firm, FGS, which compiled the data. Between January and December 2008, 753 Irish companies were 
placed in Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation, High Court Liquidation, Receivership or Examinership, compared with 
370 corporate failures recorded in the same period last year. Declan Taite, the firm's Corporate Restructuring & 
Insolvency Partner, said it was of particular concern that some 37pc of the failures occurred in the final three 
months of 2008. The problems in the construction sector are obvious from the statistics, with 40pc of all failures 
occurring in this industry. - Irish Independent ## Attempts are being made to rescue Ireland's 200m euro beef trade 
with Italy, which has "almost ground to a halt" because of the dioxin scare, according to industry sources. Beef 
producers in Italy are facing difficulties getting Irish-born cattle slaughtered at meat plants, orders for live cattle have 
been cancelled and the beef trade has slowed to a trickle because of veterinary certification demands from the 
Italians. - Irish Times ## Finance minister Brian Lenihan is expected to consider candidates from outside Ireland as 
a replacement for financial regulator Patrick Neary, who will step down at the end of the month. Following criticism 
in some sections of the international media of Ireland's financial system as "cosy capitalism at its worst" a new set 
of guidelines on selecting a financial regulator are to be unveiled in the coming weeks. The guidelines are expected 
to contain a recommendation that international candidates are included in any short list of prospective regulators 
considered by the minister. - Irish Examiner ## New vehicle sales fell by 64 per cent in the first five days of trading 
in 2009, compared to last year. The beginning of January is normally a boom time for car showrooms, but the 
figures from the National Vehicle and Drivers File show that just 9,390 vehicles were registered in the first five days 
of January, compared with 26,029 for the same period in 2008. The figures also show a major shift toward diesel-
fuelled vehicles, encouraged by Government measures favouring cars with lower CO2 emissions. Only two of the 
top 10 sellers use petrol and the rest are powered by diesel; last year, nine out of the top 10 were petrol driven. - 
Irish Times ## Barry Maloney's venture capital firm Balderton has defied the credit crunch and raised USD 430m in 
one of the biggest fundraising exercises in Europe for months. Maloney, who has made a fortune spotting future 
stars, has invested in the likes of Bebo, Setanta and Betfair long before they took off. The group is the largest 
investor in the Irish technology sector. The fund has been backed by US and European investors, with Maloney and 
his partners also committing funds. - Sunday Independent

with Italy, which has "almost ground to a halt" because of the dioxin scare, according to industry sources. Beef 
producers in Italy are facing difficulties getting Irish-born cattle slaughtered at meat plants, orders for live cattle have 
been cancelled and the beef trade has slowed to a trickle because of veterinary certification demands from the 
Italians. - Irish Times ## Finance minister Brian Lenihan is expected to consider candidates from outside Ireland as 
a replacement for financial regulator Patrick Neary, who will step down at the end of the month. Following criticism 
in some sections of the international media of Ireland's financial system as "cosy capitalism at its worst" a new set 
of guidelines on selecting a financial regulator are to be unveiled in the coming weeks. The guidelines are expected 
to contain a recommendation that international candidates are included in any short list of prospective regulators 
considered by the minister. - Irish Examiner ## New vehicle sales fell by 64 per cent in the first five days of trading

figures from the National Vehicle and Drivers File show that just 9,390 vehicles were registered in the first five days 
of January, compared with 26,029 for the same period in 2008. The figures also show a major shift toward diesel-
fuelled vehicles, encouraged by Government measures favouring cars with lower CO2 emissions. Only two of the 
top 10 sellers use petrol and the rest are powered by diesel; last year, nine out of the top 10 were petrol driven. -

Global equity markets are likely to remain extremely volatile for most of this year before finally showing signs of 
recovery towards the end of the year.
That's according to Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM) - the country's largest investment company - in its market 
outlook for 2009 published today.
Senior Equity Strategist James Forbes warns that equity investors should be braced for further poor economic and 
corporate news and current 2009 earnings forecasts are likely to be substantially reduced. He forecasts a 'roller-
coaster' ride for equity markets in 2009, with significant moves up and down before finally showing signs of 
recovery towards the end of the year.
Forbes says that for long-term investors such as pension funds, it is probably too late to reduce their equity holdings 
and that their strategy during 2009 should be to add to holdings at attractive levels during the year. "Missing some 
of the best days in the market can significantly affect longer-term performance". The ILIM strategist expects that 
equity markets will be generally supportive towards President-elect Obama's moves to boost the US economy. 
"Investors could react positively to the massive fiscal stimulus that he will announce. A potential rally in markets in 
early 2009 could become self-fulfilling and investors may begin to feel that they started the year with far too bearish 
views. The rally could then begin to force some investors to 'chase' it and allocate funds from cash and bonds into 
equities". Forbes says, however, that he expects de-leveraging in the US to take longer than many equity investors 
anticipate and that this could temper hopes of economic recovery in the latter part of the year. "This would likely 
cause great uncertainty with equity investors and markets could give up the gains during the summer months and 
into the latter part of 2009 as investor expectations are dashed," he warns. On the Irish stock market, Forbes warns 
that share prices in the financial sector will remain under pressure for the first few quarters due to looming rights 
issues by AIB and Bank of Ireland. He adds that the prospects for the ISEQ hinge largely on the prospects for CRH, 
09 a roller-coaster year for investment; Invest Forecast
Ryanair, Elan, Aryzta and Kerry Group which "continue to trade at relatively attractive levels and should offer 
reasonable potential for capital appreciation throughout the year." Forbes forecasts a very difficult year for the Irish 
economy with GDP shrinking by 4pc. He warns that to regain Ireland's price and cost-competitiveness will require 
painful structural reforms, corporate restructuring and wage moderation and that Irish inflation will fall back to zero 
from 4pc in 2008. Forbes predicts that headline inflation in the US will fall to zero and that the Federal Reserve will 
keep interest rates low as long as is necessary to stimulate spending and expects Eurozone interest rates to fall to 
1.5pc in early 2009 with Eurozone inflation falling to about 1pc from 3.4pc in 2008.

Aer Lingus chief drops `golden handshake'
Aer Lingus chief drops `golden handshake'

Body
The chief executive of Ireland's Aer Lingus airline, Dermot Mannion, on Friday surrendered a politically explosive 
"golden handshake" from his contract that would have rewarded him €2.8 million ($3.8 million) if he resigned 
following a Ryanair takeover.
Ryanair had embarrassed Mannion by exposing the existence of the clause last week. The rival Dublin airline 
demanded an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to question Mannion about how he got such a 
massive takeover-linked payout in his contract without investor knowledge or approval.
Analysts called the deal a conflict of interest for Mannion, who leads the company's battle against the Ryanair 
takeover bid but could collect millions by failing. Ryanair insisted that, if it gained control, Mannion would be 
expected to stay at the helm and shouldn't be permitted to cash in by quitting.
The Aer Lingus board convened Friday to limit the public-relations damage after other key players in the takeover 
battle labor union leaders and the Irish government both voiced anger at the ethics of Mannion's contract terms. 
Transport Minister Noel Dempsey said the government might back Ryanair's demand for a shareholder meeting 
unless Mannion retreated.
Mannion and the airline's chief financial officer, Sean Coyle, who also gave up a Ryanair-linked payoff from his 
contract Friday, said in a joint statement they "have no hesitation in terminating this condition with immediate effect 
in order to focus our attention on defeating the unsolicited bid from Ryanair."
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he welcomed Mannion's "flip-flop" and accused Mannion of trying to 
defraud shareholders by keeping his "indefensible and illegal `failure fee'" confidential.
"This payment, which did not have the support of the (Aer Lingus) board let alone the shareholders, was nothing 
less than an attempt to defraud the company and its shareholders," O'Leary said.
Ryanair launched a hostile bid for Aer Lingus in October 2006, barely a week after the government floated 75 
percent of the previously state-owned airline on the Irish and British stock exchanges.
Aer Lingus chief drops `golden handshake'
Since then, Ryanair has become the biggest Aer Lingus shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake and is hoping 
that Ireland's cash-strapped government will sell Ryanair its remaining 25 percent holding. Aer Lingus' unionized 
labor force represents the third-biggest shareholder and bitterly opposes Ryanair.
Ryanair is appealing a European Union competition ruling in June 2007 that rejected Ryanair's plans to acquire Aer 
Lingus on the grounds that it would undermine competition and create an Irish air monopoly.
Ryanair launched a new takeover bid last month, and this week extended its deadline to Feb. 13 for other 
shareholders to accept an offer of €1.40 a share. The airline conceded that virtually no other shareholders have 
signed letters accepting the offer.
Before Mannion's announcement, Aer Lingus shares rose 2 percent to close at €1.53 on the Irish Stock Exchange.

The transport minister is prepared to support budget airline Ryanair's call for an extraordinary general meeting of 
Aer Lingus investors to discuss changes made to its chief executive's contract.
A spokeswoman said Noel Dempsey was unhappy Aer Lingus had agreed a new package with Dermot Mannion, 
which could see him walk away with up to E2.8 million if the former state airline was taken over.
The spokeswoman confirmed a media report that Dempsey was prepared to support the calling of an EGM.
Changes to Mannion's contract were signed off by Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman before he stepped down in 
October. The airline declined to comment, but Aer Lingus board member David Begg told RTE radio he was 
infuriated with the package, particularly as the airline plans to cut about 200 jobs and has implemented a pay freeze 
to curtail costs. "The board's permission was not sought," said Begg, who is also head of the Irish Congress of 
Trade Unions. "This makes me absolutely mad." Dempsey has written to Aer Lingus informing it he will not be 
attending a farewell dinner for Sharman later this month in light of details of Mannion's compensation package. 
Ryanair, which owns nearly 30 percent of Aer Lingus stock, had called for an EGM earlier this week to discuss the 
package. Dempsey's support will be a boost to Ryanair, which launched a hostile E750 million takeover for Aer 
Lingus last year and is attempting to woo the government, which owns about 25 percent of Aer Lingus. However, 
Europe's largest budget airline has had to extend the offer period for the bid to Feb. 13 from Jan. 5 after minimal 
interest from investors.

attending a farewell dinner for Sharman later this month in light of details of Mannion's compensation package. 
Ryanair, which owns nearly 30 percent of Aer Lingus stock, had called for an EGM earlier this week to discuss the 
package. Dempsey's support will be a boost to Ryanair, which launched a hostile E750 million takeover for Aer 
Lingus last year and is attempting to woo the government, which owns about 25 percent of Aer Lingus. However, 
Europe's largest budget airline has had to extend the offer period for the bid to Feb. 13 from Jan. 5 after minimal 
interest from investors.

Body
The transport minister is prepared to support budget airline Ryanair's call for an extraordinary general meeting of 
Aer Lingus investors to discuss changes made to its chief executive's contract.
A spokeswoman said Noel Dempsey was unhappy Aer Lingus had agreed a new package with Dermot Mannion, 
which could see him walk away with up to E2.8 million if the former state airline was taken over.
The spokeswoman confirmed a media report that Dempsey was prepared to support the calling of an EGM.
Changes to Mannion's contract were signed off by Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman before he stepped down in 
October. The airline declined to comment, but Aer Lingus board member David Begg told RTE radio he was 
infuriated with the package, particularly as the airline plans to cut about 200 jobs and has implemented a pay freeze 
to curtail costs. "The board's permission was not sought," said Begg, who is also head of the Irish Congress of 
Trade Unions. "This makes me absolutely mad." Dempsey has written to Aer Lingus informing it he will not be 
attending a farewell dinner for Sharman later this month in light of details of Mannion's compensation package.

Dublin shares headed lower this morning in line with a fall on world markets after Wall Street slumped on renewed 
fears of a global recession.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 16.87 points at 2,604.69.
Overnight in the US, the Dow Jones slid 245 points (2.71pc) to 8,770 after the closing bell, while the tech-heavy 
Nasdaq composite slumped 53 points (3.23pc) to 1,599 after the market was rocked by jobless figures that were far 
worse than expected.
Today, London's FTSE was down 49 points (1pc) to stand at 4,459 by 11am, ahead of an expected half a 
percentage point rate cut by the Bank of England later today. This would bring UK rates to a new record low of 
1.5pc. The Paris CAC sank 46 points (1.4pc) to 3,300 while the Frankfurt DAX had lost 62 points (1.3pc) to 8,876. 
Back in Dublin, bank shares put in another lacklustre performance with AIB up 2c to E1.90, Bank of Ireland also up 
2c to E0.92, Anglo Irish fell by 2c to E0.24 following a slight bounce on Wednesday after the resignation of finance 
director, William McAteer while Irish Life and Permanent jumped 20c to E2.11. The share price of US regional bank, 
M and T, part-owned by AIB, dropped 7pc last night and at USD50 is worth only around E450m to Allied Irish 
Banks' capital ratios should they decide to dispose of it. This is around 30bps and compares with the E1bn Davy

Ryanair has lodged a formal complaint with the Takeover Panel over what is says is a false claim by Aer Lingus in 
the war of words between the two sides.
The low cost carrier objects to an assertion by the flag carrier that Ryanair's bid for it ignores substantial 
competition issues and is therefore not capable of completion.
Ryanair claims this assertion is "completely false" and that even to make it is a breach of takeover rules.
As a result, it says it has lodged its formal complaint with the Takeover Panel. In a statement on the matter, Ryanair 
chief executive Michael O'Leary says the point was clearly addressed by the European Commission in June 2007 
when Commissioner Kroes stated 'the European Commission does not rule out a future merger between Ryanair 
Holdings plc and Aer Lingus Group plc under the right conditions'. He added: 'The reality is that the new Ryanair 
Offer is capable of completion, and Aer Lingus' claims to the contrary are false and in breach of Takeover Rules.' In 
a further swing at the former state owned airline, O'Leary has written to Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington to 
question whether his airline has a viable independent future. Among the claims he makes is that Aer Lingus' own 
advisor, Goldman Sachs, doesn't believe it has. "In its latest airline research paper (3 Dec. 2008)," O'Leary writes, 
"Goldman Sachs confirmed its belief that 'it seems inevitable that all European carriers will belong to one of the big 
three groups (BA, Lufthansa and AF-KLM) either through direct ownership or deeper alliances'. "Is there any 
independent expert outside of Aer Lingus who has any faith that your independence strategy will be successful?"

Highlight: No-frills airline, Ryanair, today said it has hedged half of its total fuel needs for the first three quarters of

Body
No-frills airline, Ryanair, today said it has hedged half of its total fuel needs for the first three quarters of its fiscal 
year 2009/2010 making a 42pc saving compared to the same period in the previous year.
Crude oil fell to nearly USD48 a barrel this afternoon compared to its peak of USD124 a barrel last September.
On November 3, 2008 Ryanair announced that it was 25pc hedged for the first and second quarters of fiscal 
2009/10 at an average cost of USD770 per tonne (equivalent to around USD70 per barrel of crude).
As a result of this recent increase in its hedging position, Ryanair's average cost per tonne for the 50pc hedged in 
fiscal 2009/10 is USD700 (equivalent to approx. USD64 per barrel of crude). The average cost per tonne in the 
current year (fiscal 2008/09) was USD1,220 (equivalent to approx. USD110 per barrel of crude) for the first three 
quarters. This increase in Ryanair's jet fuel hedging position will deliver, on average, a 42pc reduction in Ryanair's 
hedged cost per tonne compared to the same period in fiscal 2008/09, it said. Commenting on Ryanair's extended 
hedging position, CEO Michael O'Leary said: "We have taken advantage of the recent fall in fuel prices to extend 
our hedging position and we now have 50pc of our requirement for the first 3 Quarters of fiscal 2009/2010 at 
USD700 per tonne (equivalent to approx. USD64 pbl of crude). This will lock in a 42pc reduction of our hedged fuel 
cost per passenger compared to fiscal 2008/09, and will enable Ryanair to continue to grow traffic and reduce fares, 
during these recessionary times, when most airlines are increasing them.

Aer Lingus expects to make a profit for 2008, despite an operating loss of around 20m euro for the year.
It says it will be pulled into the black by income from interest on its huge cash pile.
The airline also says it expects to make a profit next year on the back of at least 50m euro in savings from ideals 
done with staff over the past year.
Aer Lingus says it will also benefit from lower fuel prices, having hedged 72pc of its fuel needs for this year at USD 
911 a tonne for 2009. The airline released the forward estimates in response to yesterday's extension by by

the amount incurred in the defence of Ryanair's previous unsolicited offer in 2006, Aer Lingus regrets this 
unnecessary waste of shareholders' cash especially as the Ryanair offer is not capable of completion', it said in a

Aer Lingus expects to make a profit for 2008, despite an operating loss of around 20m euro for the year.

Body
Ryanair has called for an extraordinary meeting of Aer Lingus shareholders aimed at blocking recent changes 
agreed by Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus chief executive, in his employment contract, writes Kevin Done.
Ryanair, which is pursuing a hostile takeover bid for its smaller Irish rival, said Mr Mannion's employment contract 
had been amended earlier this year.
Under the changes he would be entitled to claim up to EUR2.8m (£2.5m) should be decide to resign following a 
change of control in the company.
That claim could be made even if new owners were happy for him to continue in office, as Ryanair said would be 
the case if its bid was successful.
Ryanair said it had extended its EUR1.40 a share takeover offer to February 13. It had received only a tiny number 
of acceptances by Monday's first deadline, with only 0.1 per cent of shareholders backing the offer in addition to 
Ryanair itself, which already holds a stake of 29.82 per cent.
Analysts said that they expected Ryanair would now be forced to raise its bid.

Ryanair, as a major shareholder, has requisitioned an Extraordinary General Meeting at Aer Lingus over revelations 
about Aer Lingus chief, Dermot Mannion's 'Golden Parachute' allowance.
"As a 29.82pc shareholder in Aer Lingus Group, we are deeply concerned by the reported amendments to Mr 
Mannion's employment agreement summarised on page 37 of Aer Lingus' 22 December defence document," 
Ryanair said.
"We note from the version of Mr Mannion's amendment letter made available to us on 5 January, 2009, and which

to resign following a change of control of the Company, even if the new owners (as is the case with Ryanair) are 
happy for him to continue in office. This "failure bonus" appears to us to be both excessive and indefensible," it 
added.
"We believe that such arrangements - where multi-million euro sums are paid to Aer Lingus management at their 
choosing where they voluntarily decide to resign - are not only unprecedented, but are also in breach of both Irish 
Takeover Rules (Rule 21) and Irish company law (s186 and s188 of the Companies Act, 1963), unless they have 
been approved in advance by the Company's shareholders in general meeting."

Aer Lingus shareholders snub Ryanair takeover bid

Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC revealed Tuesday it has attracted little interest from Aer Lingus shareholders for its proposed 
takeover of the rival Irish carrier and extended its offer period for acceptance.
Ryanair, which already owns 29.82 percent of Aer Lingus, said that as of Monday the original closing time for the 
offer it had secured acceptances for only an additional 22,300 shares, or less than 0.01 percent of Aer Lingus' total 
share capital.
Ryanair said it was pushing back the deadline for shareholders to accept the offer to Feb. 13.
The poor takeup followed an appeal from Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington for investors to snub the offer.
Barrington branded the Ryanair bid of €1.40 ($1.95) a share an opportunistic "rip-off." That price is around half the 
value of a previous failed takeover attempt in October 2006, an approach that was opposed by major Aer Lingus 
shareholders, including the Irish government, company employees and pilots.
The European Commission ruled in June 2007 that a Ryanair-Aer Lingus combination would create an illegal 
monopoly. Ryanair is appealing that verdict, citing EU clearance for other European airline mergers.

British Airways reported a 3% year on year decline in passenger traffic in December, but the airline said it remained 
confident it could meet profit forecasts.
Europe's third-largest airline said traffic - defined as the number of passengers multiplied by the distance flown - 
had fallen by 3.4% in total in December 2008 compared to the previous year, representing its tenth consecutive 
monthly fall.
In terms of numbers of passengers, 2.51 million people flew with British Airways in December, down from the 2.63 
million reported in December 2007.
However, despite the global economic slowdown, the company said it remained confident it could meet previous 
targets.
It said: 'Trading conditions remain broadly unchanged, with longhaul premium traffic continuing the trend of recent 
months and non-premium traffic showing some resilience, helped by travel over the Christmas period. Financial 
guidance for the year remains unchanged.'
BA said there had been a 12.1% fall in premium traffic, alongside a 1.7% fall in non-premium traffic, as consumers 
shun more expensive flights for cheaper options.
Rival Ryanair, the Dublin-listed group, said its passenger numbers had climbed to 4.37 million in December, up 
11% the previous year.
Ryanair's average load factor - the proportion of seats taken up by passengers on each flights - was flat at 79%, 
while BA's dipped 0.2% to 76.7%.
Shares in British Airways fell 1.6% initially, before recovering to sit up 0.7% or 1.2p, at 183.5p. Meanwhile, Ryanair 
climbed 0.9% before shares dropped back 0.6% to sit at 3.2.

Ryanair has hit out at a 2.8m euro golden parachute reportedly agreed by Aer Lingus for its chief executive Dermot 
Mannion should a takeover of the airline take place.
In a statement, the low cost carrier, which is also a major shareholder in the formerly state-owned airline, called on 
the Aer Lingus board to explain what it called the "indefensible and unprecedented failure bonus".
The bonus was reported yesterday by the Sunday Independent.
It was not,said the Ryanair statement "compensation for loss of office, but rather a spectacular secret bonus, which 
can be triggered by Dermot Mannion himself should he choose to resign immediately following a change of control 
of Aer Lingus". The statement added:"Ryanair believes that this secret failure bonus' should be put to all 
shareholders for approval at Aer Lingus' next AGM, which will allow all shareholders (including Government, ESOT, 
Tailwinds and Ryanair) to consider whether Mr. Mannion, who has delivered substantial operating losses in two of 
the last three years (2006 and 2008),should be able to trigger such an excessively generous bonus." Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary said the bonus showed that Dermot Mannion had no faith in Aer Lingus' future as an 
independent airline. "If Dermot Mannion and the Aer Lingus Board really believed that Aer Lingus has an 
'independent' future, then they wouldn't be secretly stuffing 2.8 million euro of shareholders cash into Dermot 
Mannion's resignation lifeboat," he said.

The outlook for the Irish economy in 2009 is bleak but strong Irish companies with robust balance sheets will still

The broker expects GDP to fall by more than 4pc with unemployment likely to exceed 10pc but that Government

Ireland should still be very relevant to investors given the world-class nature of a number of Irish companies

Balance sheet strength will also remain key. Many of these world-class companies have among the strongest 
balance sheets in their sectors globally, it said. The report added that earnings stability is another virtue that is likely 
to be recognised by investors in 2009. A number of Irish stocks provide this stability. However, the financial sector, 
uncertainty remains until recapitalisation is completed but Irish Life and Permanent provides "an interesting 
investment opportunity". "Combining the criteria above, we derive our top picks for 2009: CRH, Kerry, Irish Life and

ILFC: AIG's sale of the century
ILFC: AIG's sale of the century
AirFinance Journal
January 2009

Section: COVER STORY
Length: 2283 words
Highlight: The sale of ILFC by AIG may seem unthinkable but there are extraordinary parallels with GPA. It looks 
likely that a private equity firm will buy ILFC. If the sale is unsuccessful it could be the worst thing ever to hit aviation 
finance.
Body
September 1993: General Electric acquires GPA, saving the Irish leasing company, then the world's largest aircraft 
lessor, from collapse.
September 2008: American International Group collapses and the future of International Lease Finance Corp, now 
one of the world's largest lessors, is suddenly in doubt. A buyer is urgently needed.
The coincidence is remarkable. ILFC and GPA both suffered because of equity markets: ILFC because of a run on 
its owner AIG; in GPA's case through a failed initial public offering.
Although each firm employed some of the best people in the industry, each has been defined by one individual. 
Steve Udvar-Hazy, who arguably invented aircraft leasing, is the face of ILFC. The late Dr Tony Ryan, who also 
founded Irish low cost carrier Ryanair, epitomised GPA.
With hindsight, it is easy to see why GPA's IPO failed, yet at the time it was a huge shock to everyone, including 
many employees who had bought stock. Similarly, at the beginning of 2008 no one expected AIG to crumble.
In uncertain markets investors always look to history for guidance and GE's acquisition of GPA is particularly 
relevant. GE used GPA - renamed GE Capital Aviation Services - to become one of the world's two largest aircraft 
leasing companies. There is no reason why the right buyer for ILFC could not allow the lessor to keep growing.
In the toughest financial market for years it may seem surprising that anyone is bidding for ILFC. However, the sale 
offers buyers the chance to acquire the number one or number two company - depending on how you value it - in 
the aircraft leasing market. ILFC has a strong, modern portfolio and is regarded as one of the best managers of 
aircraft.
If a buyer is not found and ILFC is forced to sell large amounts of aircraft at low prices it will lower aircraft values 
and hit every aircraft owner and financier hard. At the end of September ILFC owned 950 aeroplanes and managed 
another 99.
ILFC: AIG's sale of the century
"If the team walk away there is no way that another lessor could take over servicing the portfolio. No one has the 
capacity to simply add another 1,000 aircraft without buying a whole platform," says one leasing company CEO.
First bids in, when is the second round?
"Right now we are deeply involved in the process of separating ILFC and AIG, and restructuring with potential new 
equity investors, including management," said Hazy, in an email to Airfinance Journal. "The goal is to have ILFC 
emerge from this AIG crisis as a strong, standalone, well financed aircraft leasing company, with global leadership 
in the operating lease sector."
As you read this, somewhere in the world an analyst at a private equity firm is analysing ILFC's portfolio or 
desperately working out whether the fund can raise enough debt to finance a deal.
First round bids were submitted in the middle of December 2008 and everyone is waiting for the shortlist to be 
revealed.
Blackstone Group is advising AIG on the sale, while Morgan Stanley is representing the US government. ILFC's 
management team has chosen boutique investment bank Moelis & Co, founded by Ken Moelis, a former UBS 
investment banking president.
"No one is really sure what is going on. Everyone is calling up, saying 'we are the main advisers on the deal'," says 
one banker. "There are a lot of alpha males involved."
Bidders were instructed to submit single offers and not form bidding groups, but it looks likely that ILFC will 
eventually be sold to a group of investors.
"There will definitely be one decent consortium by the end of the second round," says one banker. "They should get 
someone to write a clear cheque for the equity. It may not be 100% of book value - about $7.5 billion - but it will still 
help the federal government out."
The biggest problem is that so many questions remain. "There are risks that require the seller's support," says one 
banker. "What is the US government's interest in a halfway solution, where it would provide some support? Do you 
need to buy the whole thing or can you split it up?"
Despite these questions, the first round is likely to attract private equity firms to bid for the lessor. "Our aim is to get 
through the first round so we are around to team up with someone else," says one private equity bidder.
ILFC's aircraft orders - thanks for the delays
As if finding $7.5 billion to buy the equity was not enough, buyers will have to meet the lessor's debts and 
obligations to buy aircraft over the coming years.
AIG's ownership allowed ILFC to be the largest customer of both Airbus and Boeing. In 2009 alone, it is due to take 
delivery of 43 aircraft.
In September, when AIG had collapsed, the lessor had signed contracts for 174 new aircraft, worth $16.9 billion, 
due to be delivered before 2019. About 13 aircraft were due to be delivered by the end of 2008, although this 
included five planes that were delayed by the strike at Boeing.
If ILFC is unable to honour these orders - and it is worth stressing that few people think a default on the orders is 
likely - it will be a far bigger problem in 2009 for Airbus than Boeing.
The European manufacturer is due to deliver 28 aircraft of the A320 family in 2009 and five A330s, compared to just 
six 737s and four 777s.
ILFC: AIG's sale of the century
Boeing's delays with the 787 programme will help ILFC. Some 74 of the 174 aircraft on order are 787s, due for 
delivery between January 2010 and December 2017. The manufacturer has told ILFC that these deliveries will be 
delayed by an average of more than two years.
ILFC will have a breather in 2010, with just five aircraft due for delivery.
Speculative aircraft orders have always complicated the sales of aircraft leasing companies. When WestLB sold 
Boullioun in 2002 the issue was price escalation: aircraft were costing more when they were delivered than the 
market price.
This is not an issue with ILFC. In 2003 John Plueger, the company's COO, told Airfinance Journal that ILFC refused 
to sign high escalation rates when ordering aircraft.
In fact, ILFC's orderbook could be viewed as a strength. Although market values for aircraft are falling, it is widely 
accepted by the lessor's competitors that apart from airlines no one gets to pay as little for new aircraft as Hazy. So 
even if values fall, ILFC's deliveries could still be below market prices. There is also strong demand for 787s.
The real challenge for ILFC and its new owner will be to find enough cash to finance the deliveries and pay off 
existing debt. 
 Funding ILFC - bonds and commercial paperAs a double-A rated subsidiary of a triple-A rated parent, ILFC could 
raise debt more cheaply than all of its competitors apart from Gecas. This was one of its biggest strengths, allowing 
it to place large orders.Leaving aside internal loans from AIG, ILFC borrowed in five ways: issuing bonds and 
medium term notes; using export credit guaranteed loans secured on aircraft; unsecured bank debt; and 
commercial paper.Pretty much all these options, except limited commercial paper and export credit loans, are now 
closed. A significant amount of debt is due to be repaid in the next 12 months.The most pressing worry is the 
lessor's commercial paper. ILFC has always been a regular issuer of commercial paper, with a $6 billion 
programme, but this market was closed to the lessor as soon as AIG was downgraded.In September ILFC was 
forced to borrow $1.67 billion from its owner to allow it to pay off maturing commercial paper. It later repaid this by 
fully drawing down a revolving credit facility.Since then ILFC has taken advantage of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York's commercial paper guarantee facility and issued $1.7 billion. It is approved to issue another $4 billion 
before the programme expires on April 30 2009, but it is not clear if ILFC will tap this market.In the bond and MTN 
markets, ILFC had $21 billion of paper outstanding in September 2008.In theory, it has another $900 million 
available under its shelf registration and $900 million under its MTN programme. In reality, banks think ILFC is 
unlikely to be able to tap the bond market."It is amazing," says one banker. "ILFC is a single-A credit that could not 
raise one dime in the bond market because of the uncertainty about its parent."In the past, when ILFC issued 
bonds, underwriters were typically able to build strong books, with a range of top Asian and insurance investors. 
Now many of these bonds are held by hedge funds and other distressed debt investors, taking a view on the 
lessor's long term prospects. 
 Banks hold the key
ILFC was able to use its financial strength to arrange three unsecured revolving credit facilities with 35 banks, worth 
$6.5 billion in total. The revolvers gave it far more flexibility than other lessors were able to find.
"ILFC built a world class syndicate," says one banker, "using a mixture of AIG and ILFC relationships."
However, the debt will need to be refinanced in due course, and even before that ILFC's new owner will have to 
persuade the banks to accept the change of ownership.
The first $2 billion of the bank debt expires in October 2009, with the rest due in 2010 and 2011. The lessor sensibly 
drew down the full remaining amount on September 18, to allow it to repay commercial paper and other debts.
ILFC says that drawdown will allow it to meet all its debt payments in the first quarter of 2009.
ILFC: AIG's sale of the century
"ILFC has been clever to make sure that banks have not been able to move out of the syndicate," says one banker. 
"It means that they have room for negotiation."
This is a huge advantage. All too often in aviation finance, airlines fail to lock in their lending syndicates, meaning 
that debt gets transferred to hedge funds and other players that may be much less willing to cooperate with the 
borrower and other lenders if a restructuring becomes necessary.
While it looks unlikely that many of the banks will be prepared to refinance the facility on the existing terms in 
October 2009, whoever buys ILFC should be able to negotiate and could persuade the banks to come in by turning 
it into a secured facility.
"I would be happy if ILFC used unencumbered aircraft as a pledge for the facility," says one European banker. 
"They could effectively turn it from an unsecured facility to a secured one. We would be delighted to do this. But 
most of the banks in the facility are not aviation banks, however, so may prefer government support."
The bank syndicate also controls what financing options are available as there is a negative pledge clause 
restricting ILFC from using more than 12.5%, roughly $4 billion, of its assets as security. However, a buyer could 
raise cash by securitising aircraft through a special purpose vehicle, although this market is effectively closed at the 
moment.
Will export credit agencies fill the gap?
In 1999 ILFC signed the world's biggest ever commercial aircraft finance deal with a $4.3 billion European export 
credit facility - although it only used $3 billion in the end. The lessor still owns some aircraft funded through this.
The European export credit agencies agreed to another facility in 2004. In October they asked ILFC to preserve 
separately the security deposits and maintenance reserves for all the aircraft in the 2004 facility. ILFC is believed to 
have made other arrangements with aircraft financed from the first deal.
The agencies' request should not be viewed too negatively. Lessors typically have to do this on all deals and the 
fact that banks and export credit agencies had not requested it when the deal was originally signed merely reflects 
how strong ILFC was seen to be.
The lessor states that it has $900 million of export credit guarantees available to fund its Airbus deliveries - 
however, the agencies are not obliged to provide these guarantees.
"ILFC has a letter from a bank guaranteeing a portion of deliveries. It does not have a guarantee from us and we 
will always view each aircraft on a case-by-case basis," says one export credit agency. ILFC may also be able to 
use US Ex-Im to finance Boeing deliveries. A senior manager at an export credit agency says the agency has been 
disappointed with the amount of effort ILFC has put in to explaining its situation.
However, the official said the agencies would support a new owner. "Why would we not support the sale, given the 
toxic state that it is in now?" says the official.
Rival lessors could help out
ILFC's business model relied on selling on aircraft after owning them for a few years and several lessors have 
approached ILFC about buying aircraft.
Companies like Aviation Capital Group, AWAS, BOC Aviation and new Chinese lessors could in theory each buy 
sizeable portfolios and help make bids accessible.
"When you are talking about $50 billion you need to tap every market," says one banker. "Although I would love to 
see the bid/ask spread in a negotiation between Hazy and Guy Hands [CEO of Terra Firma, parent of Awas]."
ILFC: AIG's sale of the century
The Chinese government is restricting overseas investments by Chinese banks, but they could buy aircraft that 
were already leased to domestic carriers. Middle Eastern institutions might also be interested in buying assets. 
While it may be of little comfort to ILFC's management, the fact that a sale is possible in these markets is a 
testament to the company's strength.
"If anyone can be successful at buying out ILFC it is Steve," says Stephen Hannahs, CEO and group managing 
director at Aviation Capital Group, the operating lessor owned by insurer Pacific Life. "If anyone can do it he will."
While GPA is a valuable case study for the air finance industry, the sale of ILFC truly will be an exceptional deal. 
GPA ran into trouble because of its $350 million failed IPO and was bailed out with a $1.5 billion loan from GE. If 
ILFC is sold it will truly be the sale of this century.

Public 'against' Aer Lingus takeover

Section: IRELAND
Length: 249 words

Two-thirds of the Irish public are against the proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair, according to a survey 
commissioned by the former state airline.
The survey of more than 1,000 people by research firm TNS-MRBI found that only one in four people were in favour 
of the proposed takeover.
Aer Lingus management last week formally rejected a  748 million bid by Ryanair, which already owns 29 per cent 
of the airline. The government has a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
When asked if a Ryanair monopoly would be good for consumers,65 per cent of those surveyed said it would not be 
a positive move. Almost half believed a Ryanair monopoly would result in increased fares and just 15 per cent 
believed that fares would decrease.
Just over half of those surveyed said they did not believe that Ryanair would honour commitments they made in 
relation to price reductions, job creation and protecting the Aer Lingus brand if its bid was successful.
Enda Corneille, director of corporate affairs at Aer Lingus said the survey ''emphasises the need for consumer 
choice for air travel out of Ireland''.
The TNS-MRBI survey was conducted by telephone among 1,015 Irish adults between December 11and 16.
A Ryanair spokeswoman said a survey of 1,015 people was ''not in any way reflective'' of public opinion.
''Aer Lingus must be delighted to fritter away valuable resources on useless surveys, instead of addressing the real 
issue of importance which is the value and interests of Aer Lingus shareholder."

Barrington claims Ryanair chairman is linked to fund with 2% stake in Aer Lingus

Body
Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus, said he believes an investment fund linked to Texas Pacific Group, the 
investment vehicle of David Bonderman, chairman of Ryanair, has bought a 2 per cent stake in the former state 
airline.
Barrington made a reference to the fund while giving evidence at an Oireachtas committee hearing earlier this 
month.
The Aer Lingus chairman did not name the fund but said that its representatives had stated publicly that ''we should 
consider the offer [from Ryanair]". Last week, Aer Lingus published its defence document to the EUR 1.40 per 
share offer for the company from Ryanair.
The former state company said it would recommence flights from Shannon to Heathrow from March 29, 2009 and 
said the EUR 748million value of Aer Lingus from the Ryanair offer seriously ''misrepresents the significant progress 
of Aer Lingus since its flotation in 2006 and seeks to underline its vibrant future as an independent airline''.
Barrington said Aer Lingus had a strong balance sheet with total cash reserves of EUR 1.3 billion and net cash of 
EUR 803 million.
He added that Ryanair wanted to pay other shareholders EUR 525milliontoget control of Aer Lingus in order to gain 
access to this EUR 1.3 billion cash balance. Ryanair already owns 29 per cent of the company, with the state 
owning a further 25 per cent.
Ryanair has said that the deal would create a strong Irish airline and would lead to the creation of 1,000 new jobs. 
Last week, Aer Lingus shares were trading at EUR 1.53.

Aer Lingus has hit back at its rival Ryanair's EUR1.40-a-share hostile bid, saying it was "a rip-off". Aer Lingus said it 
would make a small pre-tax profit in 2008 and 2009 and insisted it had a "vibrant independent future".
In a letter to shareholders, Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus, showed he could be as outspoken as Michael 
O'Leary, chief executive of the rival Irish carrier.
Mr Barrington accused Ryanair of "threats, contradictions and insinuations", saying a takeover would create a 
monopoly in the Irish Republic, which would "flatter to deceive and give meaningless guarantees".
In the letter, Mr Barrington asserted that in spite of difficult trading conditions, "we expect to achieve profit overall in 
2008".
Last month the group said it would make a EUR20m (£18.8m) operating loss in 2008, but yesterday the group said 
that with interest income on its cash it should generate a profit before tax and the exceptional costs of a large 
restructuring plan.
It had previously predicted further 2009 operating losses.
However, it has since agreed a deal with its unions on cost cuts designed to save EUR50m a year and benefited 
from falling fuel prices.
Mr Barrington said that the group would "continue to enhance profitability in 2009 and beyond".
Aer Lingus had proved it could compete both with major flag carriers and low-cost operators such as Ryan-air, he 
said. Ryanair, by contrast, had no experience of managing a long-haul business such as Aer Lingus's transatlantic 
routes, or offering superior customer service.
Mr Barrington said that while Aer Lingus had net cash of EUR803m, it would cost Ryanair only EUR525m to buy the 
70.2 per cent of Aer Lingus shares it does not already own.
Chairman of Aer Lingus hits out at Ryanair
Mr Barrington said in the letter "for this reason alone, the offer is worthy of rejection".
He said on top of the cash, Aer Lingus's aircraft, the value of its slots at Heathrow, its market position and brand all 
added to the group's value.
As well as launching the defence document, Aer Lingus said it was re-opening its route between Shannon, in the 
west of Ireland, and London's Heathrow , which it axed last year causing a political furore.
Ryanair had said that if its bid was successful it would re-open the route.
In response to Mr Barrington's letter yesterday, Mr O'Leary claimed "Aer Lingus has incurred substantial - as yet 
undisclosed - exceptional costs, and companies have to pay tax, so the result will be another year of substantial net 
losses."
Aer Lingus shares yesterday rose 6 cents to close at EUR1.50. Ryanair shares were up 3.7 cents to EUR3.09.

British consumer publication, Which? has warned passengers they face paying through the nose for food and drink 
with "no frills" airlines - especially Ryanair.
While Ryanair may charge next to nothing for some flights, on board, a small bottle of fizzy water costs £2.50, while 
a sandwich costs £4.20, the most expensive of all the airlines surveyed.
The Irish airline was found to be the most expensive for snacks in a survey of five carriers by Which? Holiday 
magazine. The two items, along with a mini-tub of Pringles, a coffee and a quarter bottle of red wine, would set 
passengers back £16.05. This was found to be half the price of a flight between Stansted and Girona, Italy, last 
month.
By comparison, Bmibaby was rated cheapest, with the same meal costing £10.50, and its fizzy water costing only 
80p. Flybe was second most expensive, at £11.95, followed by EasyJet at £11.50 and Monarch at £10.60. Which? 
Holiday advised passengers to buy food and drink before boarding, or bring their own. It said they could also check 
prices in airlines' inflight magazines, most of which were available online.

Aer Lingus tells shareholders to snub Ryanair
Aer Lingus tells shareholders to snub Ryanair
Associated Press Financial Wire

Body
Aer Lingus appealed Monday to shareholders to snub Ryanair's takeover bid, calling the move by its Irish rival a 
deceitful rip-off.
Chairman Colm Barrington formally asked shareholders to ignore Ryanair letters seeking their stock for €1.40 
($1.95) a share.
"Do not let this rip-off happen," he wrote in a letter to shareholders.
Aer Lingus' No. 1 shareholder Ryanair declined to comment. Its Dec. 1 bid was 25 percent higher than the Aer 
Lingus share price at the time. Aer Lingus stock rapidly rose and has remained above Ryanair's bid price on 
expectations of an improved offer.
In his letter, Barrington noted that Ryanair was bidding €525 million to acquire an airline with net cash exceeding 
€800 million, a fleet worth €600 million, and industry-coveted Heathrow slots.
He said Ryanair was "opportunistically attempting to capitalize on current market fears and uncertainties to profit 
from our proven business model and gain access to our huge cash resources and valuable assets."
Barrington's stern defense boosted Aer Lingus shares, which rose 2.8 percent to €1.48, while Ryanair fell 3.2 
percent to €3.00.
In a move related to the takeover offer, Aer Lingus announced Monday it will reopen services between western 
Ireland's main airport, Shannon, and London's Heathrow Airport in March 2009 following a 14-month break.
That reversed Aer Lingus' most unpopular decision since the airline went private in 2006 and undercuts part of 
Ryanair's takeover sales pitch.
Aer Lingus had angered the government, labor unions, and much of the Irish nation when it pulled Heathrow 
services out of Shannon in favor of a new hub in the British territory of Northern Ireland.
Aer Lingus tells shareholders to snub Ryanair
At the time Aer Lingus justified the divisive move because it saw better profits at Belfast International Airport, citing 
a bigger market and cheaper, more flexible workers. Ryanair promised to reopen the Shannon-Heathrow route if 
stock-holding Aer Lingus workers backed its bid.
Aer Lingus said Monday it could afford to resume the Shannon link with Heathrow because the two main labor 
unions agreed in recent weeks to a package of cutbacks and reforms designed to bring its wage bill closer to 
Ryanair's.
The moves come after Aer Lingus last week ended its fuel surcharges on trans-Atlantic routes a direct response to 
Ryanair's promise to do so if the takeover were to go ahead.
Ryanair has acquired 29.8 percent of Aer Lingus shares since launching its hostile bid in October 2006 at €2.80 a 
share double its current offer. The other two major shareholders, the Irish government and Aer Lingus employee-
controlled trusts, oppose Ryanair.
The European Commission ruled in June 2007 that a Ryanair-Aer Lingus combination would create an illegal 
monopoly. Ryanair is appealing that verdict, citing EU clearance for other European airline mergers.

In a formal response document to Ryanair's hostile bid for Aer Lingus, the former State airline rejected the takeover 
bid, saying it significantly undervalues Aer Lingus.
The airline's directors today unanimously recommended that Aer Lingus shareholders take no action in relation to 
the offer.
The document said that Aer Lingus is a profitable business, has a clear strategy for growth, has "unmatched" 
financial strength, has delivered on its promises and simply does not need Ryanair.
Aer Lingus Chairman, Colm Barrington has written to all shareholders saying that the E1.40 a share offer also 
misrepresents the significant progress of Aer Lingus since the IPO in 2006 and seeks to undermine Aer Lingus' 
vibrant future as an independent airline. "I would like to highlight the recent agreements with SIPTU and IMPACT as 
a defining moment for Aer Lingus - our employees have cooperatively agreed significant changes in work practices 
and reductions in costs which will allow the airline to grow further and will underpin both employment and 
profitability in the future. As a first step we have recommenced operations between Shannon and Heathrow which 
along with our other London routes will provide an important level of business connectivity between London and the 
west of Ireland," he said. Aer Lingus has a strong balance sheet - one of the strongest in the industry - with total 
cash reserves of E1.3 billion and net cash of E803 million, he reminded shareholders. "Aer Lingus has proven that it 
can compete with major flag carriers on the one hand and low cost operators on the other. This is not a model to be 
sacrificed for the benefit of Ryanair and its shareholders," he said.

Aer Lingus plans vigorous defence against Ryanair bid

Aer Lingus will reject the  748 million takeover bid from Ryanair this week with a defence document showing it 
expects to make a small profit in 2009.
That would represent a major turnaround from predicted losses of up to  100 million before Aer Lingus agreed a 
controversial cost-cutting plan with staff. The airline's defence document, to be launched in Dublin and London, will 
formally reject the Ryanair offer and defend its commercial viability following the major cost efficiency drive.
Aer Lingus will counter claims from Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, that the only option for an airline of 
its size is to merge or risk being taken over by a larger player. Sources said the Aer Lingus document was likely to 
point to the success of its cost savings at Dublin and Shannon airports at a time when most airlines are predicting 
losses for 2009.
Aer Lingus will also announce plans to reinstate the Shannon-Heathrow route in a bid to counter a guarantee from 
O'Leary that the Oireachtas could control the Heathrow slots if the takeover by Ryanair went ahead.
Last Friday, Aer Lingus announced plans to invest about £120 million in opening a base at London Gatwick with 
short-haul routes. It will also re-establish a service in April next year at Knock Airport, where Ryanair has recently 
enhanced services.
Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus, last week told an Oireachtas committee that more than 30 airlines of 
similar size to Aer Lingus were operating successfully across Europe. ''While there have been some casualties in 
2008, mainly as a result of high fuel prices, they have tended to be smaller niche carriers that were thinly 
capitalised," Barrington said.
''Carriers like Aer Lingus, which has  1.3 billion in cash, have not been affected in such a manner this year because 
they can survive any downturn."
Aer Lingus plans vigorous defence against Ryanair bid
Barrington said it would be ''an appalling vista for the population of Ireland'' if Ryanair - which has negotiated airport 
deals across Europe - was to become the only customer of Ireland's airports.

Ryanair's  748 million offer for Aer Lingus could boost its profits by more than  200 million in what is known as a 
'bargain purchase' under accounting rules, a leading accountant has claimed.
The accountant, who did not wish to be named, is an expert on accounting standards, and not connected to either 
Aer Lingus or to Ryanair. He said the sum of all Aer Lingus's aircraft, buildings and other assets less all of their 
borrowings at June 30,2008 were valued on their interim financial statements at  916 million.
''This would not include any value attaching to certain intangible assets such as landing slots, brand names and 
customer lists. Should Ryanair acquire Aer Lingus for the current amount being offered,  748 million, it is likely to 
give rise to what accounting rules call a 'bargain purchase'. The gain from this bargain purchase is recognised in 
Ryanair's income statement at the date that the purchase is made. In effect, the purchase would give a once-off 
boost, of probably in excess of  200 million, to Ryanair's profits for the year," he said.
The claim suggests the Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus undervalues the airline and that shareholders should, at the very 
least, wait for a better offer to be tabled.
However, other sources suggested the accountant had not factored in the cost of restructuring Aer Lingus, which 
would lead to an exceptional charge of  100 million, adjustments relating to pension fund deficits at Aer Lingus, and 
a number of other technical factors which would result in extra costs.

Bid target seeks to assert independence
Deal with BA on airport slots
Body
Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier fighting a hostile takeover bid by Ryanair, is launching its first base outside the Irish 
Republic and Northern Ireland at London's Gatwick airport.
The move into Gatwick is a strategic gamble by the group, which is seeking to demonstrate it can survive and 
expand as an independent carrier without taking part in the wave of consolidation in European aviation.
It is also taking advantage of retrenchments at the UK's second-largest airport by British Airways, which is 
consolidating its operations at Heathrow, its global hub, and is shrinking at Gatwick.
Aer Lingus has reached a deal with BA to utilise some of the take-off and landing slots BA no longer needs. It has 
also picked up others from the small pool of free slots, which has been increased by the collapse of carriers 
previously flying to the airport, such as XL Airways, Zoom Airlines and Sterling Airlines.
BA has announced it is withdrawing four aircraft from Gatwick in the next summer season - three short-haul and 
one long-haul - cutting its departures by about 15 per cent.
Between the summer seasons of 2001 and 2009, BA will have cut its number of take-off and landing slots at 
Gatwick by 45 per cent.
Its share of slots at the airport has dropped from 40 per cent in 2001 to 20 per cent, as other carriers have taken 
advantage of its retrenchment, led by EasyJet, which controls 26 per cent of the Gatwick slots and has established 
its biggest base in Europe at the airport.
Flybe, European's leading regional airline in which BA holds a 15 per cent stake, is also growing and has gained a 
9 per cent share of the Gatwick slots.
Aer Lingus to set up base at Gatwick
Aer Lingus, which opened its first base outside the Irish Republic at Belfast early this year, said it would launch the 
Gatwick base in April with routes to Zurich, Munich, Vienna, Malaga, Faro, Nice and Knock in addition to the 
existing Gatwick/Dublin service.
Dermot Mannion, chief executive, said the group planned to base four Airbus A320 short-haul jets at Gatwick from 
April next year and would double the fleet to eight from summer 2010.
Mr Mannion said the Gatwick base offered Aer Lingus a "unique opportunity to establish a significant foothold in 
one of the biggest aviation markets in the world".
The move by Aer Lingus into Gatwick provides support for BAA, the owner, which is seeking to sell the airport and 
has lost several carriers through bankruptcies and the transfer of flights to Heathrow.
Aer Lingus is expected to issue its defence document against the hostile Ryanair takeover bid next week.
Aer Lingus shares closed up slightly at EUR1.44.

Body
Ryanair has, as a major shareholder in Aer Lingus, called for clarity from the former State airline, questioning its 
revenue and profits forecasts and calling for the full impact of the costs surrounding its defence of Ryanair's hostile 
bid to be made known.
In a series of questions to Aer Lingus management, Ryanair also asked how much cash compensation and 
exceptional costs have been, or will be, incurred to deliver the recently announced cost-cutting deal with the unions 
and asked that for a definitive figure on the extent of the deficit in the Aer Lingus defined benefit pension schemes.
"Since Aer Lingus Group plc has previously forecast an operating loss of approx. E20m in 2008 (11 Nov interim 
statement) and another operating loss of approx. E70m in 2009 (investor conference call 28th Aug 2008), can the 
company, in light of the above substantial cost increases and revenue reductions, please confirm its forecast post 
exceptional net profit (loss) after tax for both 2008 and 2009?" the open letter asked.
"During the course of Aer Lingus' most recent investor conference call (28th Aug 2008), the company forecast that 
its net cash balance would decline to "about E550m" by the end of 2009. In light of the impact of: (i) the substantial 
cost increases outlined above, (ii) the loss of revenue arising from the elimination of fuel surcharges, (iii) the impact 
of the company's current fuel hedges, (iv) the compensation cost for the recent "transformational deal", and (v) the 
company's expected defence fees, can the company please confirm for all shareholders its revised forecast net 
cash balances at year end 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009." "Like all other investors in Aer Lingus 
Group plc, we would appreciate a detailed clarification of the above issues and their impact on forecast post 
exceptional net profit (loss) after tax in 2008 and again in 2009, for all shareholders, in your forthcoming defence 
document. As I'm sure you will appreciate, the above issues will be of utmost importance to all stakeholders in 
maximising shareholder value in Aer Lingus Group plc."

British Airways may be the world's "favourite airline". But it is certainly not the world's biggest. That is the main 
reason why its merger talks with Qantas collapsed. Yes, the technical complications of an Anglo-antipodean tie-up 
would have been horrendous. But complexity alone did not break the deal. Rather it was an old-fashioned mergers 
and acquisitions struggle. The Australian airline sought majority ownership. It also wanted the executive board to sit 
in Sydney. BA said no. End of deal.
So it is back to the drawing board for global airline consolidation, for now. Qantas may pursue Asian deals from 
home. Meanwhile Willie Walsh, BA's chief executive, has a wide array of options sketched out on his own office 
jotter pad. There is still the possibility of an Iberia deal, a combination with American Airlines some day, perhaps a 
white knight rescue of Aer Lingus (Walsh's former posting) from Ryanair, even a strategic stake in Alitalia. Yet this 
hodgepodge of Venn diagrams is as much a vision of Mr Walsh's overactive mind as of how busy the airline world 
has become.
BA sits in the middle of an industry consolidating into a vicious downturn. Regulators are allowing deals they would 
never have countenanced before. None of these deals are mutually exclusive. All are potentially value-creating. As 
one sign of that, since the BA/Qantas talks went public, their share prices, and Iberia's too, have outperformed the 
sector. The main question is how the combinations are sequenced.
Regional consolidation - as Iberia fumed when BA and Qantas first announced they were in talks - is the logical first 
step. It is the path of least geographical and regulatory resistance; Lufthansa and Air France-KLM have already 
cleared the way. It also offers the most value. Synergies from a BA/Iberia merger could total £400m a year. That is 
more than twice that available from a Qantas deal, estimates Collins Stewart. Looked at another way, taxed and 
capitalised, it is equivalent to £2.8bn, or three quarters of the two groups' combined market capitalisation. Focus, 
Willie, focus!

Aer Lingus is planning to open a base at Gatwick Airport in London next spring to offer short-haul flights to 
continental Europe, according to a report this morning.
It would be the airline's second base outside the Republic, after Belfast which it opened last year.
The Irish Times says the airline will announce the move in the coming days, possibly at a joint press briefing in 
Dublin and London early next week to launch its defence document to Ryanair's latest takeover bid.
The paper says Aer Lingus is also expected to restore the Shannon-to-Heathrow link that it scrapped a year ago. It 
says that the airline will base three aircraft at Gatwick and will initially operate short-haul routes to seven 
destinations in Europe, including Malaga, Munich and Zurich. It also reports that the airline is believed to be looking 
at offering transatlantic flights from Gatwick.

Chambers Ireland's Air Transport Users Council (ATUC) today said that Ryanair's revised bid for Aer Lingus should 
not be approved in the interest of competition.
"While both Ryanair and Aer Lingus have solid records of reducing ticket prices, as a merged entity this history 
could be threatened," it said.
Speaking ahead of the Airlines' presentation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Chambers Ireland's 
ATUC Spokesperson, Sean Murphy said, "If the merger were approved it gives rise to a potential monopsony 
(where the merged airline would become a de facto monopoly purchaser of services) being created at the 
Republic's key airports. Ireland's position as an island economy is critical. Connectivity is key and, in the case of 
many business passengers, interlining. There is no guarantee that this would remain a priority if the bid succeeds," 
Murphy said.
"At the time of the Aer Lingus flotation, ATUC noted the cost challenges that Aer Lingus faced. This now appears to 
be accepted by all stakeholders with recently agreed work practice changes in Aer Lingus offering the airline much 
better prospects than was the case heretofore to compete more aggressively with Ryanair and other operators," 
Murphy continued. "Aer Lingus faces significant challenges in competing against Ryanair, one of the most 
successful airlines in the world. It should be allowed to do so. However, in the event of a successful Ryanair 
takeover, then it is crucial that adequate competitive safeguards be put in place to ensure that neither monopolistic 
nor monopsonistic practices could be tolerated. Such measures would need to include enabling an operator such 
as easyJet to compete with Ryanair on the Dublin to London Heathrow routes while ensuring that these slots are 
secured for Ireland in perpetuity," he said.

Aer Lingus is not actively seeking any airline to mount a counter-bid against Ryanair's hostile offer, it said, and was 
unaware of an investor mentioned by media as a potential bidder.
Aer Lingus Chairman Colm Barrington was quoted in a newspaper interview last week as saying he would seek a 
friendly investor to take a majority stake in the airline, though Chief Executive Dermot Mannion has said Aer Lingus 
was not for sale.
"We have not been out looking for a partner, we have not approached any other airline to acquire Aer Lingus, to 
buy shares in Aer Lingus," Barrington told a Dail hearing.
The Irish Independent newspaper reported that Irish businessman Stuart Pearson is considering a bid for parts or 
all of Aer Lingus to thwart a hostile bid from rival Ryanair. "Don't know who it is, never heard of them, don't know 
anything about them," Barrington told reporters after the hearing. Ryanair officially launched its attempt to take over 
Aer Lingus on Monday by writing to its smaller rival's shareholders, asking them to accept a E750 million bid 
despite the rejection by Aer Lingus's board and management. Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary derided the 
idea of Pearson being the white knight for Aer Lingus. "I understand from this morning's paper some 24-year-old in 
(County) Wicklow may provide that friendly investor," O'Leary told the parliamentary committee. "God be, let's have 
a competition, let's compare who's got the (better) bid for the future of Aer Lingus?" Ryanair, which already owns 
almost 30 percent of Aer Lingus after a previous takeover attempt, has said other investors should vote in favour of

Aer Lingus is not actively seeking any airline to mount a counter-bid against Ryanair's hostile offer, it said, and was 
unaware of an investor mentioned by media as a potential bidder.
Aer Lingus Chairman Colm Barrington was quoted in a newspaper interview last week as saying he would seek a 
friendly investor to take a majority stake in the airline, though Chief Executive Dermot Mannion has said Aer Lingus 
was not for sale.
"We have not been out looking for a partner, we have not approached any other airline to acquire Aer Lingus, to 
buy shares in Aer Lingus," Barrington told a Dail hearing.
The Irish Independent newspaper reported that Irish businessman Stuart Pearson is considering a bid for parts or 
all of Aer Lingus to thwart a hostile bid from rival Ryanair. "Don't know who it is, never heard of them, don't know 
anything about them," Barrington told reporters after the hearing. Ryanair officially launched its attempt to take over 
Aer Lingus on Monday by writing to its smaller rival's shareholders, asking them to accept a E750 million bid 
despite the rejection by Aer Lingus's board and management. Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary derided the 
idea of Pearson being the white knight for Aer Lingus. "I understand from this morning's paper some 24-year-old in 
(County) Wicklow may provide that friendly investor," O'Leary told the parliamentary committee. "God be, let's have 
a competition, let's compare who's got the (better) bid for the future of Aer Lingus?" Ryanair, which already owns 
almost 30 percent of Aer Lingus after a previous takeover attempt, has said other investors should vote in favour of

Highlight: Brussels loses case on airport deal
Body
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, yesterday won a significant legal victory in its long-running battle with 
Brussels over airport subsidies.
The Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance, one of the top courts in Europe, upheld the airline's appeal against 
the decision in 2004 by the European Commission to block reduced airport charges and marketing support for the 
airline at Belgium's Charleroi airport.
The commission had claimed the deals constituted state aid for the Irish airline, which was incompatible with the 
common market, and requested Belgium to recover the alleged subsidies.
Ryanair called on the commission to drop similar cases against other airports used by the group including Alghero, 
Aarhus, Bratislava, Frankfurt-Hahn, Lübeck, Pau, Berlin Schönefeld and Tampere.
In annulling the commission's decision, the court said officials had failed to look at the breaks provided by the local 
Walloon region and the airport together, and apply the principle of "the private investor in a market economy" in 
assessing the measures taken to encourage Ryanair to expand its activities at Charleroi.
Instead, the commission only applied the principle to the airport itself, finding that Charleroi did take risks that a 
private investor acting in a market economy would not have taken. This approach, the court said, was flawed.
The implications of yesterday's ruling, however, quickly became a matter of fresh dispute. The airline said the 
court's decision was "a vindication of Charleroi airport's business plan, which has resulted in a thriving and 
profitable competitor to the high-cost Brussels Zaventem airport".
Ryanair said Brussels should drop the other cases and focus instead on "real and blatant breaches" of the state aid 
rules by Europe's flag carriers including "the most recent illegal bail-out" of Alitalia by the Italian government, and 
the EUR500m ($719m, £464m) state aid granted by the Austrian government to Lufthansa as a "sweetener" to 
encourage it to buy Austrian Airlines.
Ryanair wins subsidies fight
But commission officials said that, on a preliminary reading, they believed the judgment looked mainly at the 
methodology that had been used, rather than commenting on the underlying "private investor" test which lies at the 
heart of the case.
Because of the way the court reached its decision, commission officials said they believed that other disputes over 
assistance given by secondary airports to Ryanair should not be affected.

BA and Virgin Atlantic lower fuel surcharges
BA and Virgin Atlantic lower fuel surcharges

Body
British Airways and Virgin Atlanticyesterday announ-ced significant reductions in the fuel surcharges imposed on 
passenger fares - months after a steep fall in crude oil prices began to lower their fuel costs.
The West Texas Intermediate crude oil price surged to a peak of $147.27 a barrel in July, threatening the survival of 
many carriers but has since fallen by more than two-thirds. It settled yesterday at just over $40 after hitting a four-
year low earlier in the day.
In October both carriers reduced the fuel surcharges levied on economy and premium economy fares for long-haul 
flights but left the surcharges on long-haul business class and, in BA's case, on short-haul fares unchanged.
BA said it was lowering the surcharges on long-haul fares from today by as much as a third. The move reflected the 
reduction in the oil price and the group's fuel hedging policy for 2009-10.
BA's fuel costs rose 52 per cent to £1.49bn in the first six months of the current financial year from April to 
September. The airline has forecast that its fuel bill for the full year to March will rise £1bn to about £3bn.
The weakness of the pound against the US dollar, the currency used in oil trading, has reduced the advantage of 
the lower oil price. BA has also derived less benefit because more than half of its fuel requirements are still hedged 
at higher prices. The airline said last month it had hedged only 40 per cent of its requirements for 2009-10 to take 
advantage of the lower prices.
Other carriers including Air France-KLM and Luft-hansa have moved more quickly to lower their surcharges.
BA has come under sustained attack from Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, for its delay in lowering the fuel levies.
The airline said it was reducing the surcharge on long-haul economy fares for flights of more than nine hours £30 to 
£66 per one-way flight. On flights of less than nine hours the surcharge would be reduced £15 per sector to £53.
For long-haul business and first-class flights over nine hours the surcharges would be reduced £35 per sector (one-
way flight) to £98 (or £196 return) and £20 to £78 on shorter flights.
BA and Virgin Atlantic lower fuel surcharges
On domestic and European short-haul services surcharges will be reduced £4 to £12 per sector in economy and £5 
to £15 per sector in business class.
The reductions announced by Virgin Atlantic, which operates only long-haul services, were identical to those made 
by BA.

EU court backs Ryanair in airport subsidy battle

Body
An EU court on Wednesday backed budget airline Ryanair in a battle with state aid regulators on how far small 
airports can use public money to attract low-cost carriers.
The ruling from the European Union's appeals court allows Ryanair to keep a discount of more than €4 million 
($5.48 million) that it received from the Belgian Walloon regional government to help run flights out of the state-
owned Charleroi airport.
Charleroi originally gave the Irish airline up to 90 percent of its costs over 15 years in a deal that Ryanair has 
mimicked with regional airports across Europe.
The EU Court of First Instance said the European Commission was wrong to demand Ryanair refund the sum in 
2004, saying antitrust regulators had made a mistake in deciding the payments were an illegal state subsidy and 
not checking whether private investors would also have offered Ryanair low fees to start using the airport.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said there was "no doubt" that the court decision also made meaningless 
other EU investigations into claims that Ryanair received illegal subsidies at eight other airports in Denmark, 
Finland, France, Germany, Italy and Slovakia
"A public authority like the Walloon Region or Charleroi is allowed to behave like a private airport behaves and that 
is to enter into long-term low-cost arrangements with an airline like Ryanair which in return guarantees very rapid 
traffic growth," he told reporters.
EU spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen insisted that the judgment "does not have an immediate impact on the 
other cases" and said it was too early to say if regulators would appeal.
O'Leary claimed there weren't much grounds for appeal in the court ruling.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, triggered a revolution in air travel by offering bargain fares 
that saw millions more Europeans take to the skies even if that meant an hour-long trip from a regional airport to 
their city destination.
EU court backs Ryanair in airport subsidy battle
O'Leary said Charleroi had boomed after it struck its pact with Ryanair, pulling in other airlines and nearly 2 million 
passengers a year and becoming a valuable business worth some €100 million ($137 million).
"The Ryanair partnership with Charleroi has transformed an airport that was in 2001 effectively unused and empty. 
Today it is a growing, thriving, profitable international airport," he said.
But other airlines and Brussels' main airport, Zaventem, had complained that Ryanair's special treatment from the 
Walloon government was unfair. EU regulators ruled in February 2004 that parts of the Ryanair contract were illegal 
state aid and must be changed.
Ryanair struck deals in 2000 with the airport's owner the Walloon Region and the Brussels South Charleroi Airport 
company, or BSCA also owned by the Walloon Region which operates the airport, 42 kilometers (26 miles) south of 
the Belgian capital Brussels.
The Walloon Region gave Ryanair a half-price deal on landing charges that are usually fixed by regulation and 
promised to compensate the airline if it lost money on any changes to airport charges.
In return, Ryanair pledged to base two to four aircraft at the airport and turn each around at least three times a day. 
The deal was for 15 years.
The BSCA also said it would help fund Ryanair's costs and pay it €1 ($1.37) per passenger for ground handling 
rather than the €10 ($13.69) it charges other airlines.
The EU ordered the Belgian government to retrieve the discount that Ryanair got. The money was frozen in a bank 
account until Wednesday's appeal. Ryanair said it would now get that money back plus interest and some of the 
costs of legal action.
Ryanair's deal with Charleroi was renegotiated in 2005 and extended at lower cost, the company said.
O'Leary said Ryanair was now in talks with starting services at 47 airports that it doesn't fly to, including Brussels 
Zaventem, Copenhagen and several in Italy following a rash of airline cutbacks and collapses in recent months.

Budget airline Ryanair may no longer have to pay back a €4.5 million ($6.16 million) subsidy to the Belgian state 
after a court ruled Thursday against an EU order to refund the sum.
The European Union's appeals court said antitrust regulators made mistakes when they ordered Ryanair to pay 
back the public money it got to help it run flights from Charleroi airport in the southern Belgium region of Wallonia.
The EU Court of First Instance said the European Commission should have looked at whether the money from 
Belgian state companies could be seen as a normal market investment and not state help.
Charleroi was granting the airline up to 90 percent of its costs over 15 years in a deal the Irish airline has mimicked 
with small airports across Europe.
Ryanair said the court ruling backed the airport's business model of attracting business with low charges for favored 
airlines. It called on regulators to drop similar subsidy investigations at eight other airports that Ryanair uses.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, triggered a revolution in air travel by offering bargain fares 
that saw millions more Europeans take to the skies even if that meant an hour-long trip from a regional airport to 
their city destination.
In February 2004, EU regulators ruled parts of Ryanair's contract with Charleroi were illegal and ordered the airline 
to make changes.
Ryanair struck deals in 2000 with the airport's owner the Walloon Region and the Brussels South Charleroi Airport 
company, or BSCA also owned by the Walloon Region which operates the airport, 42 kilometers (26 miles) south of 
the Belgian capital Brussels.
The Walloon Region gave Ryanair a half-price deal on landing charges that are usually fixed by regulation and 
promised to compensate the airline if it lost money on any changes to airport charges.
EU court: Ryanair won't have to pay back subsidy
In return, Ryanair pledged to base two to four aircraft at the airport and turn each around at least three times a day. 
The deal was for 15 years.
The BSCA also said it would help fund Ryanair's costs and pay it €1 ($1.37) per passenger for ground handling 
rather than the €10 ($13.69) it charges other airlines.
The European Commission started investigating these payments after receiving complaints from rivals and decided 
they were illegal state aid that gave the company an unfair advantage over others.
It ordered the Belgian government to retrieve the money.
But Ryanair claimed that the Walloon Region was acting like any other private company by striking a deal to attract 
investment.
The court supported that argument, saying that fixing landing charges and giving lower ground handling rates was 
linked to the business of managing the airport.
It said the Commission had made "an error in law" by failing to consider that the region was acting as a private 
investor.
The Commission can appeal the case to the EU's highest court, the European Court of Justice.

The Dublin shares market bucked the trend across European bourses today to make gains with Ryanair a big 
winner but with banks mostly lower again.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 46.67 points at 2,519.43.
European shares fell this morning, hurt by worries over more losses at major banks, but a rise in the price of crude 
on expectations of a production cut lifted energy stocks, limiting broader market losses.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.7 percent at 829.01 points, not enthused by a 
Federal Reserve rate cut and a pledge of more unconventional steps to fight a deep recession. Banks took most 
points off the index, with BNP sliding 16 percent after its investment banking unit suffered a 11-month loss, hit by 
rocky capital markets and its exposure to an alleged dollar 50 billion fraud by U.S. financier Bernard Madoff. Banks 
were mostly lower in Dublin too with AIB down 3c to E1.87, Bank of Ireland edged down 2c to E0.90, Anglo Irish 
managed to gain 2c to E0.32 while Irish Life and Permanent flopped by 24c to E1.46. The heads of the Irish 
operations of ALBK (Donal Forde) and BKIR (Ritchie Boucher) were quizzed by the Oireachtas Committee on 
Finance and the Public Service. AIB revealed that its outstanding loans to small-and-medium-sized businesses 
(SMEs) have risen by 6pc to E9.5bn this year, while overdrafts are up 11pc to E3bn. Elsewhere, US housing starts 
fell to a seasonally-adjusted annualised rate of 625,000 in November, well short of the street's estimate of 736,000. 
With October's rate revised to 771,000, the month-on-month fall of 18.9pc was the steepest monthly decline 
registered since March 1984. Building permits, considered a good lead indicator of future residential construction 
activity, also fell heavily in November. Shares in CRH jumped 66c to E20.47. Ryanair was a major gainer of the 
morning with its shares climbing by 17c to E2.97. Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion and the airline's 
chairman Colm Barrington are to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport tomorrow to discuss 
Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus. Meanwhile, Ryanair welcomed the decision of the European Court of First Instance

The Dublin shares market bucked the trend across European bourses today to make gains with Ryanair a big 
winner but with banks mostly lower again.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 46.67 points at 2,519.43.
European shares fell this morning, hurt by worries over more losses at major banks, but a rise in the price of crude 
on expectations of a production cut lifted energy stocks, limiting broader market losses.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.7 percent at 829.01 points, not enthused by a 
Federal Reserve rate cut and a pledge of more unconventional steps to fight a deep recession. Banks took most 
points off the index, with BNP sliding 16 percent after its investment banking unit suffered a 11-month loss, hit by 
rocky capital markets and its exposure to an alleged dollar 50 billion fraud by U.S. financier Bernard Madoff. Banks 
were mostly lower in Dublin too with AIB down 3c to E1.87, Bank of Ireland edged down 2c to E0.90, Anglo Irish 
managed to gain 2c to E0.32 while Irish Life and Permanent flopped by 24c to E1.46. The heads of the Irish

Body
Ryanair today welcomed the decision of the European Court of First Instance (CFI), which overturned the European 
Commission's 2004 decision on Ryanair's base agreement with Charleroi airport.
Ryanair also today called on the European Commission to drop its cases against a number of similar airports 
(Alghero, Aarhus, Bratislava, Hahn, Lubeck, Pau, Schonefeld, Tampere) and to focus instead on real and blatant 
breaches of the state aid rules by Europe's flag carriers, such as the most recent illegal bailout of Alitalia by the 
Italian Government, and the E500m. state aid by the Austrian Government to Lufthansa as a 'sweetener' to 
encourage them to buy Austrian Airlines.
Ryanair's Jim Callaghan said: "Ryanair is delighted with the Court's decision. Charleroi airport has been the model 
of how small regional and secondary airports around Europe can transform themselves from unused, loss-making 
facilities into profitable commercial entities, which are providing lower costs, competition and choice for European 
consumers - just as Ryanair has for airline flights. This complaint was originally brought by Brussels Zaventem 
Airport in an effort to block competition from Charleroi Airport and the Commission should have rejected it.

More detail has emerged about what the Ryanair Boeing 737-800 crew faced following a multiple birdstrike on short 
final approach to Rome Ciampino airport on 10 November. According to sources close to the investigation, when 
the crew sighted a huge flock of starlings ahead they initiated a go-around, but the birds rose into the flightpath and 
the aircraft suffered a considerable loss of power on both engines.
The crew were flying the aircraft manually when, passing about 200ft (60m), the starlings - an estimated 1,000 in 
number - "engulfed" the aircraft, and the fan speed on the engines dropped from its normal approach setting of 
about 65% to 40%, and moving the power levers produced no result. Within 30s of the pilots' first sighting of the 
birds the aircraft had made a hard landing and come to a halt on the runway.
Flocks of starlings, known as "murmurations", can be vast and are known for changing direction fast and 
unpredictably.
The carrier's safety director Michael Horgan says: "To bring the aircraft to a safe landing following a major loss of 
power on both engines required a level of composure and skill that is a credit to both Capt Frederic Colson and first 
officer Alexander Vet and underscores Ryanair's exceptional flying standards."

Aer Lingus has claimed there is nothing new in the official offer document sent to its shareholders yesterday by 
Ryanair.
Colm Barrington, the feisty new chairman of the flag carrier, described it as "the usual stream of invective, spin and 
misrepresentation that we expect from the people at Ryanair".
It was, said Mr Barrington, a desperate last effort to create an airline monopoly in Ireland.
And he said this was clearly not in the interests of Aer Lingus shareholders or the travelling public. Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary had claimed earlier that Aer Lingus faced a "bleak future" if his bid did not succeed. If 
Aer Lingus partnered with a major European carrier, he said, it would simply become a small part of a non-Irish 
group. However, by joining up with Ryanair, it would be part of one big Irish airline that would rank as the fourth 
largest in Europe. Aer Lingus shares closed 4pc lower at 144 in Dublin last night after the release of the document.

No-frills airline Ryanair launched its hostile attempt to take over Aer Lingus today by writing to its rival's 
shareholders, imploring them to accept an E750 million bid.
The low-cost carrier, which already owns almost 30pc of Aer Lingus, said in its newly published offer document that 
other investors should vote in favour of a creation of a united Irish airline by January 5.
It offered E1.40 a share for the former state airline this month, just half the price of a previous offer in 2006 which 
was blocked by the EU on competition grounds.
Aer Lingus has said it would fight vigorously to defeat the new approach, including by seeking a "white knight" 
investor. But Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told reporters that in the absence of any other bidder 
entering the fray, the group's bid had a "strong prospect of success". Regulators last week blocked sweeteners 
included in Ryanair's initial proposals saying they could breach takeover rules by favouring one shareholder, 
namely the government. But in the document Ryanair moved to appease the regulators, saying it would call an 
extraordinary general meeting to make Aer Lingus's valuable Heathrow slots impossible to sell without a vote of 
both the Dail and the Seanad.

News In Brief
## AIB is investigating a fault in its computer systems that cost retailers millions of euro when credit and debit card 
facilities failed on Saturday. For at least an hour on Saturday afternoon, the busiest shopping day of the year so far, 
AIB customers were unable to use their debit or credit cards and shops using AIB processing systems were equally 
disabled. The glitch caused chaos in many busy stores and led to long queues at ATM machines as shoppers 
sought to get cash for purchases. AIB said there was a technical problem in its systems, which it is still 
investigating. A spokeswoman apologised to customers for the inconvenience caused. - Irish Times
## Batches of bottled water have been removed from the shelves of three major supermarket chains around the 
country after tests raised concern over hygiene standards.The move came after scientists discovered bacteria 
which indicated the possible faecal contamination of water sold by Superquinn, Lidl and Aldi. The discovery 
prompted the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) to order the supermarket chains to withdraw the products from 
sale. However, the FSAI was criticised last night for not making details of the withdrawals public, the extent of which 
was only revealed in leaked memos. - Irish Independent
## The Musgrave group - which owns the SuperValu and Centra supermarket and convenience store chains - is 
understood to be close to adding to its chain of Budgens supermarkets in Britain by buying a number of Somerfield 
stores from the Co-Operative group. Musgrave operates 180 Budgens outlets and a further 2,000 Londis stores in 
the British market. Tesco, Spar, Morrison's and Lidl have all recently bought Somerfield stores from the Co-Op as 
the group seeks to sell off more than 100 stores to keep within competition guidelines. - Irish Examiner ## Northern

O'Brien is set to cast his 2.5 per cent holding in Aer Lingus against the Ryanair bid. The Digicel owner has told an 
NCB Wealth Management meeting that he would resist any effort by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary to take over the 
airline. Mr O'Brien is reported to have been adamant that he did not want to see the two airlines under one owner, 
not only because of the dangers of a monopoly but also because he was not a fan of the Ryanair style of operation. 
- Irish Independent ## The Northern Ireland Executive will hold a special meeting this morning where it is expected 
to finalise an economic aid package to tackle the credit crunch. Ministers will meet at Stormont Castle to agree a 
package, with finance minister Nigel Dodds due to address the Assembly later today. The Assembly is also to hold 
a special session - three days after its Christmas recess was supposed to have started - to debate the blueprint 
proposed by ministers. - Press Association ## The number of homeowners turning to the State for help repaying 
their mortgage has more than doubled in the last two years. Almost 8,000 homeowners are now claiming the 
mortgage interest supplement -- a State scheme set up to stop mortgage interest taking too much of a toll on cash-

Aer Lingus to spend less on advisers
Aer Lingus to spend less on advisers

Aer Lingus has capped the amount it will spend on external advisers to defend itself against Ryanair's renewed 
takeover attempt, in response to criticism that the EUR 24 million it paid on its earlier takeover defence was 
excessive.
Chief financial officer Sean Coyle told The Sunday Business Post that the airline had committed to a level of 
spending ''significantly below'' the EUR 24 million paid out following Ryanair's 2006 approach. He said Aer Lingus 
would extract greater efficiencies during the current takeover approach by hiring fewer advisers and negotiating 
reduced fee levels with external firms.
The sharp reduction in merger and acquisition activity since 2006 would give the airline greater negotiating power 
and meant fee deals would be ''much cheaper this time out'', according to Coyle. Examples of the cost savings 
sought by the airline included a decision to hire a single Irish stockbroking firm, Goodbody, on this occasion instead 
of the two, Goodbody and Merrion, that were engaged in 2006.
Coyle, a former Ryanair executive who replaced outgoing chief financial officer Greg O'Sullivan earlier this year, 
said Ryanair's renewed approach was ''frustrating'' and an ''unwelcome'' attempt to take up Aer Lingus 
management time. ''We need to remove that source of frustration going forward," he said.
Coyle also said it would not be difficult to convince shareholders that the EUR 1.40 per share offer, valuing Aer 
Lingus at EUR 748 million, was too low. Competition issues and Aer Lingus's prospects of delivering a superior 
return as a standalone entity would also strengthen the Aer Lingus board's case when the offer was put to 
shareholders.

Aer Lingus may consider resuming short-haul flights from Shannon, including restoring the Heathrow route, The 
Sunday Business Post has learned.
Informed sources have said that the airline will consider bringing back the route, with the possibility of two slots on 
the back of cost savings at Shannon. The move is a response to Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary's promise 
to restore Shannon-Heathrow flights if his  748 million takeover bid for the airline is successful.
It comes after Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion's announcement last Friday, that the airline was to 
remove all fuel surcharges on its long-haul services booked on flights from today.
An airline spokesman declined to confirm Aer Lingus's future plans for the Shannon-Heathrow route.
''Given the recent ballots from trade unions, long haul is safeguarded, and conditions are now such that it may be 
economic for Aer Lingus in the future to recommence short-haul flights from Shannon," the spokesman said.
Meanwhile, divisions are believed to be emerging in the Aer Lingus board, following chairman Colm Barrington's 
proposal last week to consider aligning with an overseas airline, in order to prevent Ryanair from making further 
bids to acquire the former state carrier.
Barrington, who became Aer Lingus chairman in October, said last Friday that the board was ''looking at options'' to 
prevent Ryanair from making further bids in the future. The Sunday Business Post understands, however, that while 
the board unanimously rejected the Ryanair offer, the idea of teaming up with a third airline had not been discussed 
by the board when it began considering the approach earlier this month.
The board's initial response to the offer concentrated on promoting the twin defences of the competition obstacles, 
and convincing shareholders that the  1.40-per-share offer was too low.
Aer Lingus : Heathrow Shannon may return
Separately, a frontbench Fine Gael meeting this Tuesday is likely to formalise its rejection of O'Leary's offer, citing 
key concerns about a Ryanair monopoly and the protection of Ireland's connectivity with major hubs.
O'Leary's plan to outline his proposals to an Oireachtas transport committee this Thursday is in doubt.
Meanwhile, Ryanair will have to hand back  4 million in subsidies if it loses its appeal against an EC ruling on state 
aid for flights to Charleroi airport in Belgium. The Court of First Instance will announce its decision on Wednesday.

Air passenger numbers drop 8.9%
Air passenger numbers drop 8.9%

Highlight: Fall hits BAA as it tries to sell Gatwick
9.8% fewer flights in UK airspace
Body
Air traffic fell sharply in November registering the biggest decline since November 2001, when the 9/11 terrorist 
attacks in the US helped to plunge global aviation into recession.
Passenger numbers at BAA's seven UK airports fell last month by 8.9 per cent year-on-year from 10.8m to 9.8m - 
by far the steepest monthly year-on-year de-cline since traffic began to weaken in April. The pace of the decline has 
been accelerating since September.
As well as passenger numbers at the airports, the volume of flights moving through UK airspace is in sharp decline 
as airlines cut their schedules and ground aircraft to try to bring capacity more into line with falling demand for air 
travel.
Nats, the air traffic control service, said November, the first full month of the winter travel schedules, had shown a 
9.8 per cent decrease in the number of flights it had handled from 188,000 to 169,500.
The steep fall in passenger numbers is hitting BAA just as it is trying to sell Gatwick airport. It could soon be facing 
a demand from the Competition Commission to dispose as well of Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh 
airports in order to improve competition.
Traffic at Gatwick fell by 13.5 per cent year-on-year in November. The airport has been hit by the recent collapse of 
several carriers including Zoom Airlines, XL Airways and Denmark's Sterling Airlines.
It has also suffered in particular from the transfer of a large number of its US long-haul services to Heathrow as a 
result of the US/European Union "open skies" treaty.
Both American Airlines and Continental Airlines have closed their Gatwick bases, and British Airways has 
transferred several US long-haul services from Gatwick to Heathrow.
Air passenger numbers drop 8.9%
BAA said Heathrow, the busiest airport in Europe measured by passenger numbers, was proving the most resilient 
of its UK airports to the deepening recession with a fall of 4.8 per cent partly because of its greater share of the 
stronger long-haul markets.
By contrast Stansted, the most important airport in Europe for low-cost airlines, suffered a fall of 13.2 per cent under 
the impact in particular of the cut in flights by Ireland's Ryanair. The carrier has grounded 15 aircraft at the airport 
for a large part of the winter   to eliminate loss-making routes.
Monthly traffic numbers at Stansted have been falling for 13 months in succession year-on-year, but the drop in 
November was by far the steepest decline.
Passenger numbers at Glasgow fell by 15.6 per cent in November, the sharpest drop of any BAA airport, with 
numbers at the Scottish airports, including Edinburgh and Aberdeen, declining by 11.5 per cent.
Volumes at the three London airports Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted fell by 8.4 per cent overall.
Many airlines that have already reduced capacity for the winter are also preparing to reduce flights in the next 
summer season. British Airways, for example, is due to remove four more aircraft from its Gatwick operations, 
cutting departures at the airport by 15 per cent. Ground staff there are being reduced by 8 per cent.

As the pound fell to its lowest level against the euro, the spending power of consumers showed similar weakness. 
Retailers provided evidence that consumers were cutting back on spending in the key pre-Christmas period. 
Elsewhere, companies in a variety of sectors took bearish steps to reduce exposure to a recession and there were 
several new casualties. The failure of a car parts maker was a sign of more pain to come in that sector, following 
the rejection of the US government's plan for a $14bn (£9.4bn) bail-out of the motor industry.
General Retailers 
Andy Bond, chief executive of Asda, pointed to evidence of a Depression-era mindset in shoppers, who were 
boosting sales of home hair-dye kits and frozen food at the supermarket chain. Sales of frivolous gifts had collapsed 
following the move into a new consumer era where frugal was "cool", Mr Bond said. Asda, part of Wal-Mart, has 
been one of the strongest beneficiaries of the trend for shoppers to seek the lowest prices. Woolworths, the one-
time icon of the British high street, held a closing-down sale that left bargain hunters disappointed at the mixed bag 
of remaining stock and discounts that were not as steep as advertised. Talks being held by Deloitte, its 
administrator, to keep the variety retailer operating as a going concern appeared to have failed as would-be buyers 
have struggled to fund their proposals. If no buyer is found, the 99-year-old chain's 30,000 staff are likely to lose 
their jobs.  HMV , the music and books retailer, reported narrower first-half losses, saying it expected to benefit from 
Woolworths' demise by picking up market share.
Travel & Leisure 
The chief executives of Qantas and Iberia said British Airways must choose one of them as a merger partner. BA 
and Qantas recently announced that they were in merger talks and the British airline has previously held talks with 
Iberia, the Spanish carrier. Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, insisted it was not an "either/or" deal. Analysts said the 
benefits of a BA/Qantas deal were less obvious than those of a tie-up with Iberia - BA and the Australian airline 
already run a joint venture between their countries. In a further sign of the consolidation in the European airline 
industry, Virgin Atlantic, the long-haul carrier controlled by Sir Richard Branson, said it was in talks with Germany's 
The Week
Lufthansa about the future of BMI British Midland. Lufthansa is taking over majority control of BMI, the second-
largest operator at London Heathrow. Meanwhile, Irish flag- carrier Aer Lingus pledged to return to the black next 
year thanks to deep cost cuts and the steep fall in fuel prices. Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, recently 
launched its second hostile bid for Aer Lingus in two years.
Automobiles 
The UK businesses of Wagon, the European car parts maker controlled by Wilbur Ross, the US billionaire investor, 
were poised to go into administration as it became the latest victim of a downturn in European car sales. The move 
came as Wagon's banks, led by Royal Bank of Scotland, declined to back an emergency funding package following 
a suspension of shares in the company in October. Zolfo Cooper was appointed as administrators of Wagon and 
several of its British subsidiaries. Wagon supplies car parts to Peugeot, Citroën, Fiat, Mercedes-Benz, Renault and 
Audi, and has plants in other European countries. Up to 500 jobs are at risk at the company's two plants in 
Coventry and Walsall, and its head office in Birmingham. On Friday, concern focused on Vauxhall, following the 
collapse of Washington DC's effort to agree legislation to lend $14bn (£9.3bn) to the US auto industry. General 
Motors, Vauxhall's owner, said it was in talks with the UK government about securing cash to keep the UK car 
manufacturer operating. Vauxhall employs 5,500 people in the UK.
Mining 
Rio Tinto announced it would cut jobs and sell assets in an attempt to raise cash, pay debts and regain the 
confidence of its shareholders. The mining group pledged to reduce its net debt of $38.9bn by $10bn by the end of 
2009 by cutting $5bn from its capital expenditure budget, cutting 13 per cent of its workforce and putting mines up 
for sale.
Oil & Gas 
BP and its Russian billionaire partners in TNK-BP  agreed a $1.2bn cut in capital expenditure for the Russian oil 
venture next year as the two sides met in Paris. Denis Morozov, the former chief executive of Norilsk Nickel, has 
been tipped as the new chief executive of TNK-BP, following the departure of Robert Dudley in July.
