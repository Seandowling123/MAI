Ireland's competition authority dealt Ryanair's renewed bid for Aer Lingus a severe blow Friday, ruling that its most 
recent promises to woo shareholders violate takeover laws.
The Irish Takeover Panel ordered Ryanair to withdraw two key pledges to the Irish government the second-largest 
Aer Lingus shareholder with a 25.1 percent stake that offered to give the government control of the airline's 
Heathrow slots and a €100 million ($130 million) guarantee.
The competition authority said Ryanair's sales pitch was illegal, because its special pledges to the government 
"constitute arrangements with an Aer Lingus shareholder containing favorable terms which were not being 
extended to all Aer Lingus shareholders."
Ryanair and its primary takeover advisers, Morgan Stanley and Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin, said in a statement 
they "strongly disagree with the decision of the Takeover Panel."
Nonetheless, Ryanair said it would revise its sales pitch and ensure "delivery of these benefits and guarantees in a 
form consistent with the constraints imposed by the Irish Takeover Panel."
Ryanair is the biggest Aer Lingus shareholder with 29.8 percent and this month launched a new offensive to 
persuade the government and Aer Lingus employees to part with their shares.
On Dec. 1, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary offered €1.40 ($1.90) a share, a 25 percent premium over the 
price at the time. Three days later, O'Leary sought to sweeten the deal with new commitments addressed at others' 
anxiety about a Ryanair-run Aer Lingus.
O'Leary promised to give the government veto power over whether Aer Lingus' most strategic asset its ownership of 
slots at London's Heathrow Airport could be sold. The government says retention of the Heathrow slots is important 
to Ireland's economic future.
O'Leary also offered a €100 million bank guarantee that would be paid to the government if Ryanair failed to meet 
its pledges to lower Aer Lingus charges and increase its work force by 1,000 within three years.
Ryanair 's new bid for Aer Lingus suffers setback
The competition panel which includes representatives from Irish banks, stockbrokers, accountants and law firms 
said Ryanair also should revise or withdraw two other pledges apparently directed at Aer Lingus employees, the 
third-largest shareholder.
O'Leary said Ryanair would recognize the authority of labor unions active in Aer Lingus, and would reopen Aer 
Lingus services between Heathrow and Shannon, the major airport in western Ireland. Both moves would appeal to 
Aer Lingus workers.
Ryanair refuses to negotiate directly with unions, which are entrenched in Aer Lingus' work force. Aer Lingus' 
surprise decision last year to slash Shannon services in favor of a new base in the British territory of Northern 
Ireland infuriated Aer Lingus employees.
The Irish Takeover Panel said Ryanair should withdraw those pledges unless it clarifies "to whom the commitments 
are being given," and involves no favoritism to a particular group of shareholders.

Irish airline Aer Lingus announced Friday it has stopped adding hefty fuel charges to its long-haul tickets, ending a 
two-year practice introduced to offset the soaring cost of oil.
The decision affects Aer Lingus services to several U.S. cities and to the Middle East emirate of Dubai and 
responds to one of the sharpest points of criticism from its major Dublin rival and would-be owner, Ryanair.
Aer Lingus and many other long-haul airlines began introducing extra fuel surcharges to ticket prices in 2006, and 
repeatedly increased the charges as oil headed up to $140 a barrel.
At their height this year, Aer Lingus fuel charges added €220 ($300) to the cost of a round-trip West Coast trip and 
€150 ($200) to New York, Boston or Washington. Aer Lingus began lowering the charges last month as oil fell 
below $50 a barrel.
"Now that oil prices have fallen and stabilized ... we believe the right thing to do is to remove these surcharges 
altogether," Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said in a statement.
Aer Lingus denied any connection between the decision and its resumed takeover battle with Ryanair. Europe's 
leading no-frills airline already owns 30 percent of its shares and on Dec. 1 made a €1.40-a-share offer for the rest 
of the Irish flag carrier.
Ryanair has repeatedly described Aer Lingus' fuel charges as a guise for masking higher fares. As part of its 
renewed takeover bid Ryanair promised to get rid of Aer Lingus' surcharges within weeks if it won control of the 
airline and to pay the Irish government €100 million ($130 million) if it failed to do this.
Ireland's competition authorities on Friday ruled that promise illegal because it offered preferential treatment to the 
government, a 25-percent holder of Aer Lingus shares.

Ryanair broke stock exchange regulations when it made a number of pledges relating to its new bid for Aer Lingus, 
the Irish Takeover Panel said today.
Last week, Ryanair pledged to reinstate the Shannon-Heathrow route and recognise unions at Aer Lingus should its 
takeover bid be successful.
The Takeover Panel today said these breached stock exchange rules as they were arrangements with one 
shareholder - the Government - and were not being extended to all shareholders. It has prohibited Ryanair from 
giving these commitments as part of any offer for Aer Lingus.
It also promised to provide a E100 million bank guarantee to eliminate Aer Lingus's fuel charge. Ryanair said as 
part of the merger deal it would give the Government control of Aer Lingus's takeoff and landing slots at London's 
Heathrow airport in order to guarantee the continuation of routes from Ireland. "By giving watertight control over Aer 
Lingus' (Heathrow) slots, we effectively remove any need for the Irish government to retain a strategic 
shareholding," chief executive Michael O'Leary said. Ryanair said the merger would see the return of the Shannon-
Heathrow route with a minimum twice daily frequency. The Heathrow slots needed to meet this commitment would 
be switched from one of Aer Lingus's other Heathrow routes, it said. Ryanair also pledged to provide another E100 
million bank guarantee that Aer Lingus' short haul fares would be reduced by a minimum of 5 per cent for a three 
year period.

Aer Lingus will seek a friendly investor to take a majority stake in the airline and stave off an E750 million bid from 
arch-rival Ryanair, its chairman was quoted saying today.
"If they don't get us this time around, they won't get us again because I am not going to stay as chairman for three 
years and have this hanging over me," Colm Barrington said in an interview with the Irish Times.
Barrington said he had not identified a perfect partner for Aer Lingus, but said from a consumer and a country point 
of view Air France KLM "would be a better option than Ryanair". Air France KLM declined comment.
Aer Lingus's board rejected Ryanair's all-cash bid of E1.40 a share, arguing it significantly undervalued the airline. 
Europe's biggest budget airline tried to buy Aer Lingus for double the price of its current bid in 2006, but was 
thwarted by an EU ruling that it would create a near monopoly in European flights out of Dublin. Yet Aer Lingus's 
campaign to remain independent could be a hard sell when small airlines are being gobbled up across Europe. 
Analysts say the wave of consolidation could give Ryanair a greater chance of success in getting its offer past 
European competition authorities. But Barrington, who was appointed chairman in September, was not convinced. 
"Airline consolidation is bit like sex, there's more talk about it than actually takes place," he said. Aer Lingus said 
this week it expects a job-cutting deal with unions will boost its performance next year after securing 50 million 
euros on savings. Before it secured the deal, Aer Lingus had said it would report an operating loss next year. 
Barrington did not rule out a link-up with a private equity group. "It could be a short-term solution for independence, 
but private equity can be fickle too," he said. Barrington, who knows Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary from 
their days working for the airline's founder Tony Ryan, said Aer Lingus would also consider issuing shares to dilute 
their rival's near 30 percent shareholding. Ryanair has tried to appeal directly to the government and employees, 
holders of more than 25 percent and 14 percent of the former state carrier. (C ) Reuters

Aer Lingus would bounce back into profit next year thanks to deep cost cuts agreed in recent days with its trade 
unions and the steep fall in fuel prices, Sean Coyle, chief financial officer said yesterday.
The Irish flag carrier is under attack from Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, which last week launched its 
second hostile bid for the airline in two years.
Mr Coyle said the package of cost cuts and productivity measures, which had faced the threat of industrial action, 
had been backed in ballots and would secure the full EUR74m (m$99) of annual cost savings sought by the airline.
Sweeping reforms of working practices among ground services staff and cabin crew had been agreed and would 
bring savings of EUR50m, including a reduction of up to 400 jobs from a workforce of 4,100.
In return for the reforms the airline agreed to drop its plan to outsource about 1,300 jobs in ground services and to 
start employing new groups of cabin crew recruited in the US on many of its Ireland/US routes.
Analysts estimate that the annual savings of EUR50m a year in employee costs will lead to one-off severance and 
labour charges of EUR100m, leading to a big net loss of EUR95m to EUR100m in 2008. The net loss will include a 
previously forecast operating loss of more than EUR20m this year, but Mr Coyle said Aer Lingus expected to be 
profitable at both the operating and net profit levels in 2009.
Colm Barrington and Dermot Mannion, respectively Aer Lingus chairman and chief executive, have met Noel 
Dempsey, Irish transport minister, to press for government support to oppose the Ryanair bid. The state holds a 25 
per cent stake in Aer Lingus and Ryanair holds 29.8 per cent.
Mr Mannion said after the meeting "Ryanair cannot spin away the fact that Aer Lingus is and will continue to be its 
fiercest competitor into and out of Ireland.
Bid target Aer Lingus expects profits next year
"It is offering other Aer Lingus shareholders a mere EUR525m, a pathetic sum in the context of the EUR1.3bn in 
cash on the group's balance sheet, the substantial value of our fleet and the value of the Heathrow slots. Aer Lingus 
remains a strong business with significant cash reserves and a robust long-term future."
Ryanair's first bid, two years ago, was blocked by the European competition authorities. It said last week it planned 
to merge the two carriers into "one strong Irish airline group under common ownership".
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the competitive landscape had changed since the first rejection 
with a wave of consolidation under way in the European airline industry.

Colm Barrington is on a mission. The new chairman of Aer Lingus fired the first salvo yesterday in his campaign to 
refute the "big lies" he claims are being told about his airline by Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive.
Ryanair launched its second hostile bid in two years for its smaller Irish rival last week. And in contrast to many of 
his previous battles, Mr O'Leary may have found an opponent more than willing to trade blows.
Mr Barrington, a leading yachtsman, is a grandee of the Irish aviation industry, which has supplied senior managers 
at some of the world's biggest airlines, including British Airway and Qantas.
Some 15 years older than Mr O'Leary, Mr Barrington knows his rival well from their days working for Tony Ryan, 
whose company, GPA, invented and became the world leader in aircraft leasing in the 1980s.
Mr Barrington is now chief executive of Babcock & Brown Air, a New York-listed and Irish-based aircraft leasing 
group, and was appointed chairman of Aer Lingus in September.
Mr O'Leary has named his former colleague as the only Aer Lingus director he would want to keep on. 
Nevertheless, Mr Barrington is determined to block Ryanair's ambitions to swallow Aer Lingus.
"Mr O'Leary wants . . . to get EUR800m ($1.1bn) net cash into his own bank," Mr Barrington says, before adding 
that the deal would not benefit "the 4m Irish people that have a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus through the 
government's holding".
The latest Ryanair offer of EUR1.40 a share is half its bid in October 2006, but still a 25 per cent premium to the Aer 
Lingus closing price of EUR1.12 before the bid was launched.
Mr Barrington, though, says a deal would leave Ryanair "in control of about 80 per cent of all air travel in and out of 
Ireland".
Ryanair finds itself in an aerial dogfight
He attacked Ryanair's pledge to cut Aer Lingus fares by 5 per cent for three years as "a meaningless promise". Aer 
Lingus short-haul fares were already nearly 7 per cent lower than in 2007, he claimed, and were expected to fall a 
similar amount in 2009.
Aer Lingus is owned 29.8 per cent by Ryanair, 25 per cent by the Irish state and about 18 per cent by employee 
interests.
Mr Barrington was critical of Mr O'Leary's offer to guarantee trade union recognition for Aer Lingus's heavily 
unionised workforce. Such recognition is already secured in Irish law in a company being acquired. The assurance 
was "meaningless".
Mr O'Leary has fought fiercely not to recognise any unions at Ryanair itself and had compared them to "the Taliban, 
the Moonies and the Monster Raving Looney Party", says Mr Barrington. Mr O'Leary's need for government support 
for his bid meant he was presenting "a new face, a benign, loving and cuddly Michael O'Leary, rather than the 
aggressive Michael O'Leary we have known and loved for 20 years".
He dismissed Mr O'Leary's claim that Aer Lingus was a failing airline "tottering from crisis to crisis". "If people 
believe it, they are really naive."
If you believe Mr Barrington, Aer Lingus has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, with gross cash of 
EUR1.3bn and net cash of EUR800m. It has made profits, it has generated cash, it has a modern fleet and has 
expanded its network.
Mr Barrington rejected Mr O'Leary's claim that Aer Lingus would not survive the accelerating consolidation in the 
industry and was instead planning to expand outside Ireland.
Seconds out. The next round of a long, long fight has started.

Colm Barrington
Chairman, Aer Lingus
Former colleagues are squaring up in the battle for unchallenged supremacy in Irish aviation, writes Kevin Done
Body
Colm Barrington is on a mission. The new chairman of Aer Lingus fired the first salvo yesterday in his campaign to 
refute the "big lies" he claims are being told about his airline by Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive.
Ryanair launched last week its second hostile bid in two years for its smaller Irish rival. And in contrast to many of 
his previous battles, Mr O'Leary might have found an opponent more than willing to trade blows.
Mr Barrington, a leading offshore yachtsman, is a grandee of the Irish aviation industry, which has supplied senior 
managers at some of the world's biggest airlines, including British Airways and Qantas. Some 15 years older than 
Mr O'Leary, Mr Barrington knows his rival well from their days working for Tony Ryan, whose company, GPA, 
invented and became the world leader in aircraft leasing in the 1980s.
Mr Barrington is now chief executive of Babcock & Brown Air, a New York-listed and Irish-based aircraft leasing 
group, and was appointed chairman of Aer Lingus in September.
Mr O'Leary has named his former colleague as the only Aer Lingus board member he would want to keep on. 
Nevertheless, Mr Barrington is determined to block Ryanair's ambitions to swallow Aer Lingus along with its pile of 
net cash and take an unchallenged position in the Irish market.
"Mr O'Leary wants . . . to get EUR800m (£710m) net cash into his own bank," Mr Barrington says, before adding 
that the deal would not benefit "the 4m Irish people that have a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus through the 
government's holding. It is not a good deal for anyone except Mr O'Leary and Ryanair."
The latest Ryanair offer of EUR1.40 a share is half its bid in October 2006, but still a 25 per cent premium to the 
closing price of EUR1.12 before the bid was launched.
Chairman targets O'Leary 'lies'
Mr Barrington, though, says a deal would leave Ryanair "in control of about 80 per cent of all air travel in and out of 
Ireland. It would have a totally monopolistic position."
He attacks Ryanair's pledge to cut Aer Lingus fares by 5 per cent for three years as "a meaningless promise". Aer 
Lingus short-haul fares are already nearly 7 per cent lower than in 2007, he claims, and are expected to fall a 
similar amount in 2009.
He also dismisses a Ryanair promise to remove Aer Lingus fuel surcharges on long-haul fares. Such offers are 
"easily given" when the oil price has fallen below $50 a barrel.
Aer Lingus is owned 29.8 per cent by Ryanair, 25 per cent by the state and about 18 per cent by employee 
interests.
Mr Barrington is sceptical about Mr O'Leary's offer to guarantee trade union recognition for Aer Lingus's heavily 
unionised workforce. Such recognition is already secured in Irish law in a company being acquired.
Mr O'Leary's need for government support for his bid means he is presenting "a new face, a benign, loving and 
cuddly Michael O'Leary, rather than the aggressive Michael O'Leary we have known and loved for 20 years," Mr 
Barrington says.
He dismisses Mr O'Leary's claim that Aer Lingus is a failing airline "tottering from crisis to crisis" as the "big lie, you 
cannot believe anything Ryanair says. If people believe it, they are really naive."
If you believe Mr Barrington Aer Lingus has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, with gross cash of 
EUR1.3bn and net cash of EUR800m. It has made profits, it has generated cash, it has a modern fleet and has 
expanded its network.
His words show the airline is not going to give up without a fight.

Aer Lingus calls Ryanair takeover bid `pathetic'
Aer Lingus calls Ryanair takeover bid `pathetic'

Dateline: DUBLIN Ireland
Body
The chief executive of Irish airline Aer Lingus branded a renewed takeover attempt by Ryanair "pathetic" as he 
lobbied the Irish government Thursday for its help to repel the hostile bid.
Dermot Mannion said Ryanair's €1.40 ($1.86) offer per share, unveiled Dec. 1, fell far short of Aer Lingus' true 
worth. The offer puts a €748 million ($996 million) value on Aer Lingus a business that has €1.3 billion ($1.7 billion) 
in the bank.
Mannion called Ryanair's offered price "a pathetic sum in the context of the €1.3 billion in cash on the group's 
balance sheet, the substantial value of our fleet and the value of the Heathrow slots."
Ryanair launched its initial bid shortly after the government floated Aer Lingus on the British and Irish stock 
exchanges two years ago. It offered €2.80 a share at that time, and has built up a 30 percent stake to become the 
top shareholder.
But firm opposition until now from the government, the second-largest shareholder with a 25 percent stake, has 
helped to blunt Ryanair's ambitions. So has a June 2007 ruling by European Union competition authorities that the 
Dublin-based rivals the only two airlines to offer substantial air services in and out of Ireland would create a 
monopoly if merged.
Mannion met Transport Minister Noel Dempsey to seek government assurances that it wouldn't sell any shares to 
Ryanair. The government has wavered since Dec. 1, because it faces a financial crisis involving a sharp drop in tax 
revenues and soaring deficit spending and could badly use the €188 million ($250 million) that Ryanair is offering.
Dempsey declined to comment.
Even Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary admitted last week that the €1.40 offer, if successful, would mean 
that Ryanair acquired its rival for "almost nothing" because of its healthy bank accounts.
But O'Leary argues that Aer Lingus has no medium-term future in the face of competition from Ryanair and 
Europe's rapidly consolidating flag-carrier airlines.
Aer Lingus calls Ryanair takeover bid `pathetic'
Last week O'Leary sought to eliminate issues that drove opposition to the original Ryanair move. He pledged that a 
Ryanair-controlled Aer Lingus would cooperate with labor unions in contrast to Ryanair itself, which rejects union 
authority and he would give the Irish government the final say on whether Aer Lingus kept or sold its much-sought 
slots at London's Heathrow Airport. O'Leary also pledged to increase Aer Lingus' work force by 1,000.
Labor union leaders snubbed O'Leary's overture and instead overwhelmingly fell into line with Mannion's own plans 
to cut staff and working conditions because of current Aer Lingus losses. Before the Ryanair bid, those unions had 
been threatening Christmas strikes.
Investors expect O'Leary to increase the price of Ryanair's offer in hopes of tempting both the government and Aer 
Lingus employees, who own about 18 percent of shares and are sitting on heavy paper losses from the airline's 
privatization. Aer Lingus stock has risen above Ryanair's offer price in expectation of an increased bid price.
Aer Lingus shares slipped 0.7 percent Thursday to €1.50 ($2.00) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Ryanair fell 5.7 
percent to €3.04 ($4.04).

Plan for Stansted second runway slips back
Plan for Stansted second runway slips back

Body
A second runway at London Stansted airport will not be built until the second half of the next decade at the earliest, 
it emerged yesterday.
The Civil Aviation Authority, airport economic regulator, has followed recommendations from the Competition 
Commission to exclude the £2.3bn project at Stansted from the price control regime for the next five years to March 
2014.
The CAA's decision means BAA, Stansted's owner, will have no funding from higher charges to finance 
development work until a new price regime is introduced in six years.
The competition watchdog last month questioned the urgency of the expansion at Stansted against a background of 
"deteriorating economic and financial conditions". Monthly traffic volumes at the UK's third-largest airport have been 
falling year on year for 12 months in succession.
The Competition Commission said its traffic forecasts indicated a second runway would not be needed until 2017 at 
the earliest, two years later than proposed by BAA.
A planning inquiry is due next year into BAA's proposal to build the second runway and a second terminal. The 
inquiry could be derailed, however, by a change of ownership of the airport. The commission is separately 
investigating the structure of BAA and has provisionally recommended the break-up of the group's airport 
monopolies in London and Scotland, including the sale of Stansted. BAA has already started the process to sell 
Gatwick.
The CAA said yesterday it was proposing to freeze charges - the per passenger levy on airlines - in real terms at 
Stansted for both 2009-10 and 2010-11. It proposed small increases of 1.6 per cent above inflation in the 
subsequent three years, taking the charge to £6.65 per passenger in 2013-14.
Plan for Stansted second runway slips back
BAA said it was "disappointed" that a significant element of its spending to date on preparing for expansion at 
Stansted had thus been ruled out. "We will continue to press for a regulatory framework which reflects the full cost 
of bringing forward the second runway proposals at Stansted," it said.
However, the CAA proposals were welcomed by Ryanair and EasyJet, the biggest operators at the airport, which 
have been campaigning hard to keep charges and capital spending at the airport in check. "Keeping prices broadly 
flat over the coming years should ensure consumers continue to be protected from BAA's worst monopolistic 
excesses," said EasyJet.
The CAA said it would also impose a service quality rebate scheme at Stansted similar to those at Heathrow and 
Gatwick with financial penalties - up to 7 per cent of charges - if BAA failed to meet agreed standards.

Aer Lingus expects a deal on job cuts to boost its performance next year and help it rebuff a 750 million euro bid 
from Ryanair.
"We will be recalibrating the budget for 2009 ... and we will come out with a much better figure in 2009 than 
anything that is currently there," Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion told RTE.
"This will reposition Aer Lingus, yet again, as an airline that will be even better able to compete wth Ryanair."
The former state airline secured union agreement to cut at least 200 jobs and implement a pay freeze which will 
deliver 50 million euro in cost savings. Before the jobs deal, Aer Lingus said it would report an operating loss next 
year. It expects to generate a full-year operating loss near the lower end of a 20 million euro to 30 million euro 
range this year. Mannion has vowed to keep Aer Lingus independent and plans to present a defence strategy 
against Ryanair's all-cash bid of 1.40 euro a share. He said Aer Lingus, which has been buffeted by the Irish 
recession, would be introducing new short-haul services next year. This is Ryanair's second attempt to buy Aer 
Lingus. Its first attempt, at double the current offer, was thwarted by the European Commission on competition 
grounds in 2006. "The situation is even more difficult from a competition position now than it was two years ago," 
said Mannion. "Where are the other airlines going to come from in the current climate to pick up slots at Dublin 
airport if these two airlines merge?" Aer Lingus shares were 1.9 percent firmer at 1.58 euro in early morning trade, 
outperforming the main ISEQ which was up 0.3 percent. Copyright: Reuters.

in getting its offer past European competition authorities. A previous attempt to buy Aer Lingus, at double the latest 
offer, was thwarted by the European Commission on competition grounds in 2006. However, Mannion said the 
absence of third-party competition made it even more difficult for Ryanair to argue its case. "Where are the other

Regional airline Eurowings said Monday it would sell its low-cost subsidiary Germanwings to Deutsche Lufthansa 
AG, though financial terms were not discussed.
Dortmund-based Eurowings said in a statement the transaction should become effective Jan. 1, 2009.
Lufthansa already holds a 49 percent stake in Eurowings.
With the sale, Eurowings can focus on its profile as a regional carrier and allows Germanwings to develop its low-
cost model inside the Lufthansa group.
"Eurowings can now concentrate more on its core business," said Friedrich-Wilhelm Weitholz, the chief executive of 
Eurowings in the statement. He said the phase of successfully building Germanwings to the company it is today is 
finished.
The statement said Joachim Klein, currently the chief executive of Germanwings and a management board member 
of Eurowings, will step down from his the position at Germanwings once the transaction has been completed. He 
will remain on the Eurowings management board.
Germanwings operates a fleet of 19 Airbus A319s. In 2007, the company saw nearly 8 million passengers board its 
aircraft, achieving sales of €630 million.
Germanwings flew its first flight October 27, 2002. The company was established to compete with the likes of 
Ryanair and Easyjet on the short and medium-haul European market. Germanwings' destinations include 
Reykjavik, Iceland; St. Petersburg, Russia, Malta, and Istanbul.
Eurowings currently has a fleet of 35 aircraft, 20 Bombardier CRJs and 15 British Aerospace aircraft. In 2007, 
Eurowings flew 2.7 million passengers.
Lufthansa on Friday agreed to buy the Austrian government's stake in ailing Austrian Airlines and offered to buy any 
outstanding shares.
Eurowings to sell Germanwings unit to Lufthansa
The agreement signed by Lufthansa and officials of Austria's privatization agency gives Lufthansa the state's 41.56 
percent share in its Austrian counterpart.
Shares of Lufthansa were up 6 percent at €10.80 ($14) in Frankfurt afternoon trading.

Aer Lingus looks to EC to block Ryanair takeover
Aer Lingus looks to EC to block Ryanair takeover

Aer Lingus will rely on the European Commission blocking Ryanair's renewed bid for the former state airline as its 
principal defence against the proposed EUR 748 million takeover, and the airline will not seek a competing bid from 
another European airline, The Sunday Business Post understands.
Meanwhile, Air France/KLM is believed to be preparing to distance itself from a potential counterbid.
The European giant is unenthusiastic about pursuing an approach to Aer Lingus, because a tie-up would not be 
considered a strategic priority. Aer Lingus's stance follows a statement to the stock exchange last week that 
rejected Ryanair's EUR 1.40 per share bid - exactly half the EUR 2.80 it offered during its first takeover attempt two 
years ago.
The company said Ryanair's proposed offer was not capable of being completed because its previous attempt had 
failed to get the necessary antitrust clearance.
It is expected to recommend to its shareholders - including the Irish government, which has a 25 per cent stake - 
that they vote against the offer when Ryanair's formal offer document is published.
The government is understood to be taking the Ryanair bid seriously but will await the offer document before 
issuing a formal statement. The considered response of transport minister Noel Dempsey sharply contrasts with the 
original bid, which was promptly rejected on competition grounds by his predecessor, Martin Cullen.
Dempsey is understood to be taking a ''neutral'' stance on the bid, but sources indicated that he was likely to weigh 
up a number of key issues. The attraction of the Ryanair takeover would be to create a single strong ''Irish'' airline, 
rather than Aer Lingus merging with a foreign-based company. It would also mean that one of the big four airline 
groups in the world would be managed from Ireland.
But on the downside, a merged Ryanair-Aer Lingus entity would have greater influence than at present when 
negotiating landing charges at Irish airports.
Aer Lingus looks to EC to block Ryanair takeover
An immediate cash injection of EUR 188million is believed to be attractive for the government in light of the 
deterioration in exchequer finances. Another potential attraction is Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary's 
promise to create 1,000 new jobs over the next five years and to double the size of the Aer Lingus short-haul fleet 
over the same period.
The main government concern is the near-monopoly created by a Ryanair-Aer Lingus merger which would not be in 
the interests of the consumer - and which the European Commission judged to be anti-competitive two years ago.
There is also a concern that Ryanair would use its monopoly position to ''scare off " competition from other airlines 
operating out of Ireland, as has happened in the past.
In an interview with this newspaper, however, O'Leary dismissed concerns over a Ryanair monopoly, saying the 
airline already had monopoly positions at Shannon and Knock airports but was still reducing fares.
A government sell-off would also mean a radical change to the government's aviation policy which seeks to protect 
competition, strategic regional interests and aviation connectivity.
Meanwhile, Fine Gael met Ryanair last week and plans to meet Aer Lingus officials this week to discuss the bid 
before issuing a statement.
Sources said it would be ''taking the long-term interests of Aer Lingus and the country into account'' and expressed 
concern about competition issues.
Siptu warned that Ryanair would end up dominating an open island economy, with ''the travelling public, exporters 
and airport authorities, as well as the workforce, being held as hostages to fortune''.

Here we go again. Ryanair wants Aer Lingus - for half what it offered to pay two years ago - but Aer Lingus says the 
deal won't happen.
Putting all the peripheral complications aside, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has a straightforward 
problem.
The main reason put forward by Aer Lingus to justify not recommending the  748 million ( 1.40 per share) offer to 
shareholders is that the European Commission is likely to veto it.
''This new lower offer is not capable of completion," Aer Lingus told the stock exchange last Monday, some 11 
hours after O'Leary went public with his new bid.
Given that O'Leary will not be able to disprove this theory for months, if not years, he appears to have little hope of 
steering the debate beyond the competition issue in the short-term.
It may not be that simple, however. The Aer Lingus board has a convenient comfort blanket in using the likelihood 
of a commission veto to smother O'Leary's second attempt to wrest control of the former state airline. But it needs 
to be careful that its actions remain consistent with its mandate of maximising value for Aer Lingus shareholders.
In most takeovers, the job of the acquiree's board is to negotiate the best price it can before selling out. If it does 
not want to sell, it must prove that it can deliver a better deal for shareholders by remaining independent. It must 
convince them to hold on in the hope that the share price will, within a reasonable time, be substantially higher than 
the price offered - and deliver on that hope.
Aer Lingus, however, sings from a different hymn sheet. While it also told shareholders last week that the  1.40 per 
share undervalued the company - just as it did two years ago, when  2.80 was on the table, but was still deemed 
insufficient - its reliance on the competition issue is a worrying sign for those who regard a board's primary function 
as maximising value for shareholders.
Up in the air
If a deal is attractive to shareholders, boards tend to look for reasons to do it, instead of reasons not to. Last week, 
however, Aer Lingus attempted to convince shareholders that the  1.40 offer (25 per cent more than the share price 
before the offer was announced) was an illusion; it could never be paid because the commission would never allow 
it.
Although the strategy is acceptable - the commission, after all, blocked Ryanair's original approach - it is not without 
risk. Playing the same game as it did two years ago assumes that what worked then will still work now. O'Leary, for 
his part, stressed last week that the aviation world had changed dramatically since his last approach.
''Europe is now signing off on all these airline amalgamations," he said. ''I think the chances [of succeeding] are 
much better than they were two years ago."
But Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion disagreed.
''The competition issues that were there two years ago really haven't changed," he told this newspaper.
So who's right? And what has changed?
According to Ryanair, a wave of 30 airline failures so far this year, driven by high fuel prices and a recession-
sparked decline in demand, will mean that standalone flag carriers such as Aer Lingus are no longer sustainable. 
O'Leary said smaller players would be swept up by the industry's big three in Europe Air France/KLM, Lufthansa 
and BA - and that Aer Lingus, supposedly unwanted by the big three, had nowhere else to go but into Ryanair's 
arms.
The commission would not stand in the way of a tie-up in those circumstances, he said. Mannion, meanwhile, 
argued that Aer Lingus would do just fine as a standalone entity and that it had a strong balance sheet to prove it. 
But the airline industry was not the only thing to have changed.
O'Leary's move appeared to have been at least partially motivated by a belief that the government would also be 
more likely to look kindly on the prospect of a merged Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
Last week's offer would mean a  188 million windfall for the government if it opted to cash in its 25 per cent stake in 
Aer Lingus now. While the choice facing Taoiseach Brian Cowen, finance minister Brian Lenihan and transport 
minister Noel Dempsey could never be as clear-cut as one of simply taking the money to help bridge the gaping 
hole in the exchequer finances, the government's response to the latest offer has been noteworthy for its 
noncommittal nature.
Two years ago, Bertie Ahern's administration rushed to reject any suggestion that it would even consider O'Leary's 
approach.
This time, however, official signals are more conciliatory. Dempsey met a Ryanair delegation headed by O'Leary 
last Wednesday, but will await the publication of the formal offer document before making his intentions clearer.
The rationale for the state retaining its stake has undoubtedly diminished since Aer Lingus went public. Its interest 
created an enormous political headache last year, when Mannion decided that the realities of commercial life meant 
the airline could no longer operate short-haul routes from Shannon, dramatically axing its services to Heathrow in 
favour of establishing new services from Belfast.
Dempsey was spared a difficult choice between backing management and retaining the Shannon-Heathrow link last 
year, when the Aer Lingus board refused to grant Ryanair's request for a shareholder vote on the issue. But the 
episode highlighted the uncomfortable tightrope-walking act involved in the government retaining a strategic stake 
while, at the same time, allowing Aer Lingus management the freedom to run the airline in an independent, 
commercial manner.
O'Leary upped the political ante last week with a loaded offer to reinstate the Shannon-Heathrow link if Ryanair 
gained control of Aer Lingus.
Up in the air
The move will force the government to decide whether it wants to incur further anger in the Shannon region by 
refusing to accede to O'Leary's request, or to upset Aer Lingus's Dublinbased employees by giving its blessing to 
the takeover.
No matter what way Dempsey, Lenihan and Cowen jump in the coming weeks, the state is quickly running out of 
reasons to remain on the Aer Lingus shareholder register.
It had already agreed to take aback seat when Mannion and his team took commercial decisions that affected Aer 
Lingus routes.
O'Leary's moves to hand over control of the slots to the government, and guarantee that Aer Lingus services to the 
London hub will be maintained, could lead to much head-scratching at the cabinet table, as ministers struggle to 
explain why the state needs the 25 per cent stake any longer.
It is also worth noting that the make-up of the Aer Lingus board has changed since the heated debates of 2006. 
John Sharman, the chairman who spearheaded the Aer Lingus defence two years ago, has been replaced by airline 
industry veteran Colm Barrington, while Macquarie Bank and former Goodbody Stockbrokers executive Colin Hunt 
and trade unionist David Begg recently joined the board as nominees of the government and the unions, 
respectively.
In addition, former finance director Greg O'Sullivan stepped down earlier this year to make way for Sean Coyle, 
ironically a former member of Ryanair's management team.
While the Aer Lingus board was unanimous in its rejection of the first approach, the substantial change in personnel 
at the top could offer O'Leary hope that potential deal-doers may help his cause in future board meetings.
The board did itself little credit two years ago in dismissing the  2.80 offer as ''derisory'', only to see the share price 
plummet below the  1 mark as the airline industry fell out of favour with investors. It will not want to make the same 
mistake twice.

Aer Lingus yet to make case for Ryanair rebuttal
Aer Lingus yet to make case for Ryanair rebuttal

Section: COMMENT AND ANALYSIS
Length: 422 words
Body
The board of Aer Lingus was correct to reject the initial offer from Ryanair for the airline last week. The offer price of  
1.40 a share would effectively mean that Ryanair was getting the airline for nothing, given the  800 million cash pile 
on the Aer Lingus balance sheet.
However, by offering commitments on the slots at Heathrow and the Shannon Heathrow route, Ryanair chief 
executive Micheal O'Leary has made it clear that he will not be easily rebuffed. Were he to follow this with an 
increased offer price, then the Aer Lingus board - and the company's shareholders - will have to give the offer a fair 
hearing.
The world of aviation is changing rapidly, as shown by a wave of mergers and consolidation. This raises the 
question of whether Aer Lingus can remain viable as an independent entity. Already, Aer Lingus management and 
trade unions have worked together to lower costs and become more competitive.
Yet such is the relentless nature of pressure on the aviation business that more will be needed - whoever ends up 
owning the airline. And the airline will be competing in a world of rapid consolidation, as shown by the latest attempt 
by British Airways and Qantas to forge a merger. There are competition concerns. When Ryanair last bid for Aer 
Lingus, the European Commission said it would block the move on competition grounds. Now Ryanair has offered 
assurances in terms of fares, but - as the arrival of Ryanair itself demonstrated - nothing is more powerful in terms 
of holding down fares than real competition.
This is one reason why the move represents a dilemma for the government. There are other political sensitivities 
around Aer Lingus, but also key strategic questions. These surround airline access to Ireland and also the future of 
the key Aer Lingus slots at Heathrow.
It is a worrying time for Aer Lingus staff, who have shown themselves to be willing to work with management to 
increase productivity and keep the airline afloat. As with all decisions in the economic sphere, a key concern for the 
government must be to safeguard as many of these jobs as possible in the long term.
Aer Lingus yet to make case for Ryanair rebuttal
If the Aer Lingus board believes that the airline has an independent future, then it must state its case and persuade 
the main shareholders. Arguing that the existence of Aer Lingus is essential to preserve competition is not a 
sufficient case in itself.
A credible strategy for survival and profitability is essential if Aer Lingus is to remain independent. It remains to be 
seen whether it will be forthcoming.

Ryanair is failing to comply with European laws banning pre-checked boxes for flights booked on its website, 
according to the European Commission.
New rules provide that optional price supplements, such as insurance or priority boarding, must be accepted on an 
'opt-in' basis, rather than customers having to opt out of the charges. Ryanair also charges a fee for mandatory 
airport check-in by 14-to-17-year-olds travelling alone.
The European Commission announced last week that it was increasing pressure on airlines to ensure that ticket-
sales websites complied fully with EU laws requiring pricing transparency. The commission has written to a number 
of airlines setting out 26 consumer rights and asking them to ensure that their websites comply with the listed 
obligations.
''My message to the airline industry is very clear," said Consumer Commissioner Meglena Kuneva. ''Full compliance 
with EU law is an obligation, not an option."
The commission is to publish a compliance report next May.

The Bank of England cut interest rates to 2 per cent - their lowest levels since 1951 - in another attempt to boost the 
ailing economy. But for businesses and consumers alike, cost- cutting was still the priority.
The airline industry took dramatic steps towards consolidation and job losses continued across a diverse range of 
sectors.
Budget lines proved to be the lifeline of food retailers, as further evidence emerged that consumers were cutting 
back on spending.
Travel & Leisure 
British Airways announced it was in merger talks with Australia's Qantas , signalling a rapid shift towards 
consolidation in the airline sector. BA, which has also been in talks with Iberia , said the potential merger would 
take the form of a "dual-listed company structure" and would create "the first truly global airline".
The Spanish carrier responded to the surprise announcement by giving BA an ultimatum, saying it would have to 
choose between Iberia and Qantas as its future merger partner. Aer Lingus  rejected a fresh takeover bid from 
Ryanair , its larger Irish rival. The all-cash offer valued the former state-owned airline at EUR750m (£644m) - 
exactly half of the amount Ryanair offered in its original bid in October 2006.
In spite of resistance from the board, the Irish government later indicated that it might be ready to dispose of its 25 
per cent stake in Aer Lingus under the terms of the new bid. Stagecoach , the bus and rail operator, warned of a 
drop in profits next year on fears that falling employment in London would put the brakes on future growth.
Brian Souter, chief executive of the Perth-based company, said that the bus business would prove largely immune 
to recession but that its smaller rail operations would not.
Mr Souter warned that falling commuter numbers in the capital, a key driver of profitable traffic on its rail franchises, 
would cause a "modest" fall in profits in the year beyond April.
General Financial
The Week
New Star Asset Management , one of the UK's best-known fund managers, was forced to de-list from the stock 
exchange after its banking syndicate seized 75 per cent of the business in a debt-for-equity swap.
After months of damaging fund outflows, New Star announced its banks would cancel £240m of its £260m debt, 
prompting speculation about rival buy-outs.
The UK's biggest listed private equity group, 3i , announced plans to cut its workforce by about 15 per cent, 
signalling a sharp downturn in the industry.
The group, which is viewed as relatively defensive given its mid-market focus and geographical diversification, said 
it would cut about 100 jobs in back-office functions such as marketing and human resources.
General Retailers
Wm Morrison reported like-for-like sales growth of 8.1 per cent in its third-quarter trading update, easily 
outperforming its larger rivals.
Securing its position as the fastest-growing of the listed supermarkets, the grocery chain announced further 
expansion plans including the purchase of 38 stores from the Co-operative Group. Tesco  reported better-than-
expected sales growth in its third quarter, after managing to entice more customers through the doors with a new 
heavily discounted range.
The rate of growth, at 2 per cent, was still its lowest since the recession of the early 1990s, but the data suggested 
Tesco's latest strategy was helping it to stave off the worst effects of the downturn. Sir Richard Branson's Virgin 
Group  faced liabilities of up to £100m after it became the latest company to be caught up in the collapse of 
Woolworths .
The Zavvi chain, which was sold to management last year on condition that Virgin would continue to guarantee its 
payments for stock, was left without a batch of Christmas bestsellers following Woolworth's collapse.
Virgin had to step in with the funds so the music and DVD chain could pay cash up-front for goods from other 
suppliers.
Oil & Gas
Sibir , the London-listed Russian oil company, stunned the market by agreeing to bail out one of its largest 
shareholders by buying his troubled property portfolio for $340m (£221m).
The Aim-listed group, which had been considering a move to the main market, has lost up to 95 per cent of its value 
over the past five months.
Sibir argued that the move was necessary in order to save Chalva Tchigirinski from having to sell his 23 per cent 
stake - a sale that it says would have left the company open to "ruthless predatory activity".

Aer Lingus unions have rejected guarantees from Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, that he will recognise 
the unions if the shareholders agree his takeover offer.
"The corporate culture of Ryanair is just something that is a complete anathema to our members," said Niall 
Shanahan, communications officer with the IMPACT union. "An approach from Ryanair, having been through this 
process already, is something instinctively they would want to reject."
Aer Lingus staff own 14pc of the company through the Employee Shareholder Ownership Trust (ESOT), while the 
Government holds a stake of just over 25pc.
Last night, Mr O'Leary promised that, if its takeover offer for Aer Lingus is accepted it will recognise the unions, 
restore the Shannon to Heathrow route and place an E100m guarantee in the bank that it will cut fares. "This will 
ensure that the Irish Government's national aviation policy (as articulated at the time of the Aer Lingus' IPO), to 
ensure a minimum level of connectivity between London Heathrow and Dublin, Cork and Shannon, will be 
guaranteed into the future. This proposed provision in the Aer Lingus articles of association (which will be detailed 
in the Offer Document) will correct the deficiencies in Aer Lingus' existing Articles, which allowed Aer Lingus to 
close the Shannon-Heathrow route and replace it with a Belfast-Heathrow route, despite the Government's 
objection. This guarantee' will ensure that Heathrow's connectivity to Dublin, Cork and Shannon can be protected 
by the current and future Irish Ministers for Transport for the benefit of Ireland and all Irish consumers/visitors," Mr 
O'Leary said. ESOT is expected to meet on Monday to discuss Ryanair's bid, according to a Reuters report.

Government holds a stake of just over 25pc.
Last night, Mr O'Leary promised that, if its takeover offer for Aer Lingus is accepted it will recognise the unions, 
restore the Shannon to Heathrow route and place an E100m guarantee in the bank that it will cut fares. "This will 
ensure that the Irish Government's national aviation policy (as articulated at the time of the Aer Lingus' IPO), to 
ensure a minimum level of connectivity between London Heathrow and Dublin, Cork and Shannon, will be 
guaranteed into the future. This proposed provision in the Aer Lingus articles of association (which will be detailed 
in the Offer Document) will correct the deficiencies in Aer Lingus' existing Articles, which allowed Aer Lingus to 
close the Shannon-Heathrow route and replace it with a Belfast-Heathrow route, despite the Government's 
objection. This guarantee' will ensure that Heathrow's connectivity to Dublin, Cork and Shannon can be protected 
by the current and future Irish Ministers for Transport for the benefit of Ireland and all Irish consumers/visitors," Mr 
O'Leary said. ESOT is expected to meet on Monday to discuss Ryanair's bid, according to a Reuters report.

Ryanair sweetened its takeover bid for Aer Lingus last night in a concerted effort to win the support of the Irish 
government.
The state owns a 25 per cent stake and is the largest shareholder after Ryanair itself, which holds 29.8 per cent. Its 
backing is crucial if Ryanair is to gain majority control following the launch on Monday of its second hostile takeover 
bid for the carrier in two years. The government strongly opposed the first bid in October 2006.
Ryanair said last night that it would give the government full control over Aer Lingus's take-off and landing slots at 
London Heathrow; restore the route between Shannon and Heathrow, which was dropped by Aer Lingus last year, 
triggering a political outcry in western Ireland; and would guarantee trade union recognition at Aer Lingus.
One of the key tenets of Irish aviation policy has been the safeguarding of Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots. Dublin has 
been concerned that Ryanair would seek to sell the lucrative slots, eliminating routes to Ireland's closest global hub.
In response Ryanair said it would change Aer Lingus's articles of association to give a legally binding guarantee 
that the slots could not be sold, transferred, leased or switched to any other airline or to any other route without 
prior written government approval. This would guarantee routes to Heathrow from Dublin, Cork and Shannon.
Ryanair also sought to allay union fears last night by offering to "commit and guarantee" Aer Lingus's "long-standing 
policy of trade union recognition". An employee share ownership trust holds a 14 per cent stake in the airline.
Ryanair launched an all-cash offer on Monday of EUR1.40 a share, valuing Aer Lingus's equity at EUR748m 
(£649m). Aer Lingus shares closed 5 cents higher last night at EUR1.35.

Ryanair strengthens sales pitch for Aer Lingus

Ryanair dramatically strengthened its sales pitch Thursday for rival Aer Lingus, offering key assurances to the 
airline's two other major shareholders in hopes of persuading them to sell their stakes.
Ryanair renewed its 2-year-old bid to take over Aer Lingus earlier this week, but faces a daunting task to persuade 
the Irish government and Aer Lingus employees to cash in their shareholdings. Ryanair already holds about 30 
percent of Aer Lingus shares, but together the government and Aer Lingus employee-controlled trust hold more 
than 40 percent and can block any takeover.
In a declaration Thursday, Ryanair made a series of new commitments about the future direction of a Ryanair-run 
Aer Lingus.
It promised to recognize the authority of Aer Lingus' labor unions, give the Irish government control of Aer Lingus' 
strategically valuable slots at Heathrow Airport in London and provide a €100 million ($125 million) insurance policy 
if it defaulted on promises to cut Aer Lingus air fares and fuel surcharges.
Ryanair also promised to reopen Aer Lingus routes linking Heathrow with Shannon, the major airport in western 
Ireland. Aer Lingus infuriated the government and much of Ireland last year when it shut down the Shannon 
services and moved them to the Northern Ireland capital of Belfast, thinking the British territory would be more 
profitable.
Two years ago, the government retained a 25 percent stake when it floated Aer Lingus on the British and Irish stock 
exchanges. It stressed that the holding would be used to defend competition in Irish air services and specifically to 
ensure the Heathrow slots were never sold to a foreign airline.
But since then, Ireland has plummeted from being the strongest economy in western Europe to one of its most 
troubled. The government is struggling to cope with massive shortfalls in taxes, surging unemployment and an out-
of-control deficit making a sale of its Aer Lingus stake suddenly look good.
Ryanair strengthens sales pitch for Aer Lingus
Irish unions bitterly oppose working for Ryanair. Europe's No. 1 budget airline refuses to engage directly with 
unions and demands more of its work force than at Aer Lingus.
But head-to-head competition with Ryanair has already weakened Aer Lingus, which cannot match Ryanair's 
average fares or range of European destinations.
Aer Lingus is pressing ahead with plans to lay off more than 1,000 employees in coming months whereas Ryanair 
as part of its renewed takeover bid is pledging to expand Aer Lingus' work force by 1,000.

Ryanair has promised that, if its takeover offer for Aer Lingus is accepted it will recognise the unions, restore the 
Shannon to Heathrow route and place an E100m guarantee in the bank that it will cut fares.

It also promised to scrap all Aer Lingus fuel surcharges if their bid is successful. "Ryanair believes that these 
substantial guarantees and financial penalties, which will be unique to the proposed Ryanair-Aer Lingus airline 
merger, will afford consumers, the Irish Government, the European Commission and all other stakeholders the 
necessary confidence in Ryanair's guarantees. Ryanair believes that these reductions in Aer Lingus' short haul 
fares and removal of Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges will deliver annual consumer savings of over E140 million, and will 
meet national aviation policy by promoting and securing the competitiveness of Aer Lingus' short and long haul 
network, and increasing competition between Aer Lingus' lower fares and Ryanair's services on short haul routes to 
and from Ireland," the airline said.

Government to consider takeover
Sale would place it at odds with board
Body
The Irish government yesterday signalled it might be ready to dispose of its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus under 
the terms of a take-over bid tabled by Ryanair earlier this week.
Brian Lenihan, finance minister, told Irish radio that Ryanair "has made an offer which we will have to carefully 
consider".
But he added "the government will have to be very, very careful how they dispose of this very valuable national 
asset".
Ministers are worried about any change in ownership of Aer Lingus' landing slots at Heathrow, which are seen as 
vital for the Irish economy. They are also concerned about job losses.
But Mr Lenihan is facing severe budget constraints, and his remarks suggest the government has not ruled out 
selling its stake, contrary to its reaction to Ryanair's more generous earlier takeover bid in late 2006.
This potentially puts it on a collision course with Aer Lingus' board, which has already rejected the EUR1.40-a- 
share offer, which values the former state-owned carrier at EUR750m (m$948).
One of the new elements of the Ryanair offer is an undertaking to create 1,000 new jobs over a five-year period by 
increasing the Aer Lingus fleet.
Analysts say Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, has been careful to meet trade union and government 
concerns about job losses, recognising that the government together with an employee trust owning 14.4 per cent 
have, in effect, a blocking stake.
Ryanair offers to buy 25% of Aer Lingus
But Mr O'Leary also warned that even if Aer Lingus achieved the EUR50m of cost savings currently targeted, its 
cost per passenger would still be more than twice that of Ryanair.
Aer Lingus employees were last night set to respond to a novel costcutting programme under which workers were 
invited to leave the company and rejoin on less generous terms and conditions.
Company and trade unions brokered the compromise deal at the Labour Relations Commission, the main dispute 
arbitration body, as an alternative to the company's original plan to outsource 1,300 ground staff jobs.
Under the agreement, staff can either accept voluntary redundancy, take the "leave and return", which would entitle 
them to a EUR30,000 minimum lump sum severance pay, or they can stay on under the same terms and 
conditions.
The company is aiming to make savings of EUR24m as part of the bid to return the airline to profitability.
However, the company says the success of the scheme will depend on how many staff take up the "leave-and-
return" offer.

AIB added 18c early on to 237, while Irish Life and Permanent lifted by 8c to 152.
Bank of Ireland was up by 4c to 113, while just Anglo Irish was in the red, continuing its slide after its results of 
yesterday. It was down another 7c a short time ago at 59.
Overall the ISEQ index was up by 90.06 points to 2,569.62. Away from the financials, bakery firm Aryzta was up 
99c to 2530, and building materials giant CRH had risen 43c to 1763. Elan gained 28c to 533, and Aer Lingus 
advanced by 4c to 132, suggesting that someone believes the Ryanair takeover bid for the former state-owned 
carrier will succeed.

Boylesports is offering odds of 2/1 that Ryanair will succeed in taking over Aer Lingus by the start of 2009.
The bookie thinks, however, that the 748m euro being offered by the low-cost carrier is too low, and is offering odds 
of 5/6 on a successful bid coming in at a price above 1bn euro.
It is also offering odds that the two airlines will merge into a single brand, with 5/1 available for Aer Ireland and 8/1

Ireland battles deficit as jobless rate surges
Ireland battles deficit as jobless rate surges

Body
Ireland's unemployment rate surged to a decade high of 7.8 percent in November, surprising economists and 
deepening the government's struggle to contain its budget deficit.
The Central Statistics Office reported an unexpectedly sharp jump from October's rate of 7.4 percent hours after the 
government conceded that its budget planning for 2009 was in disarray because of grossly overestimated tax 
forecasts.
Unemployment has not been this bad in Ireland since April 1998. And the swelling numbers of people signing on for 
jobless benefits is even worse, reaching a 12-year high above 268,000. The different milestones reflect the fact that 
Ireland's population and job market have grown strongly during the so-called "Celtic Tiger" economic boom.
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told the nation that, after more than a decade of unprecedented wealth gains, 
citizens must accept a declining standard of living. Lenihan said he had already raised taxes as high as he could in 
an emergency October budget, so a new wave of spending cuts in government services must follow. He also 
warned that civil servants might not get pay raises agreed for 2009.
"I am saying to people that we are living beyond our means and we have to face up to that," Lenihan told state 
broadcasters RTE. He added that defending Ireland's competitiveness "means you do sometimes have to take a 
reduction in your current standard of living."
In October, Lenihan proposed about €2 billion ($2.6 billion) in spending cuts and €1 billion in tax hikes including 
new levies on individual incomes that range from 1 percent to 3 percent that he hoped would control the plunge in 
state finances.
But on Tuesday, the Finance Department announced that tax collections for this year were coming in nearly €2 
billion lower than expected even two months ago, reflecting a collapse in the property market and depressed 
consumer spending.
It means Ireland faces a 2008 deficit exceeding €8 billion, rather than the €6.5 billion envisioned in October.
Ireland battles deficit as jobless rate surges
Lenihan said Ireland had already reached "a limit to the amount of any taxation an economy can take when it is in 
the kind of crisis our economy is in."
He declined to rule out a range of possible measures, including a reduction in Ireland's minimum wage or the sale 
of its 25 percent stake in the Aer Lingus airline. Ryanair on Monday launched a new takeover bid for its Irish rival in 
hopes of exploiting the government's cash needs.
Two years ago the government helped reject Ryanair's initial attempt to acquire Aer Lingus. But Lenihan said 
Wednesday that government ministers "will have to be very, very careful in how they dispose of this very valuable 
national asset." Ryanair "has made an offer which we will have to carefully consider," he said.
Unemployment is now growing much faster than the government's forecasts. This is expected to swell the deficit 
because there are fewer wage-earners to pay a bigger-than-expected welfare bill.
Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham Stockbrokers in Dublin, called Wednesday's unemployment figures 
"truly awful" and said surging joblessness "has blown a massive hole" in the government's plans to rein in its deficit.
McQuaid forecast unemployment would reach 8.4 percent in December and double digits next year.
Several economists and opposition lawmakers called for the government of Prime Minister Brian Cowen to 
stimulate the economy with business tax cuts and increased spending, even though this would worsen the deficit.
The government remains publicly committed to reducing its deficit spending to 3 percent of gross domestic product, 
the rule for its membership in the euro common currency. Ireland's deficit currently exceeds 6 percent of GDP and 
appears likely to breach 7 percent next year.

The east's innovators are no threat to the west
The east's innovators are no threat to the west
Financial Times (London, England)

Body
Innovation is a word like democracy. Everyone is in favour of it, but different people attach different meanings to it. 
Sometimes the term is used to describe anything that differentiates one product or process from another. At other 
times, innovation is the product of men in white coats who conduct rarefied experiments in biotechnology or 
electronics.
Is Easyjet an innovative company? Along with Ryanair, the company transformed the European aviation market. 
But everything the company did was already done by someone else, and the entire product and process were close 
to those South West Airlines had pioneered in the US.
There is no purpose in arguing about what is the correct definition of innovation. What matters is that people 
understand what they are saying when they talk to each other. The frequent, often unnoticed, shift between wide 
and narrow definitions of innovation may be seriously misleading. Generalities about the importance of innovation in 
creating competitive advantage in business are translated into specific policies to subsidise research and 
development and the promotion of particular kinds of scientific education.
Such policies are described as "techno nationalism" in an important recent book called The Venturesome Economy 
by Amar Bhidé. Techno nationalism is derived from the belief that economic growth depends on high technology 
and that we will benefit fully from it only if it is our own high technology. Techno nationalism is as common in 
Europe, which believes it is falling behind, as in America, which fears it may be overtaken. But the fear that western 
economic prosperity is endangered by China's flood of engineering graduates is not only exaggerated: it may be the 
reverse of the truth.
The central fallacy of the New Economy bubble was that most of the benefits of new technologies would go to 
pioneering companies. But the repeated experience of economic history is that competition ensures that the larger 
part of the benefits of these technologies accrue to users. In an admittedly speculative calculation, the American 
economist Bill Nordhaus has suggested that consumers get more than 97 per cent of the value of innovations.
What is true of companies is also true of states. The US has a world leading position in information technology but 
the products of that technology are available everywhere with minimal delay. And cheaply: the profits of Microsoft, 
though large in absolute terms, are less than 0.1 per cent of the national income of the US and Europe.
The east's innovators are no threat to the west
That is why economist Paul Romer can observe that: "In 1985, I paid $1,000 per million transistors for memory in 
my computer. In 2005 I paid less than $10 per million and yet I did nothing to deserve or help pay for the windfall." 
But Prof Bhidé is not so sure that Prof Romer did nothing to deserve it and nor am I.
What distinguishes the US is not just its innovative technologists, but its innovative manufacturers, retailers and 
consumers. Discoveries are made in an environment that is responsive to ideas, ready to embrace change and 
always willing to try out something new. People who are likely to invent things want to be part of a culture that is 
open to novelty, and cultures that are open to novelty are those that will reward innovators best. That is why there 
are so many entrepreneurs of Chinese and Indian origin in the US - and Britain - even as more and more mundane 
jobs are outsourced to China and India.
The pesky American students who are ready to challenge every assertion the instructor makes contrast with 
students from other cultures who believe their aim is to transcribe every authoritative statement that is delivered. 
These voluble business students are the bane of the MBA teacher's life. They are also the people who make 
American business great.
Commercial and economic success, even in technological industries, depends not on the quality of technology, but 
on the match between technology and the needs of its customers. That is why the growing technological 
capabilities of China and India create more commercial opportunities than threats for American and European 
businesses.

It's good to head into air turbulence with a parachute. British Airways has three tucked under its seat. It is in the 
middle of merger talks with Iberia. It is thinking about teaming up with American Airlines. Now it is in merger talks 
with Australia's Qantas too. Completing just one of these deals would be pretty good; all three would be out of this 
world.
Which will it do? BA cannot prioritise any of them until it knows exactly what each deal offers and what regulators 
will allow. Talks with Iberia have already dragged on for a year. A Qantas tie-up would face different problems. To 
qualify for national carrier status, BA's routes can only be flown by a majority European-owned airline; Qantas' 
routes only by a majority Australian-owned airline. The proposed solution, a dual-listed company with two boards 
but one set of directors, promises to be a cumbersome beast.
Still, each plan has its merits. A tie-up with Iberia offers expansion into the Americas, Qantas offers a quicker entrée 
into fast-growing Asia. BA already has code-sharing with both, although deeper cultural ties with the Aussies. 
Qantas also has an appetising queue of aircraft on order, which BA could use to optimise its own fleet.
It is an enviable position for BA. Neither the Iberia nor Qantas deals are mutually exclusive. Either, or even both, 
could lead to a tie-up with American Airlines. The result would be the first truly global airline, just as exists in most 
other industries.
The need to consolidate is clear. The industry is plagued by over-capacity, even as new entrants dive-bomb the 
traditional carriers. On one side, there are deep-pocketed new entrants such as Emirates; on the other, low-cost 
carriers such as Ryanair, and even they are consolidating. Air France/KLM shows a successful cross-border airline 
merger is possible and can generate significant cost cuts too. BA's talks offer a multitude of combinations, but they 
are eventually sequenced. BA's and Iberia's share prices have rocketed on the prospect that at least one of them 
will happen.

Higher offer from Ryanair on the way? Ryanair Hike
Higher offer from Ryanair on the way?; Ryanair Hike

Highlight: A higher offer from Ryanair is being seen as a near certainty after its surprise 748m euro bid for Aer 
Lingus yesterday was rebuffed as too low.
Body
A higher offer from Ryanair is being seen as a strong possibility after its surprise 748m euro bid for Aer Lingus 
yesterday was rebuffed as too low.
Yesterday's offer was categorically condemned by trade unions at the carrier.
However, both Aer Lingus itself and the government, which owns 25pc of the carrier's shares, offered reactions that 
fell far short of an outright "no".
Aer Lingus said the offer "significantly undervalued" its worth. In a holding statement, its board strongly urged 
shareholders to take no action and said another statement would follow. For his part, transport minister Noel 
Dempsey said government aviation policy was for passengers to have competition in terms of service provision. 
"The government has the shares in Aer Lingus for strategic reasons," he said on radio. "One of the strategic 
reasons was to ensure that Aer Lingus held on to the slots at Heathrow. We also wanted to prevent hostile bids." 
However, the minister avoided rejecting the bid outright. He said he would await full details of the offer before 
making a decision. Health Minister Mary Harney, meanwhile , welcomed the bid as an "expression of confidence in 
the Irish economy" but said it would be inappropriate to comment on the government's deliberations. Sources close 
to the cabinet are, however, quoted this morning by the Irish Independent as saying that the offer would "need to be 
much larger". The SIPTU trade union, which represents ground staff at Aer Lingus , described the bid as "mischief 
making" and contradictory. Branch organiser Teresa Hannick said the move "directly contradicts all Ryanair's talk 
over the years about the necessity for competition in Ireland's airline industry". "Ryanair has established a dominant 
position and is moving to do what we always said it would -create a private sector monopoly so that it can 
absolutely dictate the agenda to the detriment of both consumers and workers." The Impact trade union, which 
represents flight staff and management at the airline, said a takeover "would be very bad news for the consumer". It 
said the removal of competition would almost certainly mean significant increases in air fares in the long term. The 
Higher offer from Ryanair on the way? Ryanair Hike
union also pointed out that the last attempt by Ryanair to take over Aer Lingus was rejected by Aer Lingus staff by a 
margin of 97 per cent. It was unlikely that the result of any new ballot would be different, it said. The cash bid by 
Ryanair of 1.40 euro per share represents a premium of approximately 28 per cent over the average closing price of 
Aer Lingus shares for the 30 days to November 28th, 2008. At that price the government would get 187m euro for 
its 25 per cent stake . However, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary did not deny a suggestion put to him 
yesterday that Aer Lingus would be a "steal" if he got it at that price. With Aer Lingus having a reported 800m euro 
in spare cash, a purchase by Ryanair at that price would leave it with more money in the bank after the transaction 
than before. Mr O'Leary said, however, that the cash reserve was "dwindling away" due to losses. Talks are 
expected between Ryanair's Michael O'Leary and government ministers, probably transport minister Noel Dempsey 
and finance minister Brian Lenihan.

Aer Lingus shares for the 30 days to November 28th, 2008. At that price the government would get 187m euro for 
its 25 per cent stake . However, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary did not deny a suggestion put to him

Body
A higher offer from Ryanair is being seen as a strong possibility after its surprise 748m euro bid for Aer Lingus 
yesterday was rebuffed as too low.
Yesterday's offer was categorically condemned by trade unions at the carrier.
However, both Aer Lingus itself and the government, which owns 25pc of the carrier's shares, offered reactions that 
fell far short of an outright "no".
Aer Lingus said the offer "significantly undervalued" its worth. In a holding statement, its board strongly urged 
shareholders to take no action and said another statement would follow. For his part, transport minister Noel 
Dempsey said government aviation policy was for passengers to have competition in terms of service provision. 
"The government has the shares in Aer Lingus for strategic reasons," he said on radio. "One of the strategic 
reasons was to ensure that Aer Lingus held on to the slots at Heathrow. We also wanted to prevent hostile bids." 
However, the minister avoided rejecting the bid outright. He said he would await full details of the offer before 
making a decision. Health Minister Mary Harney, meanwhile , welcomed the bid as an "expression of confidence in 
the Irish economy" but said it would be inappropriate to comment on the government's deliberations. Sources close 
to the cabinet are, however, quoted this morning by the Irish Independent as saying that the offer would "need to be 
much larger". The SIPTU trade union, which represents ground staff at Aer Lingus , described the bid as "mischief 
making" and contradictory. Branch organiser Teresa Hannick said the move "directly contradicts all Ryanair's talk 
over the years about the necessity for competition in Ireland's airline industry". "Ryanair has established a dominant 
position and is moving to do what we always said it would -create a private sector monopoly so that it can 
absolutely dictate the agenda to the detriment of both consumers and workers." The Impact trade union, which 
represents flight staff and management at the airline, said a takeover "would be very bad news for the consumer". It 
said the removal of competition would almost certainly mean significant increases in air fares in the long term. The

union also pointed out that the last attempt by Ryanair to take over Aer Lingus was rejected by Aer Lingus staff by a 
margin of 97 per cent. It was unlikely that the result of any new ballot would be different, it said. The cash bid by 
Ryanair of 1.40 euro per share represents a premium of approximately 28 per cent over the average closing price of

Ryanair in fresh Aer Lingus assault

Michael O'Leary is unlikely to be daunted by the rejection of his latest bid for the rival Irish carrier, writes Kevin 
Done
Body
Aer Lingus is uniquely vulnerable to Ryanair's advances, according to Michael O'Leary, in spite of the rejection of 
his latest bid last night.
The budget airline's aggressive chief executive certainly knows his Irish rival intimately. He knows where he would 
cut costs, where he would make money and where Aer Lingus loses it. And he knows how he would face down the 
notoriously truculent unions at the smaller airline, if they opposed a takeover.
"It is 100 yards away across the car park in Dublin," Mr O'Leary said yesterday. "We know it well. If we were to do 
SkyEurope [the struggling Bratislava-based low-cost airline] or some other carrier, we wouldn't know the business 
well."
With Aer Lingus he said, "We would take a short-haul high-cost carrier and make it a short-haul, much lower- cost 
carrier. And we would make money."
There is also the attraction of the strong Aer Lingus balance sheet, with EUR767m (£651m) of net cash at the end 
of September.
Buying the shares it does not already own would cost Ryanair just EUR520m - its bid values Aer Lingus' total equity 
at EUR748m. The enterprise value after operating leases is EUR281m, before unknown pension deficits.
Even the ever-confident Mr O'Leary accepted the odds of success were still carefully balanced, however. "We need 
both the government [the state owns 25 per cent] and the board. It is by no means certain, but there is a 50-50 
chance we get both."
Ryanair in fresh Aer Lingus assault
And in spite of last night's initial rejection the odds have moved in Ryanair's favour in the two years since it made its 
first abortive bid, which met solid resistance from the Irish government, trade unions and the workforce, as well as 
competition authorities in Brussels.
Since then, Mr O'Leary has kept Aer Lingus in his sights, never giving the merest hint of giving up his prey. He has 
steadily built Ryanair's Aer Lingus stake to 29.8 per cent, as the share price has languished.
He said: "The government finances are in a mess, it means deep and painful cuts in health and education. This 
[bid] offers the government EUR188m [for the remaining government stake]. This is a fantastic time to offer a way 
out. And we are offering growth and 1,000 new jobs rather than capacity cutbacks and job cuts."
Ryanair's original bid shocked the Irish government. It was launched only days after the previously state-owned 
Irish flag carrier had been successfully floated in Dublin and London in September 2006.
Yesterday, Irish ministers reacted cautiously to the latest Ryanair salvo, though there was no outright rejection. 
Noel Dempsey, transport minister, said: "We'll wait until we get the full picture, and wait until the board has had a 
chance to look at it and at that stage we'll start a consideration."
Ryanair believes the government may well be more amenable to relinquishing its 25 per cent stake with the offer of 
cash on the table and having watched Aer Lingus struggle for two years.
Aer Lingus forecasts a loss for 2008 and 2009 and its costs are much higher than Ryanair and EasyJet.
Last month Aer Lingus said itself that the business had to change fundamentally, outlining a plan to save EUR74m 
a year.
Dermot Mannion, chief executive, said it cost Aer Lingus EUR80 to produce a short-haul seat compared to EUR60 
at EasyJet and EUR40 at Ryanair, with the biggest differences in labour and sales and distribution costs. Mr 
Mannion has already been forced by union pressure to dilute the cost cutting.
Last night, Aer Lingus said it remained "a strong business with significant cash reserves and a robust future", 
saying the bid significantly undervalues the company.
Ryanair, in turn, says it could use scale and low-cost expertise to transform the airline by forcing suppliers, airports 
and maintenance providers to adopt tougher and cheaper contracts.
It is offering Aer Lingus employees a chance to cash in shares at a 25 per cent premium, alongside the prospect of 
future growth with a doubling of the short-haul fleet and 1,000 new jobs. More ominously, it gives no guarantees to 
the existing 4,200 Aer Lingus workers.
The company believes it can also make headway in Brussels, as the competitive landscape has changed. The 
original Ryanair/Aer Lingus deal is the only airline takeover ever blocked by Europe's competition authorities.
Irish competition concerns have been jettisoned in sectors such as banking and Mr O'Leary is gambling that this 
time the Irish government will prefer the gains of consolidation to competition.

Aer Lingus is uniquely vulnerable to the attack from Ryanair.
Its pursuer knows the business intimately. It knows where it would cut costs. It knows where it would make money 
and where Aer Lingus loses it. And it knows how it would face down the notoriously truculent unions at its much 
smaller rival Irish airline, if they should choose to strike to oppose an agreed takeover.
"It is 100 yards away across the car park in Dublin," said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's unremittingly aggressive chief

ran into a solid wall of resistance from the Irish government, the trades unions and the workforce, as well as the 
competition authorities in Brussels.
O'Leary goes in for the kill on vulnerable rival carrier
Mr O'Leary has remained with his tanks parked firmly in front of the Aer Lingus headquarters and has never made 
the slightest sign of going away. He has steadily built up the Ryanair stake to its present 29.8 per cent, as the Aer 
Lingus share price has fallen back.
"The government finances are in a mess, it means deep and painful cuts in health and education. This [bid] offers 
the government EUR188m [for the remaining government stake].
"This is a fantastic time to offer the government a way out. And we are offering growth and 1,000 new jobs rather 
than capacity cutbacks and job cuts."
Ryanair's original bid shocked the Irish government and was launched only days after the previously fully state-
owned Irish flag carrier had been successfully floated in Dublin and London in September 2006.
Irish ministers reacted cautiously to the latest Ryanair salvo yesterday. There was no outright rejection. Noel 
Dempsey, Irish transport minister, said: "We'll wait until we get the full picture, and wait until the board of Aer Lingus 
has had a chance to look at it and at that stage we'll start a consideration."
Ryanair believes the government may well be more amenable to relinquishing its 25 per cent stake with the offer of 
cash on the table and having watched Aer Lingus struggle for two years to go it alone.
Aer Lingus is already forecasting a loss for both 2008 and 2009, its costs are still much higher than rivals Ryanair 
and EasyJet, and Mr O'Leary believes it has been forced to capitulate again to the unions in its latest attempt to cut 
costs and to outsource a large part of its Dublin-based ground services.
Last month, it said the business had to be changed fundamentally and outlined a plan to save EUR74m a year.
Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus chief executive, said it cost Aer Lingus EUR80 to produce a short-haul seat compared 
with EUR60 at EasyJet and EUR40 at Ryanair, with the biggest differences being in labour and sales and 
distribution costs. Mr Mannion has already been forced by union pressure to dilute the cost-cutting, but Ryanair 
believes it could use its own scale and expertise to transform the airline's operation. It would force suppliers, 
airports and maintenance providers to adopt its own much tougher and cheaper contracts.
And it believes it could buy aircraft much more cheaply, whether from Boeing - it won record discounts for itself at 
the bottom of the last recession - or from Airbus, the current Aer Lingus supplier.
For Aer Lingus employees it is offering a chance to cash in their shares at a 25 per cent premium with the prospect 
of future growth with a doubling of the short-haul fleet and 1,000 new jobs. More ominously, however, it gave no 
guarantees for the existing 4,200 Aer Lingus jobs.
Mr O'Leary believes he can also make headway in Brussels, as the competitive landscape has changed 
substantially over the past two years with a wave of consolidation pending, including Lufthansa taking over 
Belgium's Brussels Airlines.
The original Ryanair/Aer Lingus deal is the only airline takeover so far to have been blocked by the European 
competition authorities.
Ryanair believes Aer Lingus cannot survive alone and that eventually it will catch its prey, giving it a stranglehold on 
its home base in Dublin.
Competition concerns have been jettisoned in sectors such as banking and Mr O'Leary is gambling that this time 
the Irish government will prefer the gains of consolidation to competition. If not, Ryanair will sit and wait a little 
longer, but its grip will not relax.

Aer Lingus last night rejected a second hostile bid in two years from Ryanair, its much bigger Irish rival.
The Irish government, which holds a 25 per cent stake, responded cautiously, in contrast to its immediate rejection 
of the first bid two years ago. Ryanair's opportunistic all-cash offer takes advantage of depressed airline stocks. It 
values Aer Lingus' equity at EUR748m (£634m).
It offered EUR1.40 a share - exactly half what it offered in its original bid in October 2006, which valued the 
company at EUR1.48bn. The new offer represented a 25 per cent premium to last Friday's closing price of 
EUR1.12. Aer Lingus had net cash in its balance sheet of EUR767m at the end of September before off balance 
sheet operating leases and restricted cash giving it an enterprise value of EUR281m.
It said last night it was "a strong business with significant cash reserves and a robust long-term future". The offer 
significantly undervalued the group, it said, and "strongly advised" shareholders to take no action.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, which already owns a 29.8 per cent stake, said he believed that in the 
midst of the current recession and with heavy pressures on the state budget there was a "50:50 chance" the Irish 
government would react more favourably to the new offer.
Noel Dempsey, Irish transport minister, said: "We'll wait until we get the full picture, and wait until the board of Aer 
Lingus has had a chance to look at it and at that stage we'll start a consideration."
Ryanair's first bid was eventually blocked in June last year by Brussels on the grounds the merged airline would 
have an dominance at Dublin airport and in the Irish market harming passenger interests. Ryanair is Europe's 
biggest low-cost carrier.
A host of other deals are going ahead including Lufthansa taking over Brussels Airlines and BMI British Midland, 
and Alitalia merging with Air One in Italy. Austrian AirlinesBritish AirwaysIberia
Aer Lingus closed 16 cents or 14 per cent higher at EUR1.28, while Ryanair fell by eight cents or 2.8 per cent to 
EUR2.85.

Banks are consolidating in the crisis. Airlines are too - Ryanair being the latest to try with its opportunistic pop at Aer 
Lingus. This is the second time the low-cost carrier has had a go at the Irish carrier, only this offer, at EUR1.40 a 
share, is half what Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, offered two years ago.
The bid puts Aer Lingus in a bind. It is small. It is loss-making. And, offering mostly short-haul European flights that 
are being chomped away by low-cost carriers, stuck in a strategic corner. Combining with a large European airline - 
like British Airways or Lufthansa - might be an alternative. But they are busy with mergers of their own.
Last time, Ryanair's bid failed following hefty opposition from Dublin and Aer Lingus staff. Eventually the European 
Union blocked the deal on competition grounds. This offer has a better chance. The financial crisis is throwing up 
combinations, like Lloyds TSB/Halifax Bank of Scotland, that wouldn't have passed muster six months ago. The 
Irish government has changed and, with a 25 per cent stake, is hungry for cash. So too, presumably, are Aer Lingus 
employee and pension funds, which own about 20 per cent and have seen the value of their holdings collapse. 
Ryanair, meanwhile, already owns almost 30 per cent. Although it has set 90 per cent shareholder acceptance as a 
condition of its bid, that rule can be waived, like last time.
Mr O'Leary envisages creating an Irish champion, operated under two separate brands, with some long-haul flights. 
Yet Ryanair could achieve that by itself. So why bother? The answer is price. Buying the shares it doesn't already 
own would cost Ryanair a mere EUR520m. Better still, given Aer Lingus's EUR800m of net cash, the deal would 
fund itself. Aer Lingus needs to revamp those old defence documents and seek a higher price.

Chief hopeful of a change of mind
Body
Irish ministers responded cautiously yesterday to Ryanair's latest hostile bid for Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, in 
sharp contrast to their immediate rejection of the first bid two years ago.
Ryanair renewed the attack on its local rival with the launch of an opportunistic all-cash offer valuing Aer Lingus's 
equity at EUR748m (m$946). The airline had net cash after operating leases of EUR467m at the end of September.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said he believed there was a good chance the Irish government would 
react more favourably to the new offer in the recession and with pressures on the state budget.
He claimed Aer Lingus' strategy for staying independent had failed in the past two years, with the carrier falling into 
loss and going through a third round of restructuring and cost cutting.
He said there was a "50/50 chance" the Irish government would change its mind.
Noel Dempsey, Irish transport minister, said: "We'll wait until we get the full picture, and wait until the board of Aer 
Lingus has had a chance to look at it, and at that stage we'll start a consideration."
Ryanair offered EUR1.40 a share for Aer Lingus, half what it offered in the original bid in October 2006, which 
valued the company at EUR1.48bn. The offer represented a 25 per cent premium to Friday's closing price of 
EUR1.12. Ryanair already holds a 29.82 per cent stake.
Ryanair's first bid ran into opposition from the government, which still holds a 25 per cent stake, and from the 
workforce - an employee share ownership trust holds 14 per cent.
It was blocked in June last year by the European competition authorities on the grounds that the merged airline 
would have an overwhelming dominance at Dublin airport and in the Irish market and would have harmed 
passenger interests.

A good deal has changed in the airline industry and world economy since Brussels took the rare step of blocking 
Ryanair's original takeover bid for Aer Lingus.
But will the changed circumstances be enough to persuade the European Commission to think differently this time?
The sticking points in June 2007 were 35 routes to and from Ireland - notably to Dublin airport - where the merger 
would have given the combined group a monopoly or a dominant position.
Ryanair offered to give up some airport slots but the Commission decided this was "unlikely to stimulate market 
entry of a size necessary to replace the competitive pressure exercised by Aer Lingus".
Ryanair's argument this time is that without its bid, Aer Lingus will remain isolated and lossmaking.
But public interest considerations are not a part of European Union merger rules and lawyers suspect that 
competition officials will need a lot of persuading before they relax their approach just because of current 
conditions.
There was no sign of a looser interpretation in the Commission's recent examination of the now abandoned 
BHP/Rio take-over bid.
Frank Fine, a competition lawyer in Brussels, says: "Everyone was looking at BHP/Rio. The Commission could 
have lightened the required divestitures, for example . . . but they didn't make things easier."
Simon Barnes of Lovells, the law firm, says: "The fact that economic times are tough doesn't mean you can do 
anticompetitive mergers."
European law allows for a "failing firm" argument but the bar is high.
The company in question must be close to collapse with no rival alternative bid that would be less anticompetitive 
available.
Sudden shift in competition headwinds is unlikely
Jonathan Gowdy of Covington & Burling, the law firm, says: "It's a very difficult proposition to satisfy."

A result is expected by this evening from the vote by SIPTU members on alternative savings at Aer Lingus to the 
company's outsourcing plan.
Ground staff at the airline, who belong to the union, have been balloting on since yesterday the savings deal 
negotiated on their behalf by the union.
The ballot is to close this afternoon, with a result expected shortly afterwards.
The union has said it does not expect the outcome to be affected by yesterday's surprise bid by Ryanair for the 
airline. SIPTU national industrial secretary Gerry McCormack said the Ryanair bid was likely to make his members 
even more determined to defend their pay and conditions. He said pledges by Ryanair ceo Michael O'Leary' 
yesterday to double Aer Lingus' short haul fleet and create 1,000 new jobs would "carry little credibility". A Ryanair 
takeover would also create a monopoly position, he said. The union would be calling on the government and the EU 
Commission, he said, to ensure competition and strategic connectivity are preserved for the Irish people.

A result is expected by this evening from the vote by SIPTU members on alternative savings at Aer Lingus to the 
company's outsourcing plan.
Ground staff at the airline, who belong to the union, have been balloting on since yesterday the savings deal 
negotiated on their behalf by the union.
The ballot is to close this afternoon, with a result expected shortly afterwards.
The union has said it does not expect the outcome to be affected by yesterday's surprise bid by Ryanair for the 
airline. SIPTU national industrial secretary Gerry McCormack said the Ryanair bid was likely to make his members 
even more determined to defend their pay and conditions. He said pledges by Ryanair ceo Michael O'Leary' 
yesterday to double Aer Lingus' short haul fleet and create 1,000 new jobs would "carry little credibility". A Ryanair 
takeover would also create a monopoly position, he said. The union would be calling on the government and the EU 
Commission, he said, to ensure competition and strategic connectivity are preserved for the Irish people.

A good deal has changed - in the airline industry and the world economy - since Brussels took the rare step of 
blocking Ryanair's last bid for Aer Lingus.
The sticking points in June 2007 were 35 routes to and from Ireland - notably to Dublin airport - where the merger 
would have given the combined group a monopoly or a dominant position.
Ryanair offered to give up some airport slots, but the European Commission decided this was "unlikely to stimulate 
market entry of a size necessary to replace the competitive pressure exercised by Aer Lingus".
Ryanair's argument this time is that without its bid, Aer Lingus will remain isolated and lossmaking.
But "public interest" considerations are not a part of EU merger rules, and lawyers suspect that competition officials 
will need a lot of persuading before they relax their approach to merger issues.
There was no sign of looser interpretation of the rules in the Commission's recent examination of the now 
abandoned BHP/Rio takeover bid.

Ryanair renews bid for Aer Lingus

Body
Budget airline Ryanair launched a new takeover bid Monday for Irish rival Aer Lingus, calculating that Ireland's 
worsening economy would soften past opposition and make a deal more likely.
Ryanair Holdings PLC said it would pay €1.40 ($1.78) a share for Aer Lingus Group PLC, a 25 percent premium 
over Monday's opening stock price but just half the price it offered two years ago. Ryanair is already the airline's 
biggest shareholder with a 30 percent stake.
The Aer Lingus board of directors rejected the new bid and urged holders of the remaining 70 percent, chiefly the 
government and Aer Lingus employees, to do likewise. Its shares rose 14.3 percent to €1.28 ($1.62) on the Irish 
Stock Exchange, while Ryanair fell 4.8 percent to €2.79 ($3.53).
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary argued that the economic and regulatory environment had changed 
drastically this year in favor of mergers. He appealed to the Irish government which retains a 25 percent stake but is 
battling its worst deficit in decades to cash in its Aer Lingus chips and encourage Ireland's two main airlines to 
combine forces.
O'Leary shrugged off the Aer Lingus rejection as irrelevant. Persuading other key shareholders was the key, he 
said.
"Our offer today is designed to appeal to the government and to the employees of Aer Lingus. We're offering an 
enormous sum of cash during a recession, but also a very bright future," the Ryanair boss said in an interview.
"We're guaranteeing to double Aer Lingus' short-haul fleet in the next five years; create a thousand new jobs for 
pilots, cabin crew, engineers, with rapid promotion; and take Aer Lingus abroad into the UK and Europe with new 
bases, just like Ryanair does." O'Leary contrasted these goals with Aer Lingus' current plans to slash 1,000 jobs 
amid rising losses.
The government firmly rejected Ryanair's surprise assault in 2006, but adopted a weaker line this time.
Ryanair renews bid for Aer Lingus
Transport Minister Noel Dempsey said the government had retained its stake specifically "to prevent hostile bids." 
But when asked, he did not rule out eventual government support for a takeover by Ryanair, which pledges to keep 
the Aer Lingus brand alive.
"Aviation policy here is that we should have competition," Dempsey said.
Together, the two airlines account for about 90 percent of all traffic in and out of the island nation. EU regulators in 
mid-2007 ruled that Ryanair's ambition to acquire Aer Lingus would create an illegal monopoly, but Ryanair is 
appealing that decision.
Ryanair's offer values Aer Lingus at €748 million ($945 million). O'Leary said the Irish government would receive 
€188 million ($238 million) from its stake, while Aer Lingus employees and pensioners who hold more than 18 
percent shares in investment trusts would gross €137 million.
Ryanair launched its initial bid for Aer Lingus in October 2006, barely a week after the government floated the state-
owned airline on the Irish and British stock exchanges.
Ryanair's then-offer of €2.80 per share was rejected by Aer Lingus unions and employees, who criticize and fear 
the consequences of Ryanair's cutthroat approach to business.
But analysts said Ryanair stood a much better chance now of persuading other shareholders to accept the offer 
because of Ireland's slide into recession and Aer Lingus' turbulent descent into the red.
Manus Cranny, analyst at MF Global Spreads in London, said O'Leary had timed the offer "incredibly" because of 
the Irish government's hunger for cash and growing fears at Aer Lingus of lost jobs and benefits. But he said 
O'Leary frightened other Aer Lingus shareholders because of his reputation as an "absolutely aggressive 
businessman running a fierce company."
Nonunion Ryanair, with 108 aircraft, continues to grow its route network and fleet and retains a cash reserve 
exceeding €2 billion. Aer Lingus, by contrast, has reversed its expansion plans into the United States and warns it 
faces growing losses unless labor unions agree to slash employee costs.
Aer Lingus reached a tentative deal last month with Ireland's largest union, SIPTU, that defused a strike threat by 
ground staff. But negotiations still loom with other unions representing pilots and cabin crew over plans to cut jobs, 
outsource some operations to non-unionized workers in Ireland, and operate trans-Atlantic services with American 
flight crews.

The Dublin shares market bucked the trend across Europe and made modest gains as shares in Aer Lingus soared 
by 15pc on Ryanair's new offer.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 7.69 points to 2,546.18.
Aer Linguse shares jumped this morning after Ryanair launched a new all-cash takeover bid for the former state 
owned carrier. Its shares rose by 16c to E1.28 while Ryanair's own shares dropped by 7c to E2.87.
The European Commission rejected Ryanair's 2006 offer on the grounds it would create a near-monopoly in 
European flights out of Dublin. This time, analysts believe a recent spate of airline mergers means the chances of 
success are greater, even if a takeover would still prove highly contentious in Ireland. Ryanair, which already owns 
29.82pc of Aer Lingus, said the all-cash offer at E1.40 per share represented a 28pc premium over the average 
closing price for Aer Lingus shares in the 30 days to Nov. 28, 2008. Aer Lingus, which strongly opposed the last 
approach from its neighbour at Dublin Airport, said shareholders should take no action pending further 
announcements by the company. The Government this morning said that it is evaluating the offer. Elsewhere, 
banking stocks put in a mixed performance with AIB shares up 5c to E2.75, Bank of Ireland dropped by 1c to E1.45, 
Anglo Irish declined by 8c to E0.77 and Irish Life and Permanent edged up 3c to E1.71. Irish banks will move in the 
coming weeks to facilitate investments of up to E10 billion in fresh capital from government, private equity and other 
sources, the Irish Examiner reported. The newspaper, which did not cite its sources, said the investments could 
also come from pension funds and individual investors. Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said after talks with bank 
executives on Friday that state involvement would be weighed on a case-by-case basis and that the government 
had not proposed consolidation in the sector. Fitch has placed AIB's Polish asset, Bank Zachodni WBK's long-term 
and short-term issuer default ratings on rating watch negative - this follows a similar move against AIB. Shares in 
food group, Aryzta, rose by 57c to E21.50 after it achieved underlying growth of 4.2pc in its European food sales in

the quarter to October, despite a fall in sales in Ireland and the UK. The reduction in UK and Irish business 
contributed to an overall slowdown in the European figure. However, the group has posted accelerated revenue 
growth in North America, with an underlying increase of 19.5 per cent for the quarter. Shares in fellow food firm, 
Origin Enterprises, surged by 27c to E1.82 after it reported first-quarter group revenue of E424.7 million, an 
increase of 71.7pc. The company stated that results for the first quarter are ahead of the prior year reflecting 
positive growth momentum in the Agri-Nutrition division along with contribution from Masstock, the group's 
integrated on-farm agronomy business, acquired in February 2008. The company also said that approximately 20pc 
of the annual profits are typically earned in the first quarter of the financial year.

The Dublin shares market fell despite a 15pc surge in Aer Lingus shares as European indices slumped following a 
string of negative economic indicators.
The index declined by 31.81 points to 2,506.68.
Aer Linguse shares jumped after Ryanair launched a new all-cash takeover bid for the former state owned carrier. 
Its shares rose by 16c to E1.28 while Ryanair's own shares dropped by 14c to E2.79.
The European Commission rejected Ryanair's 2006 offer on the grounds it would create a near-monopoly in 
European flights out of Dublin. This time, analysts believe a recent spate of airline mergers means the chances of 
success are greater, even if a takeover would still prove highly contentious in Ireland. Ryanair, which already owns 
29.82pc of Aer Lingus, said the all-cash offer at E1.40 per share represented a 28pc premium over the average 
closing price for Aer Lingus shares in the 30 days to Nov. 28, 2008. Aer Lingus, which strongly opposed the last 
approach from its neighbour at Dublin Airport, said shareholders should take no action pending further 
announcements by the company. The Government said that it is evaluating the offer. Elsewhere, banking stocks put 
in a weak performance with AIB shares down 13c to E2.57, Bank of Ireland dropped by 2c to E1.42, Anglo Irish was 
flat at E0.85 and Irish Life and Permanent edged up 2c to E1.70. Irish banks will move in the coming weeks to

Ryanair has this morning launched a new all-cash offer to buy rival carrier Aer Lingus, offering 1.40 euro for each 
share of the former state airline.
The low cost carrier , which already owns 29.82 percent of Aer Lingus after an earlier takeover bid was blocked by 
the European Union, said the offer represented a 28 percent premium over the closing price of Aer Lingus shares 
for the 30 days to 28 November.
It said the offer is being made through a wholly-owned subsidiary called Coinside.
"The Board of Ryanair proposes to merge the two airlines into one strong Irish airline group under common 
ownership," it said in a statement this morning. "Similar to previous European airline mergers such as Air 
France/KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss, both airlines will operate as separate companies, with distinctive brands, thereby 
preserving the best features of both, including Ryanair's low fare, high punctuality operations, and Aer Lingus' 
special brand, service culture as well as its long haul operations." Ryanair has requested an early meeting with the 
Chairman and Board representatives of Aer Lingus, as well as its ESOT trustees, to explain the benefits of the offer 
for the Aer Lingus business and its employees. It says these will include - the ESOT and employee shareholders 
receiving over 137m euro in cash - a commitment to double the size of the Aer Lingus short haul fleet, from 33 to 66 
aircraft over the next 5 years, thereby creating 1,000 new jobs in Aer Lingus during that period - better promotion 
prospects for Aer Lingus employees through this rapid growth - improved job security as part of one strong Irish

is an isolated, uncompetitive, loss making EU flag carrier which has been bypassed by accelerating EU wide airline 
consolidation". It adds: "Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus needs to find a strong airline partner to secure its future."

UK markets start the week on a glum note against a background of more gloomy forecasts on the recession outlook 
from manufacturers, retailers and housing surveys.
Despite predictions of another base rate cut of up to 1% on Thursday the FTSE 100 index at 8.45 am was down 60 
points at 4,228 and the Mid-250 index was 87 points weaker at 6,006.
Mining shares were the hardest hit with further ferrochrome production cuts knocking 44p from Xstrata at 886.5p 
and falling metal prices undermining Fresnillo at 143.7p, Lonmin 804.5p, Kazakhmys 247p and Anglo American 
£14.61, off 10.4p to 73p.
London Stock Exchange was another prominent weak spot at 578p, down 31p, following a Times report suggesting 
that it is losing business to rival trading platforms.
Fresh evidence consumers were unimpressed with the swathe of price cuts in the high street overshadowed 
retailers where Next lost 43p to £10.65, Marks & Spencer 5.25p to 220.5p and KIingfisher 4p to 116p.
Banks were unsettled by news that London Scottish Bank had appointed administrators, with Barclays 5.5p easier 
at 164p and insurances reflected the general dull tone of the market with Prudential 10.25p easier at 327p.
Among those to resist the trend were Thomas Cook at 164.3p, up 1.6p, after signing a £7 million sponsorship deal 
with Chelsea and ahead of tomorrow's trading update and favourable weekend press comment underpinned 
Imperial Tobacco at £16.29.
Housebuilders continued to rally on the prospect of another cut in mortgage rates, with Taylor Wimpey another 
0.75p better at 11.75p on debt refinancing hopes.
Victrex plunged 29%, or 149p to 367p after a profits warning, prompting Cazenove to downgrade its rating for in-line 
from outperform.
A Merrill Lynch rating downgrade contributed to a 80p fall in Intertek at 675p and Aberdeen Asset Management 
shed 5p to 85p in response to in-line figures.
A cautious review of the pubs sector from Morgan Stanley overshadowed Mitchells & Butlers at 157p, JD 
Wetherspoon 288.75p and Punch Taverns 119p, between 5p and 11.5p lower.
Monday Morning Market: Glum start to week as recession gloom deepens
Land of Leather jumped 5p to 11.5p after confirming several bid approaches and Aer Lingus hardened 0.23p to 
1.35p following a merger proposal from Ryanair.
An upbeat trading statement boosted Research Now 25p to 262.5p, but profit alerts unnerved Metalrax at 6p and 
Essentially 5.75p, both almost 2p adrift.
New Star Asset Management dipped 2.5p to 11.75p as talks with its bankers continued. The stock exchange 
refused the company's request for a share suspension.
JJB Sports dipped 3.5p to 22.5p as it assigned leases of four stores to Sports Direct to reduce debt.

Budget airline Ryanair has announced a new takeover bid for its Irish rival, Aer Lingus.
Ryanair says it will pay €1.40 ($1.78) a share for the remaining 70 percent of Aer Lingus, a 28 percent premium 
over the current stock price. Ryanair initially tried to acquire Aer Lingus two years ago and already owns 30 percent 
of Aer Lingus shares.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Monday he is seeking urgent meetings with the Irish government, 
which still owns 25 percent of Aer Lingus shares. Ryanair's previous bid for Aer Lingus was blocked by the Irish 
government, Aer Lingus employees who hold more than 25 percent of shares, and European Union competition 
authorities.

Ryanair subsidiary Coinside has launched a new cash offer for Irish airline Aer Lingus at 1.4 per share, half the 
previous offer of 2.8 per share in 2006.
Ryanair already owns a stake of approximately 29.82% in the airline.
'This proposed merger of Ryanair and Aer Lingus will form one Irish airline group with the financial strength to 
compete with Europe's 3 major airline groups - Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa,' said Ryanair's chief 
executive Michael O'Leary.
The comment suggests that O'Leary thinks the regulatory environment has changed since the European 
Competition Commission blocked his last bid.
He said the world has changed dramatically over the past two years, as high oil prices and deep recession have 
caused a flood of airline bankruptcies, consolidations and capacity cutbacks.
'Aer Lingus, as a small, stand alone, regional airline has been marginalised and bypassed as most other EU flag 
carriers consolidate,' said O'Leary.
The offer values the entire issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus at around 748 million and represents a 28% 
premium over the average closing price for the 30 days to 28 November 2008 and a 25% premium to last Friday's 
closing price. But it is significantly below the high in Aer Lingus' share price of over 3.00 in December 2006.
Ryanair has requested an early meeting with the chairman and board representatives of Aer Lingus to explain the 
benefits Ryanair believes will flow to the Aer Lingus business and its employees from this proposed merger.
It said it is committed to double the size of the Aer Lingus' short haul fleet to 66 from 33 aircraft over the next 5 
years and said this will lead to 1,000 new jobs in Aer Lingus
Ryanair said it has also requested early meetings with the minister for finance and the minister for transport to 
outline what it believes are the benefits for the Irish government and consumers.
Ryanair described its offer as generous, give the fall in Aer Lingus load factors and expected full year losses and 
falling share prices.
Ryanair makes new offer for Aer Lingus
Ryanair said Aer Lingus' management has failed to deliver on the promises it made when it refused Ryanair's 
previous offer in December 2006.
RBS analyst Andrew Lobbenberg thinks the latest offer has a higher chance of success than the last one. However 
he still only gives it a 50% chance of getting through.
Lobbenberg still expects competition challenges and labour opposition, despite O'Leary's attempts to reassure staff 
that their fortunes would be better at an enlarged group than with a loss-making Aer Lingus.
'We see this bid as having a better chance of approval given the flow of mergers and approvals of state aid within 
the sector, as well as recent combinations of businesses in financial services, that would never have passed 
competition authority scrutiny only three months ago,' he said.
Lobbenberg also believes the Irish government will be less virulent in its opposition to the deal this time around.
'The current leadership is not weighed down by the need to maintain the approval of Aer Lingus staff. It is, however, 
hungry for cash,' he said.
He expects Aer Lingus to reject the offer as the management and the board would prefer to remain independent. 
Given the cash on the balance sheet, he expects others to seek a higher price.
He does not expect a rival offer for Aer Lingus.

Ryanair has slammed the 'farcical situation' at Newquay regional airport in Cornwall in England that will close the 
airport from today.
Cornwall County Council, which owns the civilian airport, was due to take over the adjacent RAF St Mawgan site 
tomorrow.
But the council failed to get the necessary Civil Aviation Authority licence as new air traffic facilities were not ready.
Airlines affected by this closure are Air Southwest, Skybus and Ryanair. Ryanair has until further notice cancelled 
all future flights from Newquay Airport and spokesman Stephen McNamara said: "The situation at Newquay has 
descended into farce." The airport's biggest operator, Air South West, said it would be running all its Newquay 
flights from Plymouth Airport in Devon instead.

Can a protectionist stance be taken in regard to Irish goods? Can today's consumer be loyal to Irish goods purely 
on the basis of the greater good of sustaining Irish growth and protecting industries?
Ideally, yes. However, it is more complex than that, and than it was when 'Buy Guaranteed Irish' was a prevalent 
slogan in the 1970s and 80s. What is different this time round?
Irish consumers have lived through the 'live now, pay later' period of what then seemed like unstoppable growth. 
Consumer expectations expanded, Irish consumers shopped abroad regularly and were happy to buy products from 
different origins. It portrayed them as well travelled and sophisticated.
Then, challenger brands were welcomed in certain categories (Ryanair included), as they allowed us to spend even 
more on the products of choice and brands of distinction. We felt savvy, and the Irish attribute of tracking down a 
bargain was applauded.
We started to become more aware of the extent to which we were bring ripped off by indigenous brands and 
services. Media - and online - helped us to get more clued up about the cost of products. Just before the economic 
climate changed, we started to become more aware of ethical consumption and sustainability.
Food miles and how ethical products were became a purchasing criteria for a sizeable segment of progressive 
consumers. Local produce was favoured, as were in-season products, even if they cost more.
The recent economic downturn changed everything. Our behaviour is now influenced by price, according to more 
than 80 per cent of consumers. Discounters have doubled their share of the Irish grocery market. Thrift is a new 
form of sophistication. 'Homedulgence' (the stay-at-home-and-indulge culture) is in, again.
That said, realism is not the norm. Consumers are used to their treats. In reality, brands that deliver optimism and 
make the day better, yet are not overcharging, are adding value, delivering little moments of satisfaction, little 
acceptable rewards that will win.
Is buying Irish back on the cards?
The new middle market is brands that offer value, ensure consumers feel good about themselves, good about their 
choices, less paranoid about their fears, help them enjoy themselves a little more, but in a discrete way. Local 
products can do that if properly positioned. Brand trust is key, as is innovation and a relevant product truth. 'Local' 
must equal better, and not just be Irish. In Britain, Sainsbury's communicates that its beef is 100 per cent British.
The recent Carling campaign talks about the British grain; these are ways into the 'British' market and are credible 
as they are based on product truths Therefore, 'Buy Irish' may evolve to support local credentials (be that 
ingredients, understanding, techniques, supporting communities or people connection) and must really focus on 
how this translates for its audience.
There is a lot of opportunity for food brands and some key services brands to get this right. The smarter ones will 
get it. If they can do so at thin a competitive price, they will succeed.

Highlight: The Undercover Economist
Body
Anyone wondering how consumers behave in a recession need simply trawl the tabloids for inspiration. According 
to The Sun, sales of aphrodisiacs are up and so are sales of maternity dresses: not everything turns down in tough 
times, it seems. Elle Macpherson's underwear is said to be doing well; so too is the budget store Poundland. Some 
stories seem contradictory: one newspaper claims that Ryanair is set to make a profit, while another reports that 
weekend breaks to European cities are no longer in demand. Other stories are frankly bizarre: the crunch is alleged 
to have given a fillip to sales of cake, wooden "gravestones", West End musicals and tickets to see the film Mamma 
Mia!
The quality press has not resisted the temptation to join in the guessing game: The Economist imagined the return 
of the nutritious fish snoek, while this paper found evidence that physiotherapists were in demand to perk up 
stressed City workers.
All this speculation is an engaging diversion, but tells us little. Even the more solid reports are often based on 
anecdotes; many are simply spin or wishful thinking. I've heard a food retailer muse that Fairtrade-branded goods 
are recession-proof, because once people have seen the light about the importance of fair trade, they never turn 
back. A travel industry expert told me that the worse things get, the more people feel in need of a holiday. Perhaps 
he is right. I wouldn't bet on it.
I doubt that these early reports will tell us much about what will happen in the trough of this recession. One of the 
reasons people curtail their spending is because they lose their jobs.
But unemployment is not yet especially high: it was higher in late 2006 than in September this year. There is plenty 
of scope for things to worsen on that score.
Economic theory tells us that consumers should cut back their spending if they believe that their earning power will 
fall for an extended period of time, but if they believe the hard times are temporary - say, a short period out of work - 
they should "smooth" by borrowing in hard times and paying back when things pick up. Because of smoothing, 
consumption should not shrink as much as the economy does. That sounds reassuring, but Ray Barrell of the 
National Institute of Economic and Social Research has two pieces of bad news.
What Will We Buy To Help Us Through Hard Times?
The first is that this is the wrong sort of recession: because it was precipitated by a banking crisis, consumption may 
well fall much more dramatically. That's plausible. Consumers who want to smooth consumption can't borrow to do 
so. This is what happened during the 14 banking crises in various high-income countries that Barrell and his 
colleagues have studied.
The second piece of bad news relates to the first. Because consumers were already borrowing heavily in the good 
times, both credit constraints and a long overdue realism are likely to bite all the more deeply. That, too, is a 
tendency Barrell finds in the data.
Of course, as the sellers of herbal Viagra are said to be discovering, when consumer spending falls, some products 
do well and others do very badly. Nervous retailers looking for clues might wish to pick up research from the 1990s 
by the economists Martin Browning and Thomas Crossley, called "Shocks, Stocks and Socks". They found that 
when people are unemployed they save money in a logical way, by not buying "small durables" such as socks, and 
indeed clothes in general. In the short term, people get by and save about 15 per cent of their household budget. 
When they find a new job, they replace the tired old socks. Bad news for Marks & Spencer; good news for sellers of 
needles and thread.

European equity markets rose yesterday, helped by gains in the battered banking sector, but overall trading was 
thin with the US closed for the Thanksgiving holiday.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 2.6 per cent to 852.38.
Banks were among the day's top gainers. Belgium's Fortis jumped 17.4 per cent to EUR0.70, helped by bargain 
hunting. Dealers said Fortis was trading below its lowest possible net asset value. Buyers may have also have been 
encouraged by the European Commission's decision to extend the review of a takeover bid by BNP Paribas to buy 
Fortis.
BNP Paribas  climbed 7.4 per cent to EUR43.40 after Dresdner Kleinwort said it was better placed to weather the 
downturn than its peers in the French banking sector, Credit Agricole , up 3.2 per cent at EUR8.35, and Société 
Générale.
Société Générale , meanwhile, gained 8.5 per cent at EUR33.78. Keefe Bruyette and Woods reiterated an 
"outperform" recommendation following meetings with the bank's chief financial officer.
Among oil stocks, Norway's StatoilHydro  rose 3.8 per cent to NKr123.0 and Austria's OMV added 2 per cent at 
EUR19.89 while Portugal's Galp Energia rose 1.2 per cent to EUR8.50.
Miners and metal producers also gained, defying the recent flow of negative news from the sector. Sharp falls in 
metals prices and the deteriorating outlook for demand have forced many producers to cut output. Norwegian 
aluminium producer Norsk Hydro  rose 13 per cent to Nkr26.0, French miner Eramet added 15.9 per cent to 
EUR144.90, while German steelmaker Salzgitter jumped 11.3 per cent to EUR55.16.
Air Berlin added 15.3 per cent at EUR3.46 after the German budget carrier reported better-than-expected third-
quarter results.
Banks fare best in thin trading
Elsewhere in the sector, Germany's Lufthansa  rose 1.3 per cent to EUR10.325, Air France-KLM  edging 0.6 per 
cent lower to EUR9.825 and Ryanair , the Irish budget carrier, gained 2 per cent at EUR2.957.

Aviation history is littered with failed low fare long-haul services, but that is little deterrent
Body
The aviation landscape is littered with the jetsam of failed attempts to launch low fare, long-haul scheduled air 
services, but the industry's track record has not deterred AirAsia X from entering the fray.
Ventures such as Freddie Laker's Skytrain in the 1970s and the US carrier Peoplexpress in the 1980s to the recent 
start-ups Oasis Hong Kong and Zoom Airlines, have all collapsed.
Low fare is easy. It is low cost that is the problem, coupled with the enormous pressure that can be exerted on start-
up airlines by the incumbent full service network carriers.
Traditionally, long-haul scheduled airlines make all their profits from the front of the aircraft, from their premium 
business class passengers, whose inflated fares subsidise very low prices at the back of the plane in the economy 
cabin.
Without the business cabins, low-cost rivals have found it hard to make money.
The failure rate does not stop aviation pioneers from dreaming, however. The promise of a low cost, long-haul 
service exercises a powerful attraction on the imaginations of some of the most successful practitioners of the well-
proven short-haul low cost business model.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ireland's Ryanair, the market leader in Europe, said recently he had a business 
plan in the drawer ready to go, but he believed it could only be put into operation if he was able to buy a fleet of 
wide-body jets at rock bottom prices.
The recession may be playing into his hands, as the market for new aircraft softens.
AirAsia X is chasing the long-haul dream
The business would operate direct, point-to-point services and would not engage in connecting flights through the 
Ryanair European bases in order to avoid the complexity and costs of the existing network carriers, which feed 
traffic across their main hubs.
While Mr O'Leary looks west from Europe he has been beaten to the punch in Asia by one of his most -successful 
imitators, Tony Fernandes, the founder of AirAsia, which began regional short-haul services from Kuala Lumpur in 
2001 and has already grown to a fleet of 87 single aisle jets. Beyond Malaysia it also has affiliate airlines in 
Indonesia and Thailand.
His original dream was low cost, long-haul, however, and a year ago he began to put it into operation with the 
launch of flights by -AirAsia X.
He also offers premium seats at the front of the cabin, but he insists he is sticking zealously to the bible of low cost 
operation. There is no interlining of traffic with all the complexity of passenger and baggage transfers at a hub 
airport. If passengers connect they do it themselves, book two separate flights and collect and check in baggage 
themselves.
There are no free lounges. Food and drink are bought on board, and above all he is aiming to "sweat the assets" in 
unprecedented fashion, by attempting to get 18-and-a-half hours daily utilisation out of his aircraft. The aircraft 
makers say even the most ambitious long-haul airlines have only achieved up to 17 hours hitherto and the norm 
would be more like 15 hours.
Mr Fernandes claims the model is already proving itself in Asia on flights of 7-8 hours. The next challenge is to 
bring it to Europe. The London / Kuala Lumpur -service is being launched initially with five flights a week with one 
aircraft leased from Air Canada, but it is expected to become a daily service when a second aircraft is -procured 
next year.
Mr Fernandes said the eventual vision was to seek to operate a virtual shuttle between Stansted and Kuala Lumpur 
with as many as five flights a day drawing feeder traffic from elsewhere in Europe and Asia.

No-frills airline, Ryanair, today said it has opened its sixth route from London Gatwick, challenging British Airways 
and EasyJet.
The Irish airline launched a new daily service to and from Dusseldorf (Weeze) starting from January 7.
This follows Ryanair's recent announcement of routes to Barcelona (Girona) and Alicante.
It said it secured additional Gatwick slots following the "collapse of a number of high cost airlines" operating from 
the airport.

Sir Stelios spells out fears for EasyJet

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder and largest shareholder in EasyJet, yesterday dug in his heels in his public 
disagreement with the rest of the airline's board over its future growth strategy in the midst of the deepening 
recession.
In an interview with the Financial Times, he said he was engaging with other shareholders and with financial 
analysts to explain his concern that the group was not sufficiently focused on conserving cash and on limiting its big 
capital expenditure commitments. The group's leading institutional investors include Standard Life, Wellington, 
Fidelity and Schroders.
"The real issue is the Airbus contract," he said, under which EasyJet is committed to taking delivery of 109 new 
A320 family short-haul jets during the next four years with a total value of $5.1bn (£3.4bn) at list prices before heavy 
discounts.
"I am keen to focus the debate on how much they cost, and how they are to be paid for, rather than on passenger 
numbers," he said.
Sir Stelios, who founded EasyJet in 1995, has been a pioneer, alongside Ireland's Ryanair, of the low-cost business 
model in Europe. It has been built on capturing large chunks of market share from the legacy carriers as well as on 
stimulating market growth by offering much lower fares and by having a lower cost base than the traditional airlines.
The rapidly expanding low-cost carriers have traditionally been given a valuation premium as growth stocks, but Sir 
Stelios said he believed this era was over. "At the heart the question is are we a growth company or a mature 
company. I think it [EasyJet] is a mature company."
EasyJet management, backed by the rest of the board, said last week it was already taking a cautious approach, 
but Sir Stelios, a non-executive director, told investors he believed that the group's approach was "based on 
optimistic assumptions about future revenues".
EasyJet's shares are down 5 per cent since the row emerged a week ago.
Sir Stelios spells out fears for EasyJet
Yesterday, Sir Stelios expressed the concern that low-cost airlines were not recession-proof like low-cost food 
stores such as Wal-Mart, Aldi or Lidl.
He feared the customers would not be there to fill all the "aluminium tubes" on order from Airbus. "Anyone just 
unemployed must still go to Aldi to buy the cheapest food to survive," he said, "but he does not need to go for a 
stag party to Prague with his mates."

I wonder are we all getting a little bit crankier as the recession bites?
The latest bulletin from the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland (ASAI) suggests that industry players are less 
inclined than usual to let any slippage in communications by anyone else pass unnoticed.
Most of the complaints investigated - and largely upheld - by the ASAI in the past few months came from a 
competitor or officialdom, rather than a member of the public.
There were eight such complaints in the period under review, compared with five consumer complaints plus one 
extra judgment regarding a slimming ad, which the ASAI followed up off its own bat.
Lidl was rapped on the knuckles for including a price promotion on beer in a leaflet about 'back-to-school offers', 
while Danone was accused by rival Glanbia of making what Glanbia said were unwarranted health claims for its 
products.
Although Danone cited extensive research to support its claims, the ASAI stipulated that, since none of the 
research had been published in ''peer-reviewed journals'', it didn't come up to the standard required.
Ryanair was criticised for featuring a photograph of a Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat in an 
advertisement with a headline that began with the word 'DOPES'.
The RNLI took offence and said the image was used without its approval and was offensive.
Ryanair, cocking its usual snook at advertising regulations, did not even bother to respond. One could argue that 
the RNLI is being over-sensitive here: it seems far-fetched to imagine that the reputation of this organisation could 
be affected one way or the other by something as frivolous as a Ryanair ad.
But this is fundraising season and times are tough, and the RNLI doubtless felt it was best not to take any chances.
Media world: A new silly season of complaints is upon us
It was a Halifax customer, rather than a rival, who exposed the limitations of the bank's amusing 'Show me the 
money' ads for an easy access savings account. This implied that the bank would hand customers cash from their 
savings without any fuss, unlike most institutions.
In fact, it turned out that Halifax staff were not allowed to hand out any more than EUR 1,800 in cash in any one 
transaction. The complaint was upheld, as the ASAI pointed out the fact that the savings could be accessed 
instantly online made no difference.
It must be hard for the ASAI to keep a straight face at times.
Among the complaints upheld on this occasion was one against a circus that was advertising itself as having newly 
arrived from Australia, on its ''first-ever'' visit here.
In fact, it seemed that the Australian Super Circus Sydney was permanently based in Ireland, had been for a while, 
and the owners were originally from Germany.
The circus responded, after numerous requests, to clarify that its owner, Alexander Scholl, ''had relatives in 
Australia'' and while it was not new to Ireland, the circus was in fact new to Tallaght, so its advertising was not 
incorrect. Nice try . . .

Aer Lingus bullish on benefit of cuts

Aer Lingus sees itself as an ''acquirer and not an acquiree'' in the shake-up of the global airline sector following the 
provisional agreement of cost-cutting proposals with trade unions.
A senior company source said Aer Lingus had considered the possibility of acquiring another airline and was 
''keeping an eye on continuing developments'' in the sector. However, he acknowledged that the airline must first 
''get its own house in order'' in terms of costs.
''We have a strong balance sheet of  800 million, and we see ourselves as an acquirer and not an acquiree," the 
source said. ''We are not at the forefront of anything at the moment, but may be in this position when cost savings 
are incurred."
Aer Lingus hopes to save  25 million after agreeing the cost cuts with Siptu last week. In a bid to attract more 
business customers, the airline now plans to upgrade the business class sections of its fleet to the level of 
competitors such as British Airways.
However, some industry experts question whether the company can remain independent. Joe Gill, aviation analyst 
with Bloxham Stockbrokers, said the long-term viability of the airline could only be guaranteed by a merger with a 
''strategic partner'' such as Air France, KLM or Ryanair.
''This would effectively be a takeover, but the shareholders, unions and government [which owns a 2 5 per cent 
stake in Aer Lingus] would likely be opposed to this," said Gill. He believes the airline should not add new routes 
and should focus on cost-cutting.
Gill said that Aer Lingus needed to make savings of  160 million in order to reduce its current cost per passenger 
from  80 to  60. Ryanair's comparable cost per passenger is just  40.
''If they can get those costs down, they could have a fighting chance with a model like EasyJet, which offers that bit 
better of a service compared to Ryanair," he said. ''Aer Lingus is going through a torturous process with unions, and 
Aer Lingus bullish on benefit of cuts
it is very difficult for all parties to get to a level position, but the company's ability to survive competitively is 
weakened over the longer term if the challenge of major cost cuts is not addressed."
While Gill said Aer Lingus was benefiting from the falling cost of oil, he warned that all airlines were vulnerable to 
future price hikes. Seán Murphy, spokesman for the Air Transport Users Council, said he believed it was possible 
for Aer Lingus to turn its fortunes around.
''Ryanair is growing in the midst of a recession and Aer Lingus proved their ability to turn things round previously 
under Willie Walsh," Murphy said. ''He took the costs down and drove occupancy up, and that is what has to be 
repeated now."
The main challenge facing Aer Lingus, he said, came from industry ''giant'' Ryanair, which had a lower cost per 
seat, higher occupancy rates and newer aircraft. ''Because of the competition they are facing from them [Ryanair] 
on short routes, long-haul offers the main potential to recover this revenue, but occupancy rates are dropping on 
these flights."
Murphy said that Aer Lingus employees - who own 15 per cent of the airline - ''don't seem to have grasped'' the 
benefits of making the airline more profitable. The employees had threatened to strike over proposals to outsource 
jobs before last week's agreement on the cost cuts.
Under the agreement, there will be a 7 per cent reduction in staff through voluntary redundancies, and new recruits 
will have a reduced gross salary. Current staff will maintain pay and conditions, but have to take on new 
''efficiencies'' in work practices.
A ballot of 1,700 members before December 3 will decide whether the moves will be accepted. One union source 
said that generous redundancy terms and the current economic downturn might force acceptance. Siptu said the 
moves would save Aer Lingus  25 million.
The airline is still in negotiations with the Impact trade union, which represents pilots and some cabin crew, about 
saving another  10 million. It is also seeking to save the same amount in a pay freeze, and plans to save a further  
24million by retiring one long-haul plane and cutting consultancy fees and advertising.
Aer Lingus management has warned that the airline stands to lose more than  20 million this year, and is expected 
to have further losses in 2009.
It has also estimated that the  10 Irish airport travel tax, announced in last month's budget, will cost the airline  30 
million next year.
An Aer Lingus spokesman said the airline was ''going after business in a competitive environment'' and that 
customers were very price-conscious. He said securing the cost savings ''through whatever means necessary'' was 
a priority for the airline.
''We are meeting Impact again next week, but the cogs are turning a little slower there," he said. ''We hope they can 
take a lead from Siptu. The issue of outsourcing jobs is still a live one until we get cost-saving agreements across 
the board."

Ireland has had an exceptional few years.
We have enjoyed over a decade of rapid economic growth, social progress, infrastructural development and an 
improved standard of living.
What makes this all the more exceptional is that it was achieved without the help of brilliant leadership or 
particularly innovative policies.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said last week that history would prove Bertie Ahern to have been a ''useless 
wastrel'' who ''squandered the wealth of a generation''. You could be forgiven for dismissing this as just more 
populist rhetoric by the maverick multi-billionaire airline boss. But you may want to take a look at the evidence first.
In normal circumstances, the rule is: no top ten lists before the first weekend in December. But since the fairy lights 
on the Christmas tree on O'Connell Street have been ratcheting up the city council's electricity bill for several weeks 
already, I find myself in an unusually festive mood. So here is my own personal Christmas top ten: the Lost Billions 
hitlist.
It could have been longer, but it's still early days to quantify things like the eventual cost of the lack of planning of 
the Dublin commuter belt, the cost/ convictions ratio that will ultimately be delivered by the tribunals, and the long-
term impact of the government's continued support for the collapsing building industry. Other things, like the 
integrated ticketing system for Dublin transport, which is running four years and  20 million over budget, didn't make 
the cut either. Maybe next year.
The Celtic tiger years were characterised by huge sums of money being poured down a black hole on wasteful 
and misbegotten projects. Here are ten of the best
(This list is best enjoyed with a glass of mulled wine as you hum ''Where did you go to, my lolly?" to the tune of the 
old Peter Sarstedt ballad. Actually, make mine a brandy.)
1. National Aquatic Centre With a price tag of  62 million, it's a drop in the deep end beside the proposed IR£550 
million Bertie Bowl - and it did at least get built. But its labyrinthine catalogue of difficulties has made it a more fitting 
monument to Celtic tiger Ireland than its creators might ever have imagined. Seven months after it opened its 
doors, its roof blew off. But that was only the beginning of its troubles. It has been the subject of several prolonged 
court battles involving disputes over its lease, outstanding Vat payments, management issues and even its 
ownership.
Now back in the news again because the former operator, Dublin Waterworld, is to sue the builder, Bam 
Contractors, for loss of earnings. Still keeping up? No? Well, you're not alone - with the exception of Labour's Joan 
Burton, neither is any of the Opposition, which is probably why the government hasn't been called to account for 
such spectacular mismanagement of public money.
2. Electronic voting The useless e-voting machines cost  51.3 million to develop - equivalent to a cervical cancer 
vaccine for every 12-year-old girl in the country for at least the next five years. And they are the gift that keeps on 
giving, at least for those paid to store them for the last four years. The average annual expenditure on storage from 
2004 to 2007 was  637,000. However, now that they are safely ensconced in the army barracks (a move which 
resulted in a transportation bill of over  300,000), the cost should drop to a more palatable  260,000.
3. Decentralisation Fine Gael's Richard Bruton estimates that  27.5 million has so far been wasted on the scheme 
to relocate 11,000 civil servants, which has now been deferred for another three years. So it's not just a waste of 
taxpayers' money - it's also a major headache for the several hundred civil servants who have already relocated as 
part of ''advance parties'' in the expectation that the rest of their office would follow, and will now probably have to 
turn around and head back to Dublin. How much is that going to cost in compensation?
4. PPARS payroll system The electronic payments system for the HSE cost  150 million and was so revolutionary 
that only four people knew how to use it.
5. Bertie Ahern's new Molesworth Street office The bill for the three-week cleaning, furnishing and general tarting 
up of the ex-taoiseach's office this summer was  220,000,or around  10,000 per day. No mean achievement for a 
man who prides himself on his appreciation of the simple things in life.
6. Helicoptergate Of course,  18.7 million is peanuts compared to some of the more spectacular examples of 
squandering taxpayers' money, but the sale of four Irish defence force helicopters to a US company for just  
300,000, after which they were repaired and sold onto the Chilean navy for nearly  19 million, must rank among the 
most gobsmackingly stupid wastes of public finances.
The government claims that it made more economic sense to sell on rather than repair the helicopters, which were 
totally unsuitable for troop transport, but military analysts question why they were bought at all if they really are little 
more than airborne limousines. Still, at least they made more for the state than the retired Nissan army jeeps - 
which were sold for 1 cent each.
7. Pulse The  61 million Pulse computer system was launched on unsuspecting gardai in 1999. Six years later, 
many members of the force had become so frustrated with constant breakdowns in the system that they'd resorted 
to using pencil and paper.
8. Luas The shiny, thrusting, testosterone-fuelled symbol of an Ireland in the throes of a midlife crisis was originally 
projected to cost  288 million, but the final budget came in at closer to  800 million. Work only started in earnest 
around the date it was supposed to open, and in the end, the small matter of bringing the green line across the 
Liffey to meet the red line never happened.
The Celtic tiger years were characterised by huge sums of money being poured down a black hole on wasteful 
and misbegotten projects. Here are ten of the best
9. Residential Institutions Redress Board An expensive deal struck behind closed doors between the state and the 
religious orders in 2002 decided that we, the taxpayers, would pay all but  128millionof compensation claims by 
victims of clerical abuse. The government claimed it believed those claims would not be more than  250 million.
They now seem set to top  1.1 billion. You might think the Church had got off lightly, but it was revealed earlier this 
year that it has been slow to deliver on its part of the deal - it still owes us almost  36million in property, the value of 
which is falling by the day.
10. Ballymun Regeneration Project It's a worthwhile project for an area in dire need of regeneration, but at  942 
million - around  500 million over budget - and at least six years behind schedule, someone wasn't doing their 
sums.
As you contemplate the roughly  3.2 billion sized hole these projects have left us in our public finances and what 
they delivered - a disjointed rail system in Dublin, a leaking swimming pool in Dublin, the partial regeneration of 
Ballymun in Dublin, and quite a few expensive computer programmes - ask yourself this: who has been held 
accountable?
Who has been fired? Then remember who gave these people their jobs in the first place, and who can take them 
away.

Aer Lingus and Ireland's largest union reached a tentative labor deal Thursday that removes the threat of an 
imminent strike from the loss-making airline.
The Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, known as SIPTU, had said its members would begin 
withdrawing from work Monday if the airline proceeded with plans to lay off unionized staff in favor of outsourced, 
nonunion workers including new cabin crews recruited in the United States.
Emerging Thursday from more than a week of negotiations, Aer Lingus chiefs and SIPTU negotiators said they had 
agreed on a compromise that would require Aer Lingus workers to accept weaker terms of employment. Aer Lingus, 
in exchange, would defer for the moment its threat to outsource some work.
SIPTU negotiator Teresa Hannick said its Aer Lingus members chiefly ground crew, baggage handlers and office 
staff would be balloted on the plans over the next week. She declined to reveal specifics of the proposed changes.
In a statement, Aer Lingus said it would set aside its outsourcing plans if SIPTU economists can demonstrate that 
Thursday's package will deliver €50 million (more than $62 million) in annual savings from the payroll.
"However, until these savings are verified and confirmed by the union, the outsourcing plans remain on the table," 
the Aer Lingus statement said.
Aer Lingus says it wants to cut 1,300 employees from its 4,300-member staff and hand over control of some 
operations particularly baggage handling in Ireland and cabin crews on its U.S. routes to nonunion workers. The 
airline says it has given its unionized employees pay increases over the past three years averaging 8 percent 
annually and this cannot continue, particularly because the company has fallen into the red this year and forecasts 
wider losses in 2009.
The airline is still in negotiations with another union, Impact, which represents pilots and flight attendants. That 
union opposes management plans to close cabin-crew bases at London's Heathrow Airport and at Shannon Airport, 
western Ireland, as well as the idea of hiring American-based cabin crew to staff Aer Lingus' trans-Atlantic services.
Aer Lingus , union reach deal to avert strike
Aer Lingus has repeatedly battled labor unions since the government privatized the state-owned airline in 2006. The 
company's biggest shareholders rival Irish airline Ryanair, Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts, and the 
government have suffered heavy losses.
On Thursday, before the labor deal was announced, Aer Lingus shares fell 4.4 percent to a new all-time low on the 
Irish Stock Exchange of €0.98 ($1.23), less than half their flotation price two years ago.

Controversial Alitalia deal to obtain government green light

Italy's centre-right government is set to approve the controversial sale of lossmaking Alitalia to a group of Italian 
investors in spite of complaints by rival airlines of illegal state aid and accusations that its assets have been 
undervalued.
Augusto Fantozzi, the administrator overseeing the flag carrier's bankruptcy, said he had received the green light 
from a government committee that had determined that the offer from Compagnia Aerea Italiana (Cai) was in line 
with market prices. Formal government approval may come as early as today.
Cai, headed by Roberto Colaninno and numbering 16 Italian businesses, says its offer is worth about EUR1bn 
($1.26bn), made up of about EUR275m in cash and the balance in taking on part of Alitalia's debt. Only EUR100m 
is to be paid up front.
Cai is acquiring Alitalia's prime assets, including 80 aircraft, the brand, its slots and traffic rights. Several thousand 
jobs will be cut. The new Alitalia will be merged with its smaller rival, Air One, giving the new airline a near 
monopoly on some routes.
Opposition politicians accuse Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, of setting up a sweetheart deal for the Italian 
consortium, which is in advanced negotiations to sell a 20 per cent stake to Air France-KLM immediately and a 
controlling stake in the longer term. Mr Berlusconi, campaigning for election last April, promised to block a takeover 
by Air France-KLM and to keep the airline in Italian hands.
The Italian media has noted that Banca Leonardo, adviser to the government on valuing the airline, has two 
members of Cai on its board, and that Antonio Tajani, European Commissioner for Transport who approved the 
conditions of the sale, is from Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.
The government owns 49.9 per cent of Alitalia. Rival airlines intend to challenge what they call illegal Italian state 
aid in the courts. Ryanair has condemned the EC decision as a "farce" and a "blatantly corrupt" decision.
Controversial Alitalia deal to obtain government green light
"Fantozzi is giving a Christmas present to Cai," commented Gianni Rossi, chief executive of Meridiana, Italy's third-
largest airline.
He told the Financial Times that Meridiana had made an offer to Mr Fantozzi for aircraft and slots at Milan's Linate 
airport, but that he got no reply.
Slots - allocations of landing and take-off times - are a legal and financial grey zone. Airlines do not own slots 
outright, but in practice they carry a market value. BMI British Midland, being bought by Lufthansa, had valued its 
slots at £770m ($1,160m).
Cai said it put a zero value on Alitalia's slots. Mr Rossi said he estimated the value of Alitalia's slots at EUR400m. A 
study by the non-profit Bruno Leoni Institute estimated EUR550m to EUR900m.
Last December Alitalia sold three pairs of slots at Heathrow, Europe's most congested airport, for EUR92m. It has 
10 more pairs.

Ryanair has threatened to close down its services to Fuertaventura - a massive holiday and golfing resort in the 
Canary Islands, unless local tourism group AIE honors the commercial agreement it entered into with Ryanair to 
promote the area as a tourist destination.
Since Ryanair began flying to Fuerteventura in 2006, annual passenger numbers have increased over one hundred

Ryanair has claimed that "blatantly unlawful" state aid of 500m euro is to be offered by the Austrian government as 
part of the sale of its stake in Austrian Airlines.
The low cost carrier today demanded that the European Commission prohibit the aid, which Ryanair says is to be 
offered from public funds to Lufthansa "on top of the gift of the government's 42pc stake in Austrian Airlines".
In a statement, the Irish airline said it "would appeal any decision by the Commission to allow this unlawful state aid 
to Lufthansa".
"The Austrian Government is so desperate to get rid of its national airline that it agreed to pay Lufthansa E500m to 
take over the Government's 42% stake in the airline," said Ryanair's director of legal affairs Jim Callaghan. "This is 
in clear violation of the EU State aid rules, as no private investor would pay 500m euro to dispose of its stake in a 
virtually bankrupt company." "We do not see private owners of the majority stake in Austrian Airlines queuing up to 
contribute hundreds of millions of euro to dispose of their shares to Lufthansa, so this is yet another case of blatant 
state aid to yet another EU flag carrier airline." "Following the Commission's ludicrous decisions last week to allow 
even more unlawful state aid to Alitalia, we have no confidence that the Commission will uphold its state aid rules 
and properly investigate this case." "However, we remain committed to exposing the Commission's continuing 
"political corruption" in the application of state aid rules."

Ryanair's press office speaks
Posted 10 November
by David Learmount
Ryanair normally has only one spokesman, chief executive Michael O'Leary. But following the Monday 10 
November overrun at Rome Ciampino, the airline has put out a statement.
It says the Boeing 737-800 suffered a multiple birdstrike on approach.
It certainly did. The evidence that the aircraft hit a flock of birds is all over the nose cone and wing leading edges.
Birdstrike alone is not an explanation of the outcome, it's a statement of some circumstances that definitely had a 
bearing on what happened. If the account is accurate, a clear description by a passenger of the aircraft beginning to 
go around followed by a rapid drop to hit the runway hard may be an indication that the captain tried to avoid the 
flock by going around, but hit many birds just the same.

Virgin america launches gogo
Posted 10 November

Virgin America will become the second US carrier to offer in-flight broadband connectivity when it launches Aircell's 
Gogo service on 22 November (or at least that's the plan).
The carrier has sent an invite to journalists to participate in a special flight above San Francisco on its beta Wi-Fi 
aircraft.
Bombs, bites and broadband INTRODUCTION:
But, "in true Virgin fashion", the airline will launch Gogo "with the first-ever live air-to-ground video transmission, 
streamed to an audience of millions both online and onstage during an event unlike any other -YouTube Live".
Press will get a shot at YouTube stardom by being part of the live broadcast from the aircraft, says the carrier. 
We're being told to bring our laptop or PDA "but no tasers bro". Darn it!

the french fry of bombs
Posted 10 November
by Stephen Trimble
The US Air Force's bombs come in roughly six sizes -- the mini (250lb or 114kg) SDB, and small (500lb), medium 
(1,000) and large (2,000lb) JDAMs. There's also the extra-large (15,000lb) Daisy Cutter and super-size (20,000lbs) 
MOAB.
One of the key frustrations in modern combat is that you'll only have a "small" 500-pounder available when you 
really need a mini or a large to, well, do the job. It's a huge problem for close air support, where a slightly errant 
500-pounder could wipe out the wrong troops.
The USAF has talked about building a "dial-a-yield" bomb since at least 2003.
A request for information dated 31 October asks industry to propose a new 500lb bomb featuring "selectable" 
modes ranging from minimum to medium to maximum. It also needs to be ready for delivery between 2012 and 
2016.

choose your own checkpoint
Posted 10 November
by David Field
Just in time for the holiday rushes, the Transportation Security Administration says it will have its so-called self-
select checkpoint lanes at all US airports by the middle of this month. This is a very good thing - if it works.
Instead of letting all airport passengers just line up and then get delayed behind the state legislator who forgets he 
has a .357 magnum in his briefcase ("darn, I forgot"), you can let people who think they know what they're doing get 
in a lane for other smart people and the people who know they don't know what they're doing get in another lane. 
And you can have a third lane for people who aren't sure where they should go. Are you following?

The Ryanair 737 came to rest almost on the threshold at the runway end
accident
Birdstrike ends in hard touchdown for Ryanair
The Ryanair Boeing 737-800 that suffered a multiple birdstrike late on final approach last week touched down with a 
high nose attitude and sink rate, according to evidence from damage to its hull and landing gear.
The 10 November accident occurred at Rome Ciampino airport at about 08:00 following a 90min flight from 
Frankfurt Hahn airport, and it was about 36h before the severely damaged hull (EI-DYG) could be removed by low-
loader from its resting place almost on the threshold at the runway end.
There were a few minor injuries among the six crew members and 166 passengers on board the aircraft. A Ryanair 
statement, confirmed by the Italian accident investigation agency ANSV, says that the aircraft hit a flock of birds at 
about 200ft (60m) during its final approach.
Passengers report that just before landing the aircraft pulled up, there was a banging sound from the engine or 
engines, and then the aircraft descended rapidly toward the surface.
Photographs of the aircraft's underside clearly show that a tailstrike had taken place, rippling in the lower fuselage 
skin is visible, and that the left main gear structure breached the port wing's upper surface near the wing root. The 
right main gear looks more or less undamaged.

EasyJet shares get a boost amid boardroom battle

Analysts say Stelios strategy is risky
Body
EasyJet was one of the best performing FTSE 350 stocks yesterday in spite of its boardroom fight while Ryanair, its 
low-cost rival, fell in a weak overall market.
The strategies of the two low-cost carriers for dealing with the deepening recession are diverging sharply.
The Irish airline continues to add capacity with the aim of gaining market share, while the EasyJet board is at odds 
over how cautious it should be and whether it should halt expansion.
Shares in EasyJet rose 10½p to 276½p, making it the eighth-strongest performer, while Ryanair fell 5 cents to 
EUR2.80.
Some analysts warned of the risks posed by the attempt by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, EasyJet founder and a non-
executive director, to increase his influence by appointing two of his own nominees to the board, and warned of the 
impact the fight could have on the valuation of the group.
Sir Stelios is seeking to persuade the EasyJet board to adopt an ultra-cautious approach.
Andrew Fitchie, aviation analyst at Collins Stewart, said EasyJet was viewed as a growth stock. "Any change in 
strategy would markedly impact value," he said.
"We have long argued that low-cost carriers' profits are boosted by growth; cheap aircraft, maintenance holidays 
and the benefit of increasing scale all depress unit costs. Ex-growth, we would expect these trends to unwind."
By contrast Ryanair was showing no signs of scaling down. "It has decided to adopt the high-risk strategy of 
continued expansion, attempting to leverage off its lower cost base and to take share from weaker competitors. 
EasyJet is strategically boxed into a corner," Mr Fitchie said.
EasyJet shares get a boost amid boardroom battle
EasyJet is due to report its full-year results today with an expected fall in underlying profits from £191m to about 
£120m.
The dispute between Sir Stelios and the rest of the board could take some time to resolve, as the two sides take 
legal advice over the interpretation of the EasyJet articles of association.
Sir Stelios said at the weekend: "The articles are clear that I can be chairman and I can appoint an additional two 
non-executive directors . . . But what complicates matters is that I do not want to be chairman.
"What's not that clear . . . I have to admit, is if I can be a non-executive director but not chairman - but of course a 
chairman is de facto also a director - and still appoint two additional non-executive directors."
Lawyers on both sides were trying to clarify the issue.
Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at RBS, said: "It is clearly suboptimal that management is distracted at this 
challenging time in the market, a time also during which opportunities may arise as other airlines fail, which will call 
for prompt and bold decision-making."

Ryanair to donate all calendar proceeds to Dublin Simon
Ryanair to donate all calendar proceeds to Dublin Simon

Body
Ryanair has agreed to give all proceeds from the sale of its 2009 Cabin Crew Charity Calendar to Dublin Simon 
Community.
The charity, which provides services for homeless people in Dublin, was last week chosen as the sole recipient of 
all proceeds from the sale of the calendar.
The initiative is expected to raise funds of up to  100,000 for Dublin Simon Community, with an initial print run of 
10,000 calendar copies.
The publication will be available to purchase at a cost of  10 directly from Dublin Simon Community and Ryanair. 
Last year, the calendar raised  70,000 for Angels Quest Charity.
Commenting on the agreement, Dublin Simon Community chief executive SamMcGuinness said the organisation 
was increasingly reliant on funding from the corporate sector.
''With government funding constraints we now, more than ever, depend on the generosity of corporate supporters 
such as Ryanair to continue to provide services and shelter to those seeking our assistance," he said.
''We are frustrated that the chance was not taken during better economic times to eliminate homelessness and, as 
our economy changes, we are faced with the prospect of even more people facing into tougher and less secure 
times."
Dublin Simon Community is the oldest of seven Simon Community groups operating around the country. 
Established in 1969, it provides a range of services to homeless people living in Dublin, including soup and 
sandwich runs and emergency accommodation.
Earlier this month, Dublin Simon Community launched its House of Cards appeal, with the aim of raising up to  
800,000.
Ryanair to donate all calendar proceeds to Dublin Simon
The initiative encourages companies to make donations to the organisation instead of spending money on 
corporate Christmas cards.
Ryanair operates 688 low-fare routes across 26 European countries. Established in 1985, the company employs 
6,371 staff. In the six months to the end of August, it had revenues of  1.8 billion.

Highlight: Entrepreneur wants to take cautious route
Stake is increased to appoint more directors
Body
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, one of the most flamboyant entrepreneurs of the past decade, is seeking to wrest back 
influence over EasyJet amid a boardroom dispute at the low-cost airline. Sir Stelios has fallen out with the EasyJet 
board over the airline's strategic direction and is pushing the company, his most successful creation, to be much 
more cautious in the face of the growing crisis in the airline industry.
He is challenging the airline's strategy of ambitious growth supported by the acquisition of hundreds of cheap 
Airbus aircraft.
The company's shares fell by almost 5 per cent as investors worried about divisions at the top. To push his case, 
Sir Stelios has increased his stake in the airline in order to appoint two more directors to the board.
He has raised his holding from 15.6 to 26.9 per cent via the transfer of the legal interest in his sister's 11.3 per cent 
stake to EasyGroup Holdings, his Cayman Islands-registered company.
With more than 25 per cent, Sir Stelios has the right under EasyJet's articles of association to appoint the new 
directors, giving him control of a quarter of the board. He has also reminded EasyJet directors of his right to appoint 
himself chairman should they seek to block the move.
In a statement, EasyJet said that the board had already sought to adopt a "more cautious approach to fleet growth" 
given the downturn in the market and had taken steps to conserve cash, reduce growth plans and dispose of 
surplus aircraft.
It said Sir Stelios had indicated, however, that he wished the company "further to restrict future aircraft orders and 
to make future dividend payments in conjunction with a cessation or slowing of growth".
EasyJet, in common with Ryanair, its fast-growing Irish rival, has never paid dividends in the belief that the group 
was a growth stock that rewarded investors through capital appreciation from a rising share price.
Sir Stelios in EasyJet board battle
Sir Stelios's surprise intervention indicates he might believe the era of such growth is over.
In an e-mailed statement, he said yesterday: "I am merely applying my rights under the articles of association of the 
company to protect my investment in EasyJet.
"I did not request a dividend now. I think the company should plan to pay one in 2011 if the markets allow."
Sir Stelios's 15.6 per cent stake is valued at £175m.

Ryanair has lodged appeals against eight separate EU decisions to block Ryanair access to documents in the 
Commission's ongoing State Aid investigations against several small regional European airports.
Ryanair's Director of Legal and Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said: "The Commission's unlawful refusal to 
allow Ryanair to access documents in their investigation contravenes the principle of openness and transparency 
enshrined in the EU Treaty, and flies in the face of EU transparency legislation, which gives the public the right to 
access Commission documents. These unjustified refusals are damaging the travelling public, and deny Ryanair 
the ability to defend these ongoing State aid cases."
"The Commission fails to provide any justified reason for refusing access to these documents and is simply afraid to 
grant access to evidence of the Commission's biased and flawed application of the EU State aid rules."
"It is no coincidence that nine of the ten State aid investigations at European airports launched by the Commission 
since July 2007 concern Ryanair and easyJet. It is part of the Commission's policy aimed at undermining the 
competitors of ailing national airlines and there is no basis whatsoever for any of these bogus investigations which 
simply give Alitalia and other failing airlines some breathing space before the next 'rescue' plan can be rubber-
stamped.

Ryanair has lodged appeals against eight separate EU decisions to block Ryanair access to documents in the 
Commission's ongoing State Aid investigations against several small regional European airports.
Ryanair's Director of Legal and Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said: "The Commission's unlawful refusal to 
allow Ryanair to access documents in their investigation contravenes the principle of openness and transparency 
enshrined in the EU Treaty, and flies in the face of EU transparency legislation, which gives the public the right to 
access Commission documents. These unjustified refusals are damaging the travelling public, and deny Ryanair 
the ability to defend these ongoing State aid cases."
"The Commission fails to provide any justified reason for refusing access to these documents and is simply afraid to 
grant access to evidence of the Commission's biased and flawed application of the EU State aid rules."

Aer Lingus and unions invited to talks

Aer Lingus and trade unions representing its 4,300 staff have been invited to talks today by the Irish government as 
fears escalate of possible strikes at the former state-owned airline.
The intervention yesterday by the National Implementation Body, the arbitration agency chaired by the taoiseach's 
(prime minister's) senior civil servant, came as Irish travel agents warned holidaymakers not to use Aer Lingus over 
the Christmas period because of strike fears.
The warnings follow the decision on Monday by the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, the 
main trade union at the airline, to give the company two weeks' notice of possible strike action over plans to 
outsource 1,300 jobs among ground staff at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.
In a statement accompanying third quarter results, the company forecast operating losses this year of EUR20m 
(£16m) and losses in 2009.
"Operating at a financial loss is not sustainable. Aer Lingus must now deliver the required level of cost-saving 
measures to ensure the group is well-positioned to grow revenue and profitability into the future," it said.
The company is looking for savings of EUR50m by outsourcing jobs such as catering and baggage handling to 
third-party suppliers. It has written to every employee setting out the terms for voluntary redundancy or early 
retirement. The company said staff could transfer to the new suppliers on the same terms and conditions they 
enjoyed at Aer Lingus. It wants staff to respond to the plan by December 15.
In talks with unions, it said it would consider alternative proposals that would achieve the same savings. However, it 
warned yesterday that, if the trade unions do not come back with alternatives by December 1, it will proceed with its 
plans.
Meanwhile, Ryanair, which owns just below 30 per cent of the company and had a EUR2.70 a share takeover bid 
rebuffed in December 2006, declined to comment.
Aer Lingus and unions invited to talks
The Irish government, which retains a 25 per cent share of Aer Lingus, opposed Ryanair's bid. However, some 
brokers believe that, with government deficits mounting, Ryanair might decide it is opportune to bid again for the 
company.

Wildcat strike causes airport chaos in Italy

Body
Travelers faced long lines, delays and cancellations at Italian airports on Tuesday, a day after a wildcat strike by 
some Alitalia workers forced the carrier to scrap dozens of flights. Some disputes became so heated that police had 
to intervene.
Lines at Alitalia check-in counters at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport stretched for 200 feet (60 meters) as the 
terminal struggled with a backlog of hundreds of passengers who spent the night on the floor or in chairs after their 
flights were canceled due to Monday's strike.
Some angry travelers threatened ground personnel and police came in to calm them down.
Alitalia said a total of 124 flights were canceled among all its operations Tuesday as a result of the wildcat strike a 
day earlier, as well as because of a work-to-the-rules job action, which pilots have been waging. The airline 
predicted some 50 flights would have to be scratched on Wednesday.
Many of Tuesday's cancellations came in Rome's main airport and at Milan's Linate airport.
Adding to the transport mayhem, Italy's civil aviation authority said Ciampino, Rome's second-largest airport and a 
low-cost hub, would remain closed until Tuesday evening as workers removed a Ryanair plane that made a hard 
emergency landing Monday after hitting a flock of birds.
The plane damaged its left gear and ended its run leaning on the left wing. Two crew members and four 
passengers suffered minor injuries but all had been released from hospital, Ryanair said Tuesday.
Some 200 Alitalia flight attendants and pilots staged a surprise protest on Monday, blocking the crew entrance at 
Leonardo da Vinci and preventing staff wanting to fly from entering the terminal.
Dozens of Alitalia flights were canceled across the country in Monday's chaos, although the carrier has not yet 
given an official count.

The protesters, who oppose a plan to salvage the bankrupt carrier by cutting routes and jobs, were ordered back to 
work Monday night by Italy's transport minister.

FAA renews, toughens warning to Boeing 737 pilots
FAA renews, toughens warning to Boeing 737 pilots

Body
The Federal Aviation Administration has toughened a requirement that Boeing 737 pilots be reminded not to ignore 
a cabin pressure warning horn, ordering preflight briefings as well as changes in manuals.
The airworthiness directive, issued Monday and effective Nov. 25, stems from a crash in which 121 people died on 
Aug. 14, 2005, when a Helios Airways 737-300 slammed into a hillside north of Athens, Greece.
Greek investigators determined that the pilots had lost consciousness because of a cabin pressure failure shortly 
after takeoff on a flight from Nicosia, Cyprus, and that the plane kept going on autopilot for two hours until it ran out 
of fuel.
Authorities say the cabin pressure control settings had been operated improperly and that an alarm went unheeded. 
Last Tuesday the attorney general of Cyprus said five people would face criminal charges for the crash.
The FAA's order applies to all Boeing 737s, the world's best-selling commercial jet with more than 6,000 orders 
since the model was launched in 1965 and 5,397 in use worldwide, and takes effect in 120 days. Public notice and 
comment requirements were waived "because an unsafe condition exists that requires the immediate adoption" of 
the directive, according to the notice.
Changes in the manuals must be made by each airline. The process is complex, varying by aircraft as well as the 
nature of the change, and new wording must be validated before it can take effect, FAA spokesman Les Dorr said.
FAA directives typically are reissued by civil aviation authorities in other countries.
Airlines with large number of 737s, according to the Web site http://www.airfleets.net, include Southwest with 541 
planes, Continental with 259, Ryanair of Ireland with 168, United with 162, Alaska with 110, Air China with 107 and 
China Southern with 102. Southwest, Ryanair, Alaska and some smaller carriers have all-737 fleets.
Chicago-based Boeing Co. and FAA representatives said the cockpit warning horn serves a dual purpose. On the 
ground it indicates something is wrong with the plane's pre-takeoff configuration, such as the setting of the wing 
FAA renews, toughens warning to Boeing 737 pilots
flaps. In the air it means a loss of cabin pressure, which can cause pilots to lose consciousness if they don't 
immediately put on oxygen masks.
The FAA directed on July 7, 2006, that flight manuals be changed to remind pilots to pay heed to the warning horn 
after takeoff, but "we have received continuing reports of in-service events involving failure of the flight crew to 
recognize and react property to valid cabin altitude (air pressure) warning horns," according to the latest directive.
Dorr wrote in an e-mail that between the Helios crash and the first directive, the FAA received four reports of pilots 
disregarding the alarm, all from U.S. carriers which he did not identify. Since then there have been three reports 
from carriers that were not identified by country, he added.
Such problems in other countries typically are reported to civil aviation authorities who then notify the manufacturer, 
in this case Boeing, which in turn alerts the FAA, Dorr said.
Before the Helios crash, Boeing was alerted to "some cases where flight crews were getting confused" about the 
alarm horn and advised airlines "to do a little crew training on that," Boeing spokeswoman Liz Verdier said.
After the FAA's initial directive, which largely incorporated Boeing's advisory note, the manufacturer began working 
on a change in the cockpit and flight deck design to incorporate a warning light that will provide a second indication 
of cabin pressure loss when the horn sounds, Verdier said.
"Within the next month or so," she said, Boeing expects to have the change ready to incorporate into production of 
current models, the 737-700, -800 and 900, followed by production of retrofitting kits for earlier models a few 
months after that.
The FAA may propose further action to "address the unsafe condition" once the warning light kits are available, 
according to the airworthiness directive.

A Ryanair flight from Frankfurt made an emergency landing at a Rome airport Monday after birds hit the aircraft, 
aviation and airline officials company said.
Three passengers and two crew members were taken to hospital with minor injuries, Ryanair spokesman Stephen 
McNamara said.
The aircraft "suffered multiple bird strikes" as it was approaching Ciampino airport, McNamara said. Ryanair 
spokeswoman Pauline McAlester said the birds were sucked into the engine as the aircraft was coming in to land.
Italy's civil aviation agency ENAC said the Boeing 737 landed safely just before 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) Monday. It said 
the jet carried 166 passengers.
Airport fire official Marco Ghimenti told Sky TG-24 TV that passengers left the plane through a door and an 
emergency chute. He said that the landing gear appeared to give way when the plane came down at the far end of 
a runway.
McNamara said the jet's left-hand main landing gear suffered substantial damage that was delaying the removal of 
the jet from the runway.
The airport, on the Italian capital's southeast outskirts, was temporarily closed.

Ryanair results on the up as oil prices plummet
Ryanair results on the up as oil prices plummet

Michael O'Leary is hopeful that his company can benefit from any recession, writes David Clerkin, Markets 
Correspondent.
Recent sharp falls in oil prices will leave Ryanair on course to deliver a better-than-expected break-even 
performance for its full year, said chief executive Michael O'Leary said last week.
Speaking after posting pretax, pre-exceptional profits of  224 million for the six months to September (down from 
460 million last year),O'Leary said the results were ''a testimony to the strength of the Ryanair lowest fare model''.
Ryanair shareholders had been on notice to expect full-year losses of up to  60 million since the airline reported 
first-quarter figures in August.
Since then, however, for Ryanair (now the second-largest Iseq company), resilient passenger numbers and a 
retreat in oil prices have laid the ground for a more favourable set of full-year figures.
The movements in world oil prices will also be good news for O'Leary, following a series of uninspired attempts to 
predict future prices that saw him fail to hedge when prices were low and instead lock in a sizeable portion of 
Ryanair's requirements for early 2009 at unfavourable prices.
O'Leary hedged 80 per cent of Ryanair's fuel requirements for the third quarter (January to March 2009) at $124 per 
barrel - almost double the current spot rate. This cost disadvantage will unwind from quarter four, however, as 
O'Leary had decided against hedging for the period and will instead be able to take advantage of substantially lower 
fuel bills.
The airline has also opted to hedge up to 25 per cent of its fuel requirements for the period between April and 
September 2009 at the relatively low forward prices on offer, a factor that will provide it with greater insurance 
against a repeat of this year's oil price spike.
Ryanair results on the up as oil prices plummet
O'Leary warned, however, that oil prices were only one part of the Ryanair equation. The spectre of recessions in 
the airline's main markets threatened to continue to drive down average fares, which fell 4 per cent during the half-
year.
But he said recessions would also throw up long-term opportunities for Ryanair as less efficient carriers would fail to 
make it through the next stage of the economic cycle.
''Hopefully, a very deep, dark recession will continue to lower oil prices and significantly lower aircraft prices and we 
will put in place a very significant cost saving to return to substantial profitability in the coming years," he told 
analysts last week.
O'Leary once again predicted a fresh wave of airline bankruptcies to follow earlier casualties such as XL Airways 
and Futura.
''We believe more loss-making European airlines will go bust this winter, either because of unsustainable losses or 
insufficient cash reserves."
He said Ryanair was ready to add capacity at British and European airports if individual airlines folded and ceased 
to operate existing routes. Ryanair could move in and operate replacement services within as little as 30 days if it 
received a call from an airport to fill a vacancy created by an airline failure.
But he talked tough in respect of Ireland's airports, and pledged to strip out capacity in response to the 
government's decision to introduce a  10 departure tax on most flights out of the country.
He warned that Ryanair would effectively abandon Shannon, cutting services by up to 75 per cent from next year if 
the tax went ahead.
He also added to his lengthening series of attacks on the Dublin Airport Authority over its planned new terminal, 
which O'Leary has repeatedly criticised for being too expensive.
''I think the best thing that could happen in Dublin Airport is a significant decline in traffic," he said. ''They will be

Ryanair has received approaches from three major German airports to establish its appetite for setting up new 
routes at short notice.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said last week that the airports had made contact ''in recent weeks'' 
and that Ryanair would seek to take advantage of opportunities created by further airline collapses in Europe.
''We've been approached by three large German airports in recent weeks," O'Leary told analysts following the 
publication of Ryanair's half-year results.
He said each of the three was ''very keen to try to get Ryanair to commit to opening up a base'' in the event of the 
collapse of one of the major airlines operating from them.
''There is some speculation that there may be some further airline casualties in Germany this winter," he said. 
''Obviously if that were to happen, I think we would see some significant opportunities in Germany."
O'Leary said it would typically take Ryanair up to 60 days to begin services from a new airport, but that it could 
establish a new base within 30 days if the collapse of an existing airline created a ''vacuum''.
''Airports seem to be very attracted to us at the moment because most of them realise that we could show up with 
six, eight, ten aircraft, almost the day after somebody else goes bankrupt," O'Leary said. ''We wouldn't start flying 
those aircraft immediately, but we could be there on the ground and start selling those flights and those routes and 
taking up those routes almost straightaway."
He said many of the airports which had approached Ryanair would not negotiate with the airline as recently as 12 
months ago. Ryanair was now seen as a potential ''turnkey solution'' to get airports back up and running in the 
event of an airline collapse, he said.

Ryanair could face fines of up to  100,000 if it fails to provide an email address on its website, following a ruling by 
the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
The EU's E-commerce Directive requires company websites to feature an e-mail address and an alternative method 
for consumers to communicate with the company in a ''direct and effective'' way. In a case brought by a German 
consumer association against insurance company Deutsche Internet Versicherung, the court ruled that a company 
had to offer customers ''a rapid, direct and effective means of communication, in addition to its electronic mail 
address''.
Ryanair offers customers a telephone number for inquiries, but it is only staffed from 9am to 5.45pm, Monday to 
Friday. New EU rules that came into effect on November 1 also require airlines to show the full cost of fares upfront, 
including fees, charges and taxes. Airlines can no longer impose charges without passengers' active consent.
National Consumer Agency (NCA) spokesman John Shine said the agency had been ''engaging with a number of 
airlines on a variety of issues'', including upfront pricing, opting for insurance and refundability of fees and charges.
''Our engagement with Ryanair is in the context of a package of issues. The EC regulations deal with a number of 
those matters. We have also been in touch with the Department of Transport about this and expect to have further 
dealings with the airlines. We have also taken up the e-mail issue and we shall be following up on it."
The NCA has a range of enforcement tools, ranging from seeking undertakings to issuing compliance notices, 
seeking prohibition orders or bringing a criminal prosecution. The 2007 Consumer Protection Act provides for fines 
of up to  100,000 plus up to 18 months' imprisonment for breach of consumers' rights.
A Ryanair spokesman said the airline would be analysing the implications of the ECJ ruling. He pointed out that the 
Irish call centre number on the Ryanair website was charged at the national rate. "Out of office hours, we have 
ticket desks in all airports open in accordance with scheduled Ryanair flights, and a 24/7 fax line is open for any 
refund requests," he said.

Looking for a bargain ski holiday home? There are a surprising number of resorts to choose from.
The Irish have fallen head over heels for skiing since the advent of our newfound wealth. Unfortunately much of that 
newfound wealth has now dissipated, but it is unlikely in the longer term that the Irish will wish to stay off the pistes 
for too long if they can avoid it.
In reality, if you have  200,000 or less to spend on a ski property you're not likely to make it to the top tier ski resorts 
- instead, you'll have to be a bit more creative. You may well find that you are a candidate for a property in some of 
the lesser known ski resorts in France or Austria, or some of those in up and coming central and eastern European 
(CEE) countries.
Cost of access will be a significant factor in any decision. The pistes may not be as long or as well groomed and the 
après ski won't be of the same quality, but if it's skiing you're after you can find plenty of it around Europe without 
breaking the bank.
Now is as good a time as any - buyers are very scarce on the ground and the opportunity is there to bargain hard 
with developers or individual sellers. You will need more cash than before though, as the amount you can borrow 
and rates on offer are not as good as they used to be.
If you're looking for individual owners who are anxious to sell and who may be willing to take an offer, then your 
best bet is websites that offer private sellers the chance to list properties such as www.MyOverseasProperty.ie,       
     www.PrivateSeller.ie or            www.OverseasCafe.com.
Pyrenees, France The Pyrenees Orientales, on the French Spanish border, is one of the most accessible and 
affordable ski options for the Irish. Ryanair can take you within a 90 minute drive of the slopes, with access from 
Cork, Shannon and Dublin into either Gerona in Spain or Carcassonne in France.

There are ten ski-resorts in the Roussillon region, all of which are around a ten minute drive from each other. The 
most developed of the resorts are Les Angles and Font Romeu. Les Angles has over 60 kilometres of slopes, and 
both towns have a selection of restaurants and shops as well as plenty of amenities such as ice rinks, swimming 
pools, cinemas, animal parks and lakes.
Formigueres is also worth a visit, as it is a very authentic, quaint French village. The area around the slopes is full 
of beautiful mature forests and the views are breathtaking. The area is not heavily advertised so you tend to get a 
local crowd, according to Suzanne O'Reilly of BidsInFrance.com.
In the Roussillon a full day's ski-pass with insurance costs about  30, while boots and skis can be hired for  10 a 
day.
In les Angles, BidsInFrance.com has a well maintained studio apartment in the heart of the resort, with lake and 
mountain views from the balcony. The property is on the market for  50,000.
There is also a three-bed, two-bath chalet with a living room with a stone fireplace and French windows opening 
onto a terrace with great views. This property is on the market for  199,000.
In Formiqueres, there is a duplex-style apartment which will cater for four people. The property is in need of some 
redecoration and is going for  115,000 with private parking included.
Alps, France Les Deux Alpes sits at the top of the Veneon Valley, in the heart of the Oisans. The region boasts 
world class ski runs and the largest ski-able glacier in Europe. Slopes vary from 1,300 to 3,600 metres, which make 
it a snow-sure resort.
The region has 76 runs over 200 kilometres, with 63 ski lifts, and occupies both sides of the valley. There are, 
unusually, two seasons because of the glacier, which contains eight runs. Passes are cheapest in early winter.
Access is either with Ryanair into Grenoble or via Lyon, which is 160 kilometres from the resort, with a transfer via 
Grenoble, which is 70 kilometres from the resort.
OverseasProperties.com currently has a hotel with a wooden chalet-style extension. The apartments have spacious 
balconies and terraces designed to provide an indoor/ outdoor transition. There will be a contemporary feel with 
wide-paned windows. Studios start from  90,000, with one-beds from  175,000 and two-beds from  145,000.
Slovakia Slovakia has some of the highest mountain resorts in central Europe, rising to an altitude of 2,655metres, 
and eastern Slovakia's High and Low Tatra mountains can accommodate skiing for four or five months of the year. 
Skiing in Slovakia generally costs about half the price it does in the Alpine resorts.
The Lodge is a project being promoted by The Right Move Abroad. It is located in the village of Stratena, within the 
Slovak Paradise national park. This Unesco heritage site offers a range of attractions for its visitors including skiing, 
climbing, hiking, golf, horse riding, caving, fishing and camping.
This project is a refurbishment of a traditional ski lodge into high standard holiday apartments. There will be 14 
apartments, a bar, breakfast room, sauna and aromatherapy room. It is surrounded by old trees and a stream, and 
there is a covered barbecue area.
Parking spaces are located in the gated back yard and the local ski-lift is 300 metres away. There are restaurants 
and pubs centred around the Dobsinska Ice Cave, the focal point of the area, 200 metres away.
The village has numerous guest houses, small restaurants and pubs, and the popular ski resort of Telgart is located 
four kilometres away. Prices start from  39,000.
David Stanley Redfern is currently promoting the Mlynky Wellness Spa, also in the Slovak Paradise national park. 
The development features an on-site spa and wellness facilities to provide a year round attraction to the hotel.
Property off the beaten piste
The project is on the doorstep of 600 metres of nursery slopes, and within five minutes of the Telgart ski lifts, which 
have nine downhill runs and 27 kilometres of cross-country skiing.
There are studio, one and two-bed apartments as well as two-bed mezzanine penthouses. All have views from the 
terrace, over the ski slope or across the countryside to the mountains. The price includes an option to spend 20 
days free of charge each year.
This is an existing hotel with high year-round occupancy levels. Completion is in 2010 and mortgages of up to 80 
per cent are available. The price for a 41 square metre studio is  73,792, a 56 square metre one-bed will set you 
back  101,031, while a 90.75 square metre two-bed costs  161,989.
Access to both developments is via Poprad Tatry airport, located 30 kilometres away, which is accessed via either 
Bratislava or Prague.
Bulgaria Pamporovo is a modern ski resort in the heart of the Rhodopi mountain range in Bulgaria. The town 
contains a mixture of period and new build properties, but has not yet become over-developed. It is considered to 
have snow conditions similar to the Alps, as it is at an altitude of 1,650metres.
It is sheltered by the Pirin mountains, so there are virtually no stoppages during the snow season. There are a 
number of ski lifts directly into town so there are options for ski-in/ski out properties.
Pamporovo is the most southerly skiing resort in Europe and is the sunniest Bulgarian mountain resort. It is 240 
kilometres from Sofia and 85 kilometres from Plovdiv. Access is generally via Sofia, but you can get flight only deals 
with Balkan Tours from Dublin and Belfast into Plovdiv for  350 return.
There is a major  55 million project underway called the Sports and Tourist Centre Perelik, which is extending the 
resort of Pamporovo by connecting it to the surrounding mountains. The project will include 24 new ski routes 
extending to 55 kilometres, as well as summer and winter facilities, and it is due for completion by 2014.
This extension will make Pamporovo part of one of the largest ski fields in Europe. Appreciating Assets is offering 
units in the Pamporovo Palace complex in the centre of Pamporovo. The complex, which opened for the winter 
season of 2006/2007, is located ten metres from the main lift station, with one entrance facing on to one of the ski 
runs. It is also 300 metres from the main town centre.
The complex includes 87 apartments (studios, one and two-bed units) with built areas of between 36 and 120 
square metres. Facilities include a lobby bar, restaurant and bank. Studio prices start from  59,000 with one-beds 
from  103,000 and two-beds from  130,000.

Britain's banking system continued to feel the aftershocks of earlier collapses, posing further risks to the wider 
economy.
Retail sales and the construction industry were particularly hard hit as the lack of available credit took its toll on both 
private and public spending.
Thursday's dramatic 1.5 per cent interest rate cut offered some relief, especially for struggling smaller businesses, 
as more UK lenders agreed to lower their own borrowing rates.
Smaller company insolvencies had been estimated to rise by a "catastrophic" rate of 41 per cent by the end of next 
year compared with last year, according to a survey by insolvency practitioners.
Banks 
Lloyds TSB promised to find £1.5bn of savings from its merger with HBOS - 50 per cent more than previously 
announced - by making cuts in retail banking operations, threatening thousands of jobs. The revised estimate came 
as HBOS, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, announced writedowns of £5.18bn against its profit and loss account 
for the nine months to the end of September, more than double the losses taken in the first half. The new chief 
executive of Royal Bank of Scotland denounced his predecessors for having fostered the "bull market culture" that 
led to the £20bn state-backed bail-out of the troubled bank.
Stephen Hester, who formally takes up his position later this month, said RBS had overstretched itself at the wrong 
time, which made the bank vulnerable in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers' collapse. RBS also announced it would 
make further writedowns of £206m in the third quarter but avoided £1.2bn of losses by reclassifying toxic assets 
under new accounting rules. Bradford & Bingley , the nationalised mortgage lender, reported a sharp rise in the 
number of customers falling behind on their mortgage payments, raising fears that the taxpayer could be exposed 
to further losses. Arrears on B&B's buy-to-let loans jumped to 2.3 per cent of the loan book in the third quarter from 
0.8 per cent in the same period last year.
The Week
Travel & Leisure 
Ryanair warned it would make a loss in the second half of the year after profits in its first six months plunged 77 per 
cent, mainly as a result of higher fuel costs. Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the low-cost airline, said the 
company would seek to gain market share as the recession looms by taking advantage of the falling oil price to 
reduce fares by up to 20 per cent.
General Financial 
The UK's biggest listed private equity group, 3i , reported its first negative returns for five years due to a rapid 
deterioration in the value of its investments and the impairments it was forced to make on potential losses. The 
group, which owns a diverse range of companies from the lingerie brand Agent Provocateur to oil and gas 
companies, is considered relatively defensive, but the sector has been hard hit by the credit crunch as it relies 
heavily on the availability of debt. The London Stock Exchange adopted a more aggressive strategy in its fight 
against rival new equities platforms, imposing from Monday a special charge of 1 basis point on any trade that is 
routed to the exchange via one of its competitors. The newly established Nasdaq OMX Europe had criticised the 
LSE's move when it was announced a month ago for being "anti-competitive" and accused the exchange of 
"artificially controlling competition in order to maintain high prices".
Household Goods 
Royal Worcester & Spode , the porcelain-maker founded in the 18th century, was one of Britain's oldest 
businesses to fall victim to the financial crisis. The private company was forced into administration after the 
economic downturn hit its already dwindling sales. It had been in an almost constant state of restructuring over 
recent years, struggling to sell its high-end crockery as casual styles of dining became more popular. Forty jobs 
were lost yesterday, the BBC reported.
Media 
Reed Elsevier,  the Anglo-Dutch publisher, surprised analysts by naming a former head of a UK housebuilder with 
no media experience as its new chief executive. Ian Smith, who earned a reputation for dealmaking after 
overseeing a £5bn merger with George Wimpey while head of Taylor Woodrow, will take over from Sir Crispin 
Davis next year. The appointment renewed speculation that Reed might again consider merging with Wolters 
Kluwer, its Dutch rival.

EasyJet PLC, Europe's second largest discount airline, said Thursday it carried 18 percent more passengers this 
October than it did in the same month last year, helped by acquisitions of rivals in the face of an economic 
downturn.
The airline's passenger numbers have risen consistently since it took over rival British carrier GB Airways Ltd. 
earlier this year. The 104 million pound takeover allowed EasyJet to increase flight offerings from its key London 
Gatwick base.
EasyJet said it flew 3.96 million people in October, compared with 3.34 million in October of 2007. Over the same 
period, the load factor or proportion of seats filled rose 1.4 percentage points to 84 percent.
Shares rose 3.6 percent to 316.5 pence ($5).

Second runway 'not needed until 2017'
Body
The timing of the £2.3bn project to build a second runway and terminal at Stansted airport has been thrown into 
turmoil by the competition watchdog, which questioned yesterday the urgency of expansion against a background 
of "deteriorating economic and financial conditions".
The Competition Commission said its forecasts indicated that a second runway would be not be needed until 2017 
at the earliest - two years later than proposed by Stansted's owner, BAA. Traffic volumes at the UK's third largest 
airport have been falling for 11 months.
The commission's report could undermine the basis for the planning inquiry, due to open next spring, into BAA's 
application to expand Stansted.
The airports group, a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial, wants to develop capacity to handle 68m passengers a year - 
the size of Heathrow airport today - by 2030. BAA's planning application is based on bringing the first phase of the 
scheme into operation in 2015. Stansted's current capacity is 25m passengers a year.
The commission also rebuffed BAA's call for a big increase in the maximum charges the group can levy on airlines 
at Stansted over the next five years. However, it rejected Ryanair's claim that BAA had set excessive prices this 
year. It also recommended reducing drastically the level of capital expenditure planned by BAA on existing facilities 
at the airport by 2013 from £239m to £85m.
It found the group had acted against the public interest in failing to consult airlines adequately on its plans to build 
the second runway and terminal. It had also failed the public in the quality of service provided at Stansted, in 
particular in the processing of passengers through security.
Watchdog queries Stansted expansion
BAA said it was "disappointed" the commission had failed to reflect large elements of the costs involved in 
operating Stansted. Regulators should "fully consider the cost of taking such ambitious proposals from the drawing 
board to reality", it said. "We continue to believe SG2 [the second runway] is a sound project."
The report also revealed the deep divisions between the commission and the Civil Aviation Authority over the 
approach to price regulation at Stansted. The watchdog recommended that the CAA, the airports economic 
regulator, should continue with a traditional price control regime at Stansted. The CAA called last year for price 
controls at Stansted to be removed altogether, on the grounds that the airport was not a monopoly business, but it 
was rebuffed by Ruth Kelly, then transport secretary.
EasyJet welcomed the commission's recommendations on future charges and said yesterday: "In the current 
economic climate, more than ever, the flying public needs to be protected from monopoly abuse."
BAA had "kept airlines in the dark on too many major decisions but has expected us to pick up the bill for its 
excesses", it said.
The Competition Commission is separately investigating the structure of BAA and has already provisionally 
recommended the break-up of the group's airport monopolies in London and Scotland.

News In Brief
## Finance minister Brian Lenihan has warned more spending cuts could be on the way - despite the outrage 
provoked by the emergency budget. As the European Commission announced proceedings against the government 
over its huge borrowing levels, Mr Lenihan insisted day-to-day spending would have to be reduced further to keep 
the national debt at acceptable levels. Mr Lenihan insisted he would not be forced into a mini-budget next year, but 
that further cuts were a possibility. "The budget will be addressed in the Finance Act in a few weeks' time and 
obviously if further expenditure control measures are required they will be adopted." - Irish Examiner
## A man is being sued by four subscription cable companies for allegedly costing them up to 9.2m euro by selling 
equipment enabling free access to their tv services. Thomas Roddy, with addresses at Galway and Co 
Roscommon, is facing actions by UPC Communications Ireland and three Swiss registered companies which 
provide services controlling access to digital tv. Mr Roddy claims to be a student teacher suffering from depressive 
episodes. However, it was discovered that 200,000 euro was being "squirrelled away" from at least 15 bank 
accounts in his name, Mr Justice Peter Kelly was told yesterday by counsel for the companies. The judge granted 
applications by the companies to transfer their case to the Commercial Court. Counsel for Mr Roddy said he was 
denying all the claims "as it stands", and he asked for time to take instructions from his client. - Irish Independent
## Dublin city councillors have endorsed council management's opposition to Dublin Port Company's plan to infill 21 
hectares of Dublin Bay to expand its operations. A critical report by assistant city manager Michael Stubbs was 
backed by councillors at their monthly meeting in Dublin City Hall last night. It will now be submitted to An Bord 
Pleanala. Lord Mayor of Dublin Eibhlin Byrne told the meeting the proposed development would make the 
sustainability of the bay unmanageable. "It flies against our climate strategy," she said. - Irish Times ## Ryanair 
plans to exercise options to buy an additional 36 aircraft from Boeing in a move that will boost its planned fleet to

roughly 302 planes. Deputy chief executive Michael Cawley said the low-cost carrier was "very likely" to confirm the 
orders. Ryanair currently has a fleet of 160 aircraft and has already placed firm orders to increase that number to 
279 by 2013. The latest planned orders will place its fleet size on par with BA. - Irish Independent ## The size of the 
average mortgage approved in Ireland has increased by almost 7,000 euro in the past year, despite the fall in 
house prices. New figures released today by IFG's One Network - an independent broker network operating 
throughout the country - show that the average mortgage approved in Ireland has risen from 252,892 euro to 
259,215 euro, a 2.5pc increase. The number of people active in the market has fallen along with house prices but 
the size of the loans being approved continues to rise. This indicates that those that are buying are taking 
possession of bigger homes. - RTE ## Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) earned fee income of 
355m euro from its Irish and Northern Irish business, its latest financial year results show. Fee income grew by 
10.2pc on an all-Ireland basis in the year ended June 30. The company said yesterday this leaves it over 47m euro 
ahead of its nearest competitor. "Based on pipeline work, we anticipate growth to be in the high single digits in the 
next financial year," senior partner at PWC Ireland, Ronan Murphy, said. - Irish Independent ## Consumer goods 
giant Unilever has booked a once-off profit of 50.23m euro on the closure of a manufacturing plant in Inchicore, 
Dublin, which resulted in the loss of about 125 jobs last year. The profit on the sale of the plant to businessman 
David Kennedy contributed to a rise in pretax profit to 71.06m euro, from 26.62m euro. The Irish business did not 
pay a dividend to its parent last year. - Irish Times

Alitalia's restructuring plan has been challenged by Ryanair
AIR TRANSPORT
Another dawn
The latest rescue plan for Italy's flag carrier is the most far-reaching yet and has wide-ranging implications
GRAHAM DUNN LONDON
November is targeted to see a new dawn for Italy's airline sector and its long-struggling national carrier Alitalia. 
There have been many new dawns before. Yet Alitalia has still found itself again drinking in the last-chance saloon.
This time rescue efforts contain more drastic action, which in turn is likely to have a knock-on effect across the 
Italian airline sector. It not only removes the Italian state from Alitalia ownership, but will essentially merge it with 
Italy's second largest operator Air One and shrink their combined operation.
The latest rescue was hatched by Silvio Berlusconi's government after taking power earlier this year. It came after 
his high-profile criticism of an earlier deal under which Air France-KLM was to buy the carrier, which ultimately 
broke down.
Kept afloat by a ?300 million ($376 million) bridging loan - a commercial deal according to Italy, but subject of a 
European Commission state aid probe - Alitalia ultimately entered Italy's amended rules on extraordinary 
administration for large companies while efforts to put together a group of Italian investors to buy the carrier 
continued.
The Compagnia Aerea Italiana (CAI) grouping, led by Piaggio Group chairman Roberto Colaninno, has since 
submitted an offer for large parts of Alitalia with a view to launching a new, debt-free airline in November.
INTRODUCTION:
The first hurdle appears to have been overcome after unions backed the project. Unions eventually offered support 
for the framework agreement, despite concerns over cutbacks.
CAI's Phoenix Plan marks a reduction on a combination of today's Alitalia and Air One operations - the new carrier 
would operate around 150 aircraft compared with 200 and is expected to cut about 3,250 jobs - but is roughly 
comparable in size to Alitalia today.
AIR ONE KEY
Air One is key to the plan. The inclusion of Italy's second largest carrier, whose parent AP Holdings vied for Alitalia 
in the earlier failed privatisation efforts, provides a fast-track to modernising Alitalia's ageing fleet.
"Air One has a relatively modern fleet and you can very quickly modernise the Alitalia fleet," says CAI. "Two-thirds 
of the new Alitalia fleet will be modern," he says, adding that a further 40% of the fleet would be renewed by 2013 
using outstanding Air One orders.
Fast-growing Air One has already embarked on the overhaul of its medium-haul fleet with the arrival of Airbus A320 
narrowbodies - part of a commitment for up to 90 of the type - and this year moved into the long-haul market. It 
started flights to the USA this year by leasing two Airbus A330s and placed firm orders for 12 A330-200s and 12 
A350s.
Alitalia, according to Flight's ACAS database, itself operates 46 Airbus narrowbodies - with build dates ranging from 
1994 to 2004 - alongside 10 five- to six-year-old Boeing 777s and 10 Boeing 767s.
But around half its fleet comprises 73 Boeing MD-82s - the newest of which are more than 10 years old and the 
oldest of which date back 25 years. It is likely that aircraft left behind by CAI will be from this fleet. 
One of the other key issues for the consortium has been tackling the politically sensitive subject of whether to base 
the operation at Rome Fiumicino or Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports. Air France-KLM, in its takeover effort, 
opted for Rome and began scaling back its presence at Malpensa airport."CAI's answer is there will be no hub there 
will be six principal airports across Italy," it says.
While Piaggio's Colaninno will chair the new company, Rocco Sabelli will be the operational head - a man 
Colaninno successfully worked with at Telecom Italia and Piaggio and a man credited with a strong track record for 
turning round businesses.
NATIONAL INTEREST
"The entrepreneurs have made their money by running businesses well. They are doing this as a service to the 
country, but they are also doing it for commercial reasons," says CAI. "The geography of Italy and the transport 
infrastructure on the ground means air links for passengers and freight are important to Italy and an issue of 
national interest. That is the reason it is so attractive to investors, it is a strong domestic market, the fourth largest in 
Europe. That is a proper business even before the international routes."
CAI was formally established on 28 October and hopes to launch the carrier towards the end of November. It will 
also pick a strategic partner - and minority equity partner - for the relaunched carrier. Air France and Lufthansa are 
chiefly being courted - both already hold partnerships with Alitalia and Air One respectively. Sources suggest a 
decision is not expected until nearer the year end.
Hurdles remain, ranging from ensuring the relaunch has the backing of the European Commission, maintaining 
union support, to the challenging market conditions facing all carriers. But amid the uncertainty, one thing is certain. 
Whatever happens to Alitalia will filter through the rest of the Italian airline sector. A number of Italian carriers have 
put themselves in the frame to pick up assets from the group.
This includes confirmed interest from Blue Panorama, Eurofly, ItAli Airlines and MyAir for parts of Alitalia or 
subsidiary carriers Volare and Alitalia Express operations, while Italian freight carrier start-up ALIS and Miniliner 
INTRODUCTION:
owner Miro Ridici Finance have submitted interest in Alitalia's cargo operations. But this hinges on what is available 
after CAI picks the assets, In the meantime, carriers are continuing to develop their own activities. Meridiana - 
which will emerge as the second carrier in Italy if Alitalia and Air One are combined - has already unveiled its own 
restructuring plans aimed at countering the tougher conditions. It has highlighted more flexible labour deals and 
fleet overhaul - it plans to replace 14 of its 18 MD-80s with newer Airbus narrowbodies - as key to returning to 
profitability.
While budget carrier MyAir registered its interest in Alitalia's own budget operation Volare, the airline's focus is on 
developing a partnership with central European budget carrier SkyEurope. It has unveiled plans for a wide-ranging 
co-operation with the operator aimed at securing greater economies of scale.
AIR DOLOMITI PLANS
Lufthansa's Italian regional carrier Air Dolomiti meanwhile is strengthening its presence at Milan Malpensa - in light 
of Alitalia's scaling back at the airport - with plans to station six Airbus A319s at the northern Italian airport from 
February. Air Dolomiti will use the aircraft to fly non-German European routes.
While the outcome of saving Alitalia dominates the Italian landscape, the sector also faces the same market 
pressures and tough conditions confronting airlines. Italy has seen its share of collapsed carriers this year. Alpi 
Eagles stopped flights at the start of the year and has entered administration, Air Bee and Club Air have suspended 
flights - the former after only starting flights this year - while Brescia-based Ocean Airline is among this year's cargo 
carrier casualties.
Competition is intense, with no let-up from foreign carriers, notably budget operations EasyJet and Ryanair. Irish 
carrier Ryanair says Italy is now its second largest market after the UK and plans to set up two more bases at the 
Sardinian airports of Alghero and Cagliari and to add 11 routes from Bologna from spring.
UK operator EasyJet has also been steadily increasing its presence in the Italian sector, particularly out of its Milan 
Malpensa base.
"I don't think anyone is particularly excited about the crumbs from the Alitalia table," says EasyJet. "Clearly there 
will be opportunities where Alitalia has to pull off routes, but there have already been opportunities." 
Both carriers are closely watching the relaunch of Alitalia. Ryanair has already lodged a complaint with the 
European Commission over Italy's restructuring plan for Alitalia, while EasyJet is monitoring the situation.
"We are particularly concerned about the Rome-Milan Linate route," says EasyJet, of the route now dominated by 
Alitalia and Air One. "We have no problem with the creation of an Italian national carrier. We just want to make sure 
the consumers are not hit."
"Italy's geography and the
transport infrastructure on
the ground means air links are
an issue of national interest"

Highlight: Fare-price cuts set to spark losses
Fuel rises knock 77% off profits
Body
Ryanair profits fell heavily in its first six months under pressure from the doubling of its fuel costs and the group 
forecast it would be in loss during the second half of the year.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the recession would continue to drive down oil prices and fares this winter 
and said the group would "continue to respond with lower fares and aggressive price promotions" in order to fill 
seats in its expanding fleet.
He forecast average fares in the second half from October to March would fall by between 15 and 20 per cent, 
leading to losses in the third and fourth quarters.
The Irish carrier left its previous profit guidance unchanged and Mr O'Leary said he was confident Ryanair would 
break even in the full year to the end of March, a steep fall from record profits a year ago.
The group is discounting fares to fill its rising capacity in a weakening market, as it seeks to gain market share. Mr 
O'Leary forecast average fares in the full year could fall by 12 per cent.
Ryanair had been hit in the first half by its failure to hedge its fuel requirements, but expects to benefit next year 
thanks to the decline in the crude oil price from the peak of $147 a barrel in July.
Mr O'Leary said if oil prices remained about $80 a barrel the group's earnings would "rebound strongly".
Ryanair said it had taken advantage of the recent falls in the oil price to hedge 25 per cent of its fuel needs for the 
six months from April to September next year at an average of $77 a barrel, which would "lock in a substantial 
saving" over the $125 a barrel paid in the same period this year.
Ryanair said hedging markets had become illiquid as a result of the crisis in financial markets, however, and it had 
become difficult to find counterparties for its hedging contracts.
Ryanair expects fall into red in second half
In the first half of this year Ryanair said pre-tax profits fell 77 per cent from EUR459.5m to EUR105.2m (£84m) 
including exceptional costs of accelerated depreciation of EUR25.7m on 15 aircraft to be disposed of in 2008-09 
and 2009-10, and a EUR93.6m writedown on the group's 29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, the smaller rival Irish 
carrier.
Excluding exceptional items, profits fell 51 per cent to EUR224.5m. Turnover rose 16.5 per cent to EUR1.81bn, 
while passenger numbers improved 19 per cent to 31.6m. Earnings per sharefell from 26.61 cents to 6.42 cents.
Ryanair shares closed up 14 cents in Dublin at EUR2.83.

Highlight: First-half profits hit as fuel costs double
Airline to pursue strong promotions
Body
Ryanair profits fell heavily in its first six months under pressure from the doubling of fuel costs, and the group 
forecast that it would be in loss during the second half of the year.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the recession would continue to drive down oil prices and fares this winter.
Ryanair would "continue to respond with lower fares and aggressive price promotions," he said, in order to fill seats 
in its growing fleet.
The group, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, had only "limited visibility" of forward bookings, but Mr O'Leary 
forecast average fares in the second half from October to March would fall by between 15 and 20 per cent leading 
to losses in the third and fourth quarters.
The Irish carrier left its previous guidance unchanged, and Mr O'Leary said he was confident Ryanair would break 
even in the full year to the end of March. The group has been implementing a long series of discounted sale 
promotions to fill its rising capacity in a weakening market, as it gains market share, and Mr O'Leary forecast 
average fares in the full year could fall by almost 12 per cent.
The further decline in fares would be largely offset, however, by lower fuel costs, which were currently forecast at 
$73 a barrel for the fourth quarter.
Ryanair was hit in the first half of its financial year by its failure to hedge its fuel requirements, but it expects to 
benefit from this policy next year thanks to the steep decline in the crude oil price from the peak of $147 a barrel 
reached last July.
Mr O'Leary said that if oil prices remained at approximately $80 a barrel the group's earnings would "rebound 
strongly" next year.
Ryanair sees second-half loss amid fare price pressure
"We have a significant cost advantage over our competitors many of whom have hedged fuel next year at 
significantly higher levels than current market prices. This will force competitors to further increase air fares and 
widen the price gap between them and Ryanair's lowest fares," he said.
With one of the strongest balance sheets in the airline industry and the lowest cost base, Ryanair was "strongly 
positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that will inevitably arise from the financial crisis and economic 
recession over the coming year," he said.
In the first half this year Ryanair said pre-tax profits had fallen by 77 per cent from EUR459.5m ($582.6m) to 
EUR105.2m including exceptional costs of accelerated depreciation of EUR25.7m on 15 aircraft to be disposed of 
in financial years 2008/09 and 2009/10, and a EUR93.6m writedown on the group's 29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, 
the smaller rival Irish carrier.
Excluding exceptional items pre-tax profits fell by 51 per cent from EUR459.5m to EUR224.5m. Unit costs excluding 
fuel fell by 6 per cent in the half year but rose by 21 per cent including fuel.
Passenger numbers increased by 19 per cent from 26.6m to 31.6m.

Ryanair's chief aims to repeat the same trick as in the downturn following 9/11, writes Kevin Done
Body
Michael O'Leary is in ebullient mood. The Ryanair chief executive can hardly speak fast enough in his eagerness to 
reel off all the airline collapses and take-over deals of recent months, as the wave of airline consolidation 
accelerates.
He believes big opportunities are beckoning for Europe's largest low-cost carrier.
During the last airline recession in the early years of the decade in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, 
Ryanair made a grab for market share in Europe, driving down fares in order to drive up passenger numbers. It is 
setting out to repeat the same trick.
Earlier this decade, as others retrenched, Ryanair chose to grow faster. It accepted a temporary blow to its 
profitability in return for expanding the fleet and opened many new routes and bases.
In January 2002, as the lines of grounded jets parked in the US deserts stretched to the horizon, it placed a huge 
order for 100 Boeing 737-800 jets with options for another 50. It squeezed out of the US aircraft maker - at the time 
desperate for new orders - discounts that Mr O'Leary gleefully described as "rapacious".
Ryanair has been benefiting ever since from the low price it paid. It added further orders during the lean years 
before the industry began its sharp recovery from 2005 onwards and buyers from Asia-Pacific and the Middle East 
went on a wild buying spree at Airbus and Boeing.
The Irish carrier is not yet negotiating new orders with Boeing, as it still has new aircraft coming at it from the earlier 
purchases.
The current delivery stream runs to 2012, by which time Mr O'Leary is confident the Irish carrier will have become 
the biggest short-haul carrier in Europe. At present it is still smaller - measured by passenger numbers - in Europe 
than Air France-KLM and Lufthansa. But Mr O'Leary made clear yesterday he may be back for more orders later, 
when the still impressive Boeing and Airbus backlogs have started to melt away as the recession deepens. And he 
Budget airline revels in troubled times
is hopeful, too, that recession will eventually bring the prices of long-haul aircraft tumbling down, so he can launch 
his separate plan to start a new company, unconnected to Ryanair, for a low fare, long-haul airline operating across 
the North Atlantic.
That point may still be 12-18 months away, and it would take another 12-18 months for the long-haul airline to be 
launched with an eventual fleet of 60 long-haul jets, Mr O'Leary said yesterday.
But, in the meantime, he feels the market and the recession are again working in his favour.
In the early summer, though, Mr O'Leary was not looking nearly as confident. For long months he had chosen not to 
hedge Ryanair's fuel requirements in the firm belief that the huge surge in fuel prices was not sustainable. Without 
any hedges the airline was looking increasingly exposed, however, as the crude oil price climbed inexorably, finally 
peaking at $147 a barrel in July.
His nerve broke and he took out hedges for the current quarter from October to December for 80 per cent of the 
requirements at $124 a barrel.
But since then the oil price has tumbled. The O'Leary view has been vindicated. It was just the timing that was a 
little out.
The result was clear yesterday. The group has taken all of the pain of the oil price rise in the current financial year 
to the end of March. Profits in the first half fell steeply as the fuel bill more than doubled to more than 50 per cent of 
total operating expenses.
For the full year, Mr O'Leary said he was confident the group would break even. That is a huge reverse from last 
year's record earnings, although the group traditionally outperforms its most dire forecasts.
But now that the oil price has fallen, Ryanair feels it can benefit from a strong tail wind in the next financial year.
It has already locked away 25 per cent of its fuel requirements for the first half at $77 a barrel compared with the 
$125 a barrel it paid in the same period this year.
"If oil prices remain at approximately $80 a barrel next year, then our earnings will rebound strongly," Mr O'Leary 
said.
The O'Leary vision is for a rationalised European airline industry with only four real players, Air France-KLM, 
Lufthansa, British Airways and Ryanair.

Now that the oil price has fallen, Ryanair feels it can benefit from a strong tail wind in the next financial year. It has 
already locked away 25 per cent of its fuel requirements for the first half at $77 a barrel compared with the $125 a 
barrel it paid in the same period this year.
Howard MiIlar, chief financial officer, said that if the oil price averages around $80 a barrel next year compared with 
an average of $110 this year, it will make savings of EUR420m (£336m).
How much of that shows up in the bottom line will depend on what happens to average fare levels. During the 
winter season, the group is intent on ploughing the savings on fuel into lower fares, which could fall by 15 to 20 per 
cent in the second half, said Mr O'Leary.
"We expect continuing bankruptcies and consolidations to create even more opportunities for Ryanair to grow," said 
Mr O'Leary.
Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at RBS, said he had long-term doubts about the Ryanair model, from its 
dependence on local government financial support at many airports to its relations with staff and passengers.
The doubts were on hold in recession, however. As airlines went bankrupt, airports would be eager for Ryanair 
flights, pilots were in oversupply and passengers were trading down to the cheapest fares.

Airline's chief plans to repeat his success of the last recession with his low-cost model, writes Kevin Done
Body
Michael O'Leary is in an ebullient mood. The Ryanair chief executive could hardly speak fast enough yesterday in 
his eagerness to reel off all the airline collapses and takeover deals of recent months, as the wave of consolidation 
accelerates.
He believes opportunities are beckoning for Europe's largest low-cost carrier and he was revelling in the prospect of 
deepening recession.
During the last airline recession in the wake of the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, Ryanair made a 
grab for market share in Europe, driving down fares in order to drive up passenger numbers. It is setting out to 
repeat the same trick.
As others retrenched last time, Ryanair accepted a temporary blow to its profitability as it expanded the fleet and 
opened new routes and bases.
In January 2002, as the lines of grounded jets parked in the US deserts stretched to the horizon, Ryanair placed an 
order for 100 Boeing 737-800 jets with options for another 50.
It squeezed out of the US aircraft maker - at the time desperate for new orders - discounts that Mr O'Leary gleefully 
described as "rapacious".
The Irish carrier is not yet at the point where it is negotiating new orders with Boeing. The current delivery stream 
runs to 2012, by which time Mr O'Leary is confident Ryanair will have become the biggest short-haul carrier in 
Europe.
At present it is still smaller in Europe, in terms of passenger numbers than Air France-KLM and Lufthansa.
Opportunities beckon for low-cost carrier
But he made clear yesterday he might be back for more orders later, when the Boeing and Airbus backlogs have 
started to melt away.
He is hopeful recession will bring the prices of widebody, long-haul aircraft tumbling down so he can launch his 
separate plan to start a new company, unconnected to Ryanair, for a low-fare, long-haul airline operating across the 
North Atlantic.
Mr O'Leary feels the market and the recession are again working in his favour.
In the summer he was not looking nearly as confident. For many months he had chosen not to hedge Ryanair's fuel 
requirements in the belief that the surge in fuel prices was not sustainable.
Without any hedges the airline was looking exposed, as the crude oil price peaked at $147 a barrel in July.
His nerve broke and he took out hedges for the current quarter from October to December for 80 per cent of the 
airline's requirements at $124 a barrel.
But since then the oil price has tumbled. The O'Leary view has finally been vindicated. It was the timing that was a 
little out.
The result was clear yesterday. The group has taken all of the pain of the oil price rise in the current financial year 
to the end of March. Profits in the first half fell steeply as the fuel bill more than doubled to account for more than 50 
per cent of total operating expenses. For the full year Mr O'Leary said he was confident the group would break 
even, a huge reverse from last year's record earnings, although Ryanair traditionally outperforms its most dire 
forecasts.
Now the oil price has fallen, Ryanair feels it can benefit from a strong tail wind in the next financial year. It has 
already locked away 25 per cent of its fuel requirements for the first half at $77 a barrel, compared with the $125 a 
barrel it paid in the same period this year.
Howard Millar, chief financial officer, said yesterday that if the oil price averages around $80 a barrel next year 
compared with an average of $110 this year, the group will make savings of EUR420m (m$530).
How much of that shows up in the bottom line will depend on what happens to average fare levels. For the moment 
during the current winter season the group is intent on ploughing the savings on fuel into lower fares, which could 
fall by 15 to 20 per cent in the second half. "We expect continuing bankruptcies and consolidations to create even 
more opportunities for Ryanair to grow," Mr O'Leary said.
Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at RBS, said he had long-term doubts about the Ryanair model, from its 
dependence on local government financial support at many airports to its poor treatment of staff and passengers.
The doubts were on hold in recession, however. As airlines went bankrupt, airports would be eager for Ryanair 
flights, pilots were in oversupply, and passengers were trading down to the cheapest fares.

Rolls-Royce makes a valid point in carrying out research into customer perception of open rotor technology. Not 
only is customer perception important, but one has to ask how a powerplant choice might influence advertising 
campaigns.
"4 Engines 4 Long Haul" was the slogan used by Virgin in response to British Airways and others who opted for the 
twin-engined Boeing 777. What slogan would Ryanair paint on its Boeing 737s if EasyJet opted for an open rotor-
powered aircraft?
The good news is that technology, marketing, time and money can change customer perception.
Take the case of diesel-engined cars, which 20 years ago were the noisy, slow and unloved option. The diesel is 
now the popular option for small and large cars.

Meridiana, the airline controlled the Aga Khan, said yesterday it had filed a complaint to the European Commission 
accusing Alitalia and Cai, an Italian takeover consortium, of receiving unfair state aid from the Italian government.
Meridiana has some 16 per cent of the domestic Italian market and would be left as the second largest carrier if Cai, 
led by Roberto Colaninno, succeeds in rescuing near-bankrupt Alitalia and merging the state-controlled flag carrier 
with Air One.
Air One, owned by Carlo Toto, also stands accused of receiving unfair advantages in the government's sale of its 
49.9 per cent stake in Alitalia. Ryanair has filed a similar complaint against Alitalia.
Cai last week submitted a conditional offer for Alitalia, which depends on a green light from Brussels. Meanwhile it 
has come up against last-minute objections to proposed work contracts from pilots and cabin crew.

Ryanair shares rise despite profit drop

Budget airline Ryanair reported a 77 percent fall in first-half profits, citing high fuel costs and fare-slashing to keep 
planes full but forecast a strong rebound if oil prices stay low. The company's shares rose.
Ryanair Holdings PLC said its net profit for the April-September period fell to 95.3 million euros ($122.8 million) 
from 407.6 million euros in the same period of 2007.
The profit slump included two write-offs: for heavy stock-market losses sustained from Ryanair's stake in Irish rival 
Aer Lingus, and for depreciating values of aircraft it has earmarked for sale. Excluding those exceptional items, 
Ryanair profit was down 47 percent at 214.6 million euros ($276.3 million).
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said achieving reduced profits "in very difficult trading conditions, with 
record oil prices, is a testimony to the strength of the Ryanair lowest-fare model."
Ryanair shares fell in the first hour of trading on the Irish Stock Exchange, but rebounded to 2.83 euros ($3.64), a 
2.9 percent gain.
The airline's first-half sales rose 16 percent to 1.81 billion euros ($2.33 billion), reflecting its expansion in routes and 
hubs despite the worsening economy. But margins grew tighter, as the number of passengers grew 19 percent but 
the average fare price fell 4 percent.
The number of empty seats rose to 15 percent, a one-point gain from April-September 2007.
Expenses jumped 44 percent to 1.57 billion euros ($2 billion), almost exclusively because of exceptionally high fuel 
costs. Ryanair said its fuel bill accounted for half of its operating costs, up from 36 percent in the same period last 
year.
Despite the current fall of oil prices to around $60 a barrel, O'Leary reiterated previous guidance that Ryanair 
expects to record losses in the current October-March period and break even for the full fiscal year.
Ryanair shares rise despite profit drop
O'Leary said he would use fuel-price savings to discount average fares this winter by 15 percent to 20 percent. He 
said Ryanair which retains cash reserves exceeding 2 billion euros ($2.65 billion) must exploit the economic 
downturn and keep seizing market share from debt-saddled rivals.
"The recession will continue to drive down oil prices and fares this winter," O'Leary said. "We will continue to 
respond with lower fares and aggressive price promotions to keep Europe flying and to maintain our market-leading 
load factors."
O'Leary said Ryanair was currently paying the equivalent of $124 a barrel for 80 percent of its aviation fuel, but had 
no fuel-delivery contracts in place for the January-March quarter and expected to pay much less. After that, he said, 
supply contracts valued at $77 a barrel already have been secured to cover 25 percent of the airline's needs 
through September 2009.
He said Ryanair's earnings would "rebound strongly" in 2009 if oil prices remain below $80 a barrel. He said many 
European competitors had already signed supply contracts "at significantly higher levels than current market 
prices," boosting Ryanair's expected competitive edge.
The chief executive didn't comment on Ryanair's backfiring investment in Dublin-based Aer Lingus, which is taking 
a deep bite out of its paper profits.
Over the past two years Ryanair has built a 29.4 percent stake in its only significant Irish rival, but the hostile 
takeover effort has been rejected by other key shareholders and European Union regulators. Aer Lingus shares 
have crashed from Ryanair's takeover bid price of 2.90 euros ($3.73) to just 1.09 euros ($1.40) today.
Accounting rules require Ryanair to record its Aer Lingus stock losses, even through O'Leary is publicly determined 
to keep building the stake until Ryanair eventually wears down resistance from the two other major Aer Lingus 
shareholders: the Irish government and Aer Lingus employees.
So far, Ryanair has reported Aer Lingus losses totaling 93.6 million euros ($120.3 million). The airline said it could 
suffer a further profit hit of 57.3 million euros ($73.6 million) at the end of this quarter if Aer Lingus shares stay near 
their current level.
Separately, Ryanair discounted a report Sunday in a British tabloid newspaper that quoted O'Leary as saying he 
would launch trans-Atlantic services soon.
Deputy Chief Executive Michael Cawley said such a a move was "not imminent," and would depend on acquiring 
long-haul aircraft at deeply discounted rates.
O'Leary has repeatedly floated the idea of launching a sister airline to Ryanair with a trans-Atlantic focus. Aer 
Lingus operates services to several U.S. cities.

Ryanair has this morning posted a deeper-than-expected 30.9 percent fall in second-quarter profit but said it is 
confident of breaking even in the full year, dropping earlier warnings of a possible loss.
Europe's biggest low-cost airline said net profit for the three months to the end of September came in at 185.78m 
euro.
That compared with an average of 190.2m euro expected by four analysts surveyed by Reuters.
"If oil prices remain at approx. USD 80 per barrel next year then our earnings will rebound strongly," chief executive 
Michael O'Leary said in a statement. Ryanair plans to keep cutting fares aggressively to snatch business from rivals 
struggling in the economic downturn, with average fares in the second half expected to fall by between 15-20 
percent, leading to losses in each of those two quarters. "Our full year average fare could fall by almost 12 percent, 
although these lower fares will be largely offset by lower fuel costs (currently USD 73 per barrel in Q4)," O'Leary 
said. The Dublin-based airline has taken a hedge for 25 percent of its fuel needs for the first half of the 2010 fiscal 
year at an average USD 77 per barrel. The airline said its profits for the half year to September were 215m euro, 
down 47pc. Half year fuel costs more than doubled from 392.7m euro to 788.5m euro. Traffic grew by 19pc for the 
six months to 32m, as average fares (incl. bag charges) fell by 4pc to 47 euro, while total revenues grew by 16pc to 
1.8bn euro. Costs excluding fuel fell by 6pc, (incl. fuel they rose 21pc ), despite a 2pc increase in average sector 
length. "The recession will continue to drive down oil prices and fares this winter," O'Leary said. "We will continue to 
respond with lower fares and aggressive price promotions to keep Europe flying and to maintain our market leading 
load factors. "Although we have limited visibility, we now believe that average fares in the second half will fall by 
between 15pc and 20pc, leading to losses in the 3rd and 4th quarters. "Our full year average fare could fall by 
almost 12pc, although these lower fares will be largely offset by lower fuel costs (currently USD73 in Q4). "As a 
result our previous guidance remains unchanged and we remain confident that we will break even for the full year.

"We expect continuing bankruptcies and consolidations to create even more opportunities for Ryanair to grow. If oil 
prices remain at approx. USD 80 next year then our earnings will rebound strongly. "We have a significant cost 
advantage over our competitors many of whom have hedged fuel next year at significantly higher levels than 
current market prices. "This will force competitors to further increase airfares and widen the price gap between 
them and Ryanair's lowest fares." Copyright: Business World and Thomson Financial

Michael O'Leary said in a statement. Ryanair plans to keep cutting fares aggressively to snatch business from rivals 
struggling in the economic downturn, with average fares in the second half expected to fall by between 15-20 
percent, leading to losses in each of those two quarters. "Our full year average fare could fall by almost 12 percent, 
although these lower fares will be largely offset by lower fuel costs (currently USD 73 per barrel in Q4)," O'Leary 
said. The Dublin-based airline has taken a hedge for 25 percent of its fuel needs for the first half of the 2010 fiscal 
year at an average USD 77 per barrel. The airline said its profits for the half year to September were 215m euro, 
down 47pc. Half year fuel costs more than doubled from 392.7m euro to 788.5m euro. Traffic grew by 19pc for the 
six months to 32m, as average fares (incl. bag charges) fell by 4pc to 47 euro, while total revenues grew by 16pc to 
1.8bn euro. Costs excluding fuel fell by 6pc, (incl. fuel they rose 21pc ), despite a 2pc increase in average sector 
length. "The recession will continue to drive down oil prices and fares this winter," O'Leary said. "We will continue to 
respond with lower fares and aggressive price promotions to keep Europe flying and to maintain our market leading 
load factors. "Although we have limited visibility, we now believe that average fares in the second half will fall by 
between 15pc and 20pc, leading to losses in the 3rd and 4th quarters. "Our full year average fare could fall by 
almost 12pc, although these lower fares will be largely offset by lower fuel costs (currently USD73 in Q4). "As a 
result our previous guidance remains unchanged and we remain confident that we will break even for the full year. 
Ryanair Q2 profit fall more than thought Ryanair Profiit
"We expect continuing bankruptcies and consolidations to create even more opportunities for Ryanair to grow. If oil 
prices remain at approx. USD 80 next year then our earnings will rebound strongly. "We have a significant cost 
advantage over our competitors many of whom have hedged fuel next year at significantly higher levels than 
current market prices. "This will force competitors to further increase airfares and widen the price gap between 
them and Ryanair's lowest fares." Copyright: Business World and Thomson Financial

Dublin shares dipped in and out of negative territory this morning as pressure mounted on banking shares amid talk 
that government action to take an equity stake in the banks mounted.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 14.72 points to 3,04.18.
The head of a major British owned bank here has accused the government of being in denial over the need to 
recapitalise Irish banks.
Mark Duffy, chief executive of Bank of Scotland Ireland says the country will need to recapitalise its banks in the 
next few months because exposure to the falling property market will undermine their capital bases. "The 
government is in denial but they are going to have to recapitalise the Irish banking sector," he said. Meanwhile, last 
week saw another step towards co-ordinated interest rate policy easing across the globe. We will get two sizeable 
rate cuts this week, according to Rossa White of Davy. Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank 
will cut their re-financing rates by a minimum of 50 basis points. The ECB will soon reach the low of the last cycle of 
2pc, he said. Shares in AIB edged up 2c to E4.23, Bank of Ireland stocks fell by 9c to E2.21, Anglo Irish dropped by 
10c to E2.40 and Irish Life and Permanent slumped by 30c to E2.40. Ryanair has today reported a 47pc drop in first 
half profits for the six months to the end of September - in line with analysts' expectations - as fuel costs more than 
doubled from E392.7m to E788.5m. The airline said its H1 profits amounted to E215.6m, from the figure of E407.6m 
the same time last year. Revenues rose by 16pc to E1.811 billion from E1.554 billion on a 19pc increase in 
passenger numbers. Ancillary revenues, which grew by 28pc to E322m, account for almost 18pc of revenues 
versus 16pc last year. Fuel accounted for over 50pc of its total operating costs as the cost per barrel doubled from 
dollar 63 to dollar 125. The results were well within and slightly better than Dublin analysts had forecast and its 
shares jumped by 10c to E2.85. Shares in Independent News and Media edged up 1c to E0.65 after weekend

Norwegian to pick up where Sterling left off

Highlight: Airline to take on Danish market
Body
Norwegian Air Shuttle is moving fast to fill the vacuum left by the collapse last week of Sterling Airlines, the 
Copenhagen-based, Iceland-owned low-cost carrier.
This week it will open a base in Copenhagen and is aiming to have eight to 10 jets operating out of the Danish 
capital by May, as it scrambles to find more aircraft for its fleet. Some of the parked Sterling jets are a priority initial 
acquisition target.
Largely unnoticed by many rivals, Norwegian has grown to become the fourth largest low-cost airline in Europe 
behind the big players Ryanair, EasyJet and Air Berlin. It will fly more than 9m passengers this year with a fleet of 
41 aircraft.
The group, which first listed in 2003, is seizing the opportunity offered by Sterling's bankruptcy to increase the pace 
of its own expansion despite the threat posed by the economic downturn.
Bjørn Kjos, chief executive of Norwegian, said "it is a huge opportunity".
He said that the group would replace Sterling as the main low-cost player in the Danish market.
Initially the airline would base two jets at Copenhagen from Thursday flying on six routes to Ålborg, Oslo, 
Stockholm, Alicante, Malaga and Nice.
It is planning to add further routes from Copenhagen to London, Amsterdam, Rome, Krakow, Prague, Barcelona 
and Pisa at the pace at which it could bring in more aircraft.
Today it is also starting new routes from Stockholm to some destinations previously served by Sterling.
As weaker airlines retrench or collapse, "it's a good time to expand", Mr Kjos said. "The market [for aircraft] is much 
better than last year . . . There are a lot of different airlines that have gone bust. There are aircraft available now."
Norwegian to pick up where Sterling left off
Norwegian is also posing an increasing competitive threat to SAS Scandinavian Airlines, the Nordic region's legacy 
network carrier, which is struggling.
"They have much higher costs than we have, about twice our level," said Mr Kjos.
The Oslo-based carrier made clear the scale of its future ambitions by placing an order in August last year with 
Boeing for 42 186-seat 737-800s for delivery between 2009 and 2014. The deal had a list price value before 
discounts of $3.1bn.
Deliveries do not start until next summer and the collapse of Sterling has left an urgent need for more capacity.
The group could close deals with lessors for more aircraft this week.
Norwegian got its finances in order just before the financial markets were hit by mayhem this autumn.
This summer it completed a NKr400m ($59.5m) rights issue to finance its deposit for its new fleet orders, and 
agreed a$160m debt deal with Natixis to fund the pre-delivery payments for the first 10 Boeing jets.

Low-cost airline Ryanair saw its profits fall 47%, despite swelling passenger numbers, and warned it could make a 
loss in the second half as consumers tightened their belts.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary, delivering the airline's half year results for the six months to the end of 
September, said his firm's adjusted profit after tax had fallen 47% against a background of 'record oil prices'.
As a result, half year profit came in at 214.6 million, compared to 407.6 million in the first half of 2007, while basic 
earnings per share fell 46% to 14.44 Euro cents.
Profits were impacted by the record rise in oil seen during 2008, when Brent crude peaked at $147 a barrel, and 
O'Leary noted fuel costs were up 101% to 788.5 million.
Putting the rise in fuel costs aside, Ryanair grew passenger numbers by 19% to 32 million, while reducing fares by 
4% to an average of 47. It also grew revenues by 16% to 1.8 billion.
O'Leary said that achieving the profit that it did was 'testimony to the strength of the Ryanair lowest fare model.'
Looking ahead, O'Leary reiterated that the recession would continue to drive down oil prices and fares this winter, 
but he remained upbeat that the group's traffic would grow by 9% this winter, and by 14% in the full year, with the 
company servicing 58 million passengers.
However, he also warned that the group believed 'average fares in the second half will fall by between 15%-20%, 
leading to losses in the 3rd and 4th quarters.'
O'Leary said the lower fares in the second half would be offset by lower oil costs, with the group therefore confident 
it could break even.
However, analysts at broker Collins Stewart said the decline in winter yields was 'a clear signal that airline yield 
management systems are struggling to fill seats and that they are having to heavily discount to stimulate demand.'
Ryanair's shares initially fell 5% after the market opened, but by 08:58am it had regained some losses, down just 
0.4% at 2.77.

Ryanair plans cheap trans-Atlantic flights

Body
Budget airline Ryanair is drawing up plans to offer trans-Atlantic flights as cheap as 10 euros ($12.70) before taxes 
to several U.S. cities from Britain and Ireland, a company official said, according to a newspaper report Sunday.
The Irish airline intends to offer services from London's Stansted and Dublin airports to New York, Florida, Los 
Angeles, San Francisco and Boston, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary was quoted as saying in an interview 
with Britain's News of the World tabloid.
Ryanair Holdings PLC spokeswoman Pauline McAlester said she could not confirm the plans before an official 
announcement Monday when the company's half yearly results expected to show a fall in profits as a result of 
slowing consumer demand are announced.
"Economy class will be very cheap around 10 euros. But our business class will be very expensive. There's always 
10-15 percent who'll pay whatever it costs for a wide seat," O'Leary was quoted as saying.
Last month, the airline closed a base in Valencia, ending 70 weekly flights to the city in southern Spain.
But O'Leary hopes Ryanair could snap up aircraft from struggling rivals to create a new trans-Atlantic service, the 
newspaper said.
"We'll just have to keep flying more aircraft, opening up more routes and offering people more cheap flights," he 
was quoted as saying.

A volatile week on the stock market ended true to form yesterday with a late Dublin rally that saw the ISEQ index 
closing 9.3pc higher on the day.
Analysts have increasingly been scratching their heads to explain the course of the share market in recent weeks, 
and to work out just why individual markets swing so much.
The rise in Dublin was once again well ahead of that seen on other European markets, with the ISEQ ending the 
session 259.59 points higher at 3,029.46.
It may well be that Dublin was simply playing catch up on London, which has just had its strongest week on record, 
though yesterday's gain by the FTSE was just 2pc. The other big European markets Paris and Frankfurt markets 
have also seen turbulent weeks, through they too rose only by 2-3pc yesterday. A continuing fall in interbank rates 
seems to have been behind significant new rises in Irish financial stocks yesterday. AIB added 14c, or nearly 4pc, 
to 379, with Anglo Irish up 27c, or 13pc, to 226. Bank of Ireland did even better with a gain of 37c, or 18pc, to 200, 
while Irish Life and Permanent rose by 14c, or 7pc, to 229. The rise by the banks was, like that of the general 
market, in striking contrast to London, where banks took a pasting after investors registered their unhappiness with 
Barclays' decision to raise USD12bn from the Gulf states. Other shares were also wafted higher by yesterday's late 
Dublin rally. Swiss-Irish bakery group Aryzta rose by another 100c to 2820, while DCC gained 46c to 1199 and 
clinical trials company Icon was ahead by 95c to 1920. The market's only insurance share, FBD, dipped by 6c to 
1144 after amixed set of national crime statistics that showed a fall in the number of driving related offences but 
with a 9pc rise in the burglary rate, a 3pc rise in criminal damage crime. Fruit importer Fyffes was up 1c to 28 after 
its rival Chiquita gave a confident assessment of prospects in the banana industry, saying that the fundamentals are 
strong and that the outlook remains positive. Kerry Group was down 50c to 1750 because of new fears in the 
ingredients industry, where it has a heavy involvement. Analyst Barry Gallagher of Davy Stockbrokers noted that 
ISEQ index closes at 3,029.46 up 259.29
customers in the sector are currrently focussed less on new products than on solutions that can reduce costs and 
meet specific price points. With oil prices falling 3pc yesterday to USD 64 a barrel, it was a good day for Ryanair. 
Shares in the low cost airline rose by 23c to 273. Another strong riser was building materials provider CRH, which 
ended 39c ahead ar 1709 after Goodbody Stockbrokers revised their forecasts for the group. Analyst Robert Eason 
said that despite the poorish outlook for the construction sector, the group's share price remained at an 
unreasonably low multiple of likely profits. He delcared it firmly as a "buy". Housebuilder McInerney fared less well. 
Its shares dropped by 1c to 22 after Davy Stockbrokers said it has still not completed talks with its UK lenders about 
future financing.

A volatile week on the stock market ended true to form yesterday with a late Dublin rally that saw the ISEQ index 
closing 9.3pc higher on the day.
Analysts have increasingly been scratching their heads to explain the course of the share market in recent weeks, 
and to work out just why individual markets swing so much.
The rise in Dublin was once again well ahead of that seen on other European markets, with the ISEQ ending the 
session 259.59 points higher at 3,029.46.
It may well be that Dublin was simply playing catch up on London, which has just had its strongest week on record, 
though yesterday's gain by the FTSE was just 2pc. The other big European markets Paris and Frankfurt markets 
have also seen turbulent weeks, through they too rose only by 2-3pc yesterday. A continuing fall in interbank rates 
seems to have been behind significant new rises in Irish financial stocks yesterday. AIB added 14c, or nearly 4pc, 
to 379, with Anglo Irish up 27c, or 13pc, to 226. Bank of Ireland did even better with a gain of 37c, or 18pc, to 200, 
while Irish Life and Permanent rose by 14c, or 7pc, to 229. The rise by the banks was, like that of the general 
market, in striking contrast to London, where banks took a pasting after investors registered their unhappiness with 
Barclays' decision to raise USD12bn from the Gulf states. Other shares were also wafted higher by yesterday's late

US low-cost carrier Sun Country Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in order to prevent its assets 
from being frozen as part of a US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) probe of its parent company, Petters Group 
Worldwide.
Sun Country, an American low-cost carrier based in St Paul, Minnesota, previously filed for bankruptcy in late 2001.
In its October 6 filing Sun Country listed assets and liabilities of between $50 million and $100 million.
FBI agents raided the headquarters of the Petters Group in September as part of a fraud probe that accuses 
company founder Tom Petters of overseeing a lending scheme involving phoney electronics deals. US District 
judge Ann Montgomery in Minneapolis ordered Petters to be held without bail.
In addition, nearly $3 billion in assets held by the company, its units and its founder, have been frozen. Danish 
carrier Sterling Airways has filed for bankruptcy because its Icelandic investors were unable to continue supporting 
the airline in the wake of the country's financial meltdown.
 The airline has cancelled all flights following failed negotiations with interested parties to secure funding.
 "In recent weeks, Sterling officers, directors and principal shareholder struggled to keep the company afloat. 
Unfortunately, we have decided to file for bankruptcy," the airline said in a statement. A judge in London's 
Commercial Court criticized Ryanair for withholding payment owed to the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) until the 
case was brought to court.
The carrier paid (EURO)7.7 million ($9.6 million) due on October 9 only after the DAA brought legal proceedings 
against Ryanair. Ryanair later paid an additional (EURO)500,000 that it had withheld as part of a dispute over the 
installation cost of self-service check-in machines.
Ryanair still owes (EURO)57,000 to the DAA in interest for late payment of fees.
In an October 21 hearing, Justice Peter Kelly called Ryanair's behaviour "thoroughly unattractive and disreputable".
The judge transferred the proceedings to the Commercial Court list and granted DAA judgment in the amount of 
(EURO)57,000. He also ordered Ryanair to pay DAA's court costs.
Legal news in brief
Ryanair's counsel argued that the carrier was not delaying payment to DAA but simply withholding money because 
of a dispute over the cost of installing ticket kiosks.
Ryanair is Europe's largest low-cost airline. Jordan's King Abdullah II has named Nasser Lawzi, chairman of Royal 
Jordanian Airlines, as head of the Royal Court of Jordan. The Royal Court chief is Jordan's third most important 
position after the king and prime minister. Lawzi was a cabinet minister before heading Jordan's national carrier.

Body
It took Norman the Conqueror 11 years to make his way from that little bit of unpleasantness at Hastings in 1066 to 
the remote town of Erice on the western tip of Sicily, where he spent yet more time brutally convincing locals that 
Normans ruled, OK? I recently got there rather more quickly: from London to the Sicilian capital of Palermo in three 
hours, courtesy of Ryanair, and then a further two hours swooping and soaring through Sicily's fast and empty 
roads aboard the very latest Ferrari. There are no prizes for guessing which leg of the journey was most fun.
Ferrari has undergone much change over the past decade. As recently as the mid-1990s, Maranello's finest could 
be characterised as being fast, furious, temperamental and potentially fragile - certainly in comparison with the 
duller, more staid, but bulletproof-engineered cars at the top of Porsche's 911 range, with which Ferrari's cheaper 
cars were in competition.
But Ferrari's current line-up - the front-mounted V12-engined 599 and 612 grand tourers and its tightly-focused, 
mid-engined F430 and Scuderia sports cars - are from a different mould. The company's charismatic president, 
Luca di Montezemolo, has led a culture change at Ferrari which carries on today under chief executive Amadeo 
Felisa, and which includes more effective management systems and new, highly flexible manufacturing facilities. 
Together, they have elevated the cars to a higher plateau of quality and cost efficiency. The 21st-century cars are 
now beautifully built and have that air of solidity once exuded by almost no one but Porsche.
Ferrari and Porsche are now diverging ever further from each other in terms of marketplace rivalry. Porsche has 
become a manufacturer of more than 100,000 cars a year, whereas Ferrari still produces only around 6,000 and 
declares it has no intention of making many more. The sheer volumes being built by Porsche leave it vulnerable to 
the global banking crunch. Sales are down sharply and still falling.
At first glance, however, the downturn appears worse news for Ferrari than Porsche. But Felisa insists that Ferrari 
occupies a much smaller, exclusive sector of the market catering to the really wealthy who are carrying on buying 
what they want, recession or no recession. For evidence, he cites the order book for the California. Already, he 
says, it stretches into 2011 - and the car will not even start being delivered until next year.
Preaching To The Convertible: A Sicilian tour in the Ferrari California; Pursuits - Road Test
This newest model revives a name not seen on a Ferrari since the 1970s. And it is one of the marque's most 
hallowed. California Spiders (convertibles) of that era - only 125 were built - now rarely change hands for less than 
$5m. In company with half the world's specialist motoring press, however, I was fully prepared to be disappointed 
by its successor.
The auguries were not good. The first "teaser" pictures suggested a bulkier, more lumpen shape than the lithe 
Ferraris to which we are accustomed. The "new" California also represents Ferrari's first attempt at a combined 
coupe /convertible with a folding metal roof - great for flexibility of use and in line with a trend followed by most 
carmakers. But with all the extra weight up top when erected, it promised to do nothing for the handling poise which 
is one of the main reasons for splashing out £143,000 on a Ferrari. Oh, and by the way, added Ferrari officials, 
despite its claimed 192mph top speed, the California, with its front-mounted, 4.3 litre V8 engine, would be quieter, 
more discreet and much easier to drive, via a twin-clutch, seven-speed automatic gearbox, than its other models. 
Yes, they really wouldn't have worries about anyone taking it shopping.
Not the most exciting Ferrari ever to hit the road, then... but almost without exception, the cynical old hands of the 
world motoring press wound up loving it. For a start, the Ferrari engineers' perception of "discreet" clearly differs 
from most other people's. The California might not have the ear-splitting yowl of a 599, but its V8 bark can still make 
people's heads turn 200 yards away. And it really does fly: 60mph comes up in under four seconds. For that, thank 
Ferrari's first-ever twin-clutch automatic gearbox. It does have F1-style steering wheel-mounted paddles if you insist 
on changing gear manually, but it does a faster and better job in automatic mode. Only Porsche's equivalent, the 
PDK transmission, can better it.
In the metal - it is aluminium-bodied, not steel - it is also rather beguiling. The shape bestows it with an asset 
usually in short supply on a Ferrari; a usable boot, even with the metal hardtop folded. There is even a no-cost 
optional rear set of seats, albeit for small children only.
Not least, there is a Jekyll-and-Hyde character to the car. Put its suspension setting to "comfort", transmission to full 
automatic and just stroke the throttle and you have a benign and undemanding car. Flick it into "sport" and engine, 
suspension and steering response sharpen and the car leaps forward as willingly as any of its stablemates. Felisa 
reckons this chameleon-like character will result in 50 per cent of sales going to people who have not contemplated 
a Ferrari before.
He is probably right. Given the way Sicilians responded to the car - had they had been carrying flowers they would 
have strewn them in its path - if Norman had pitched up in one, Erice would have welcomed him with open arms.
The Details
Ferrari's first folding hardtop coupe /convertible
How much - £143,320
How fast - 0-62mph in under four secs; top speed 192mph
How thirsty - 21.5mpg on EU combined urban/rural test cycle

-----------------------------------------------------
MSCI emerging equities could recover to levels around 850 seen just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 
mid-September, Merrill Lynch says, after the index rallied a record 20 percent this week to 567.
Reasons include a doubling in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, cuts in global interest rates, a fall in emerging 
market money market rates and emerging market indexes 'at historic oversold levels,' says Michael Hartnett, ML's 
global emerging markets equity strategist, in a client note.
Despite this week's rally, the index is set for its worst monthly performance in October since the Russian crisis of 
Aug. 1998.

One size does not fit all. When it comes to financial planning, different professions often require a range of 
approaches and have distinct needs. Each week Sonia Speedy illuminates how advisers can meet those demands 
and build further value and variety into their client book.
Why advise pilots? With demand for air travel still heading skyward, there looks to be plenty of room in cockpits 
around the globe for experienced pilots. Captains can earn £100,000 plus, so they can be lucrative clients despite 
the burden of hefty student loans with which some may start their careers.
Business briefing Over 75% of Britain's commercial pilots belong to the British Air Line Pilots Association (Balpa) 
(www.balpa.org ), which has more than 10,000 members. Pilots can also be involved with the Guild of Air Pilots and 
Air Navigators (           www.gapan.org ) and the Transport and General Workers Union (           www.tgwu.org.uk ). 
Other niche organisations include the British Women Pilots' Association.
95% of Balpa's members are male, with 80% aged under 50.
UK airports handled 241 million passengers last year, according to figures from the aviation industry regulator, the 
Civil Aviation Authority (www.caa.co.uk ).
Landings and take-offs of commercial aircraft at UK airports grew by 1.8% in 2007 to 2.5 million. London airports 
make up 58% of passenger numbers.
Of UK airport passengers last year, most were bound for or arriving from Europe.
CAA figures show that 121.3 million passengers at UK airports travelled on UK scheduled airlines.
Passenger numbers on charter airlines have been decreasing in recent years and accounted for 32.2 million 
passengers in 2007.
Total cargo carried in 2007 was 2.5 million tonnes, 8.2% of which was mail.
The aviation industry directly contributed £11.4 billion to UK GDP in 2004 and employed 186,000 people, according 
to a report by Oxford Economic Forecasting published in 2006.
Business background Pilots and the aviation industry more generally are facing a raft of significant issues, the most 
significant of which include the economy, the environment and Europe.
Business class: Pilots
The current economic downturn and the soaring cost of oil is taking its toll on the industry. Already British Airways 
has reported an 88% drop in profits for the three months to the end of June, blaming what it described as the 'worst 
trading environment the industry has ever faced' for the drop.
Other airlines are also feeling the pinch. Ryanair, for example, has warned it may make a loss this year after its 
profits fell by 85% in the first quarter.
Balpa has been working to encourage more honest debate on the impact the aviation industry has on the 
environment. Its report Aviation and the Environment: The Pilots' Perspective shows that pilots have long felt 
aggrieved that the industry is being used as a 'scapegoat for global warming', with hikes in airline passenger tax an 
illustration of this. The report argues that air transport is not a significant contributor to CO2 emissions.
The shift of regulatory power from Westminster to Brussels is also cited as an issue for the industry.
Business pay The salary of an airline pilot varies depending on factors such as the type of aircraft being flown and 
the level of experience the pilot has. Balpa says 52% of its membership earn a basic salary in excess of £50,000.
Captains with Ryanair, for instance, can earn £100,000 or more in the UK, and first officers can earn £70,000 or 
more. Salary levels for Easyjet are set out below.
Business brains Balpa Financial Solutions, West Drayton, Middlesex
'The main thing that makes pilots stand out is trying to protect them against ill health. You can't get income 
protection cover for them. We run a loss of licence scheme that gives them a lump sum if they lose their licence, but 
that's a specialist scheme that we offer,' says Peter Gilbert, managing director of Balpa Financial Services.
'Generally speaking, a pilot flying for a main carrier wouldn't have any problem with life cover or anything like that. If 
they were a helicopter pilot going to the North Sea they would have difficulties with cover that's an area we are 
actively looking at to offer our own product for them.
'The younger pilots don't tend to be like this but certainly the older ones want to do a bit of private flying, and then 
suddenly someone wants to do hang gliding or something and that's when you start running into difficulties with the 
life cover. Even private flying some life offices deem that to be a risk. Five years ago you could say that 50% of 
pilots probably did some form of private flying but I don't see it so often these days.
'I think they are flying more commercially than they ever used to and also the main difference is that a lot of them 
come into the industry with such big debts. If you fund [training] yourself, you're talking typically £80,000.
'For pensions, pilots are pretty much the same as the general populace: they're a mixed bag. They used to be fairly 
unique two or three years ago because they retired fairly young typically at 55 but that's all changed now [with age 
discrimination legislation]. So most of them have a retirement age of 65 and they've got a mixture some have got 
defined benefits and some have got defined contribution schemes.
'I wouldn't say that they're adventurous people because of the nature of their job, they can't afford to be. I think 
they're very much risk assessment people, with above average intelligence. But I'd say that, as a cross section, you 
get the same types of people in the pilot group as you do in the population as a whole.
'From the contact point of view, I think they're better than the general populace because you've got a chance of 
contacting them 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday. We find email is a very good form of communication with them 
because they can pick that up when they're down route.'

With oil crisis behind it, airlines face falling traffic
With oil crisis behind it, airlines face falling traffic

Highlight: News Analysis
Capacity cuts and consolidation are the industry's order of the day, writes Kevin Done
Body
In the airline world one crisis soon replaces another. The sharp decline in fuel prices is bringing some relief to the 
world's hard-pressed carriers, many of which were fighting for survival in the summer because of the record oil 
prices.
But the gains on the fuel front are being offset by falling traffic volumes, as recession looms in some of the biggest 
air travel markets.
The global aviation map is changing and consolidation accelerating as weaker airlines collapse. More than 30 have 
gone this year, says Iata, the airline industry trade association; 20 more are on the watchlist. Airlines managers are 
grounding aircraft to cut capacity.
Germany's Lufthansa, the main predator in Europe, yesterday announced its long-awaited takeover of BMI British 
Midland, only hours after Danish low cost carrier Sterling Airlines said it was filing for bankruptcy.
Financial turmoil and the job losses in the banking sector are taking their toll, especially on business travel, the key 
profit generator for many of the world's traditional network carriers. The credit squeeze is forcing up the price of 
financing new aircraft, where funds are still available. The strengthening of the dollar against the euro and the 
pound is eroding some of the gains from the falling dollar price of fuel, especially for European carriers.
Some countries that were performing most strongly are leading the way down. Airline traffic in India fell 19 per cent 
in September.Air China reported September passenger traffic volumes down by 7.9 per cent.
Indian carriers, hurt by some of the world's highest jet fuel taxes, face such high losses that they are scrambling to 
consolidate after the wild years of expansion and have been forced to seek a deal with the government to delay 
paying overdue fuel bills. Rivals Jet Airways and Kingfisher have been forced into an alliance.
With oil crisis behind it, airlines face falling traffic
In Europe, even airlines with contrasting business models such as British Airways and Ryanair have, in a matter of 
months, gone from record profits to barely breaking even. Air France-KLM, the world's largest airline by revenues, 
and Lufthansa, the number two European player, are the latest to issue profit warnings.
The squeeze is forcing the pace of regional consolidation. Lufthansa is busiest with Brussels Airlines and BMI in the 
bag and stakes in Austrian Airlines, Alitalia and possibly SAS in its sights. BA is negotiating a merger with Spain's 
Iberia, although the plunge in the UK carrier's share price and worries about the size of its pension deficit could 
torpedo the deal. Air France-KLM is bidding against Lufthansa for a minority stake in a restructured Alitalia.
Consolidation is a particular feature in the US. Delta Air Lines says it is on track to complete its takeover of 
Northwest Airlines by the end of this year to create the biggest North American carrier.
US carriers have led the way in reducing capacity drastically for the coming winter. The cuts were forced originally 
by the surge in oil prices in the first half of the year; US carriers have on average the oldest fleets among airlines in 
the developed economies. The oil price has fallen from a July peak of $147 to about $60 a barrel but the capacity 
reductions remain timely given the falling demand for air travel.
As the crisis deepens, the lines of older aircraft parked in the US deserts are growing for the first time since 2005.
Since June, the world's airlines have announced, and begun to implement, a fleet reduction programme that 
already accounts for 1,083 aircraft, or 5 per cent of the global fleet, according to Ascend, the aviation consultancy.
About 75 per cent of fleet reductions are occurring in North America, where the airlines are cutting 10 per cent of 
their capacity, according to Eddy Pieniazek, Ascend director. Europe is cutting under 3 per cent of its capacity to 
date and Asia 2 per cent.
Airlines are inevitably uncertain as to the depth and the length of the coming recession. But Giovanni Bisignani, 
director general of Iata, says the sharp decline in passenger and cargo traffic in September is "alarming" and for the 
time being it is outpacing industry actions to cut capacity.
Aircraft values and lease rates are also falling, a sure sign of the mounting troubles. "We are only just beginning to 
see the impact of the economic slowdown and the financial crisis on aircraft values and lease rates," says Mr 
Pieniazek.
According to Ascend, lease rates for out of production narrow body jets have fallen by 20 per cent since the middle 
of the year, while rates for short-haul jets in production are down by 10 per cent. Overall aircraft values have fallen 
by 5 to 10 per cent.
Airbus and Boeing are preparing to step in as lenders of last resort to support selected sales during the coming 
year, as airlines find access difficult to some traditional sources of finance for buying new jets. Export credit 
agencies in the US and Europe are under pressure to fill more of the funding gap.
A leading European aviation banker says the number of institutions offering finance for new commercial jet 
deliveries has fallen by more than half to no more than 25.
Despite the rapid fall in fuel prices since July, Iata is maintaining its forecast for the global industry to fall to a net 
loss of $5.2bn this year. Mr Bisignani says the drop in the oil price is not enough to offset the impact of the drop in 
demand. "At this rate, losses may be even deeper than our forecast $5.2bn for this year."
In the six years to 2006, the global airline industry suffered net losses of $42bn and only returned to a $5.6bn profit 
in 2007.
According to Iata, passenger traffic declined by 2.9 per cent year-on-year in September, while cargo traffic, a key 
early indicator of the state of the world economy, fell by 7.7 per cent.
With oil crisis behind it, airlines face falling traffic
"The deterioration in traffic is alarmingly fast-paced and widespread," says Mr Bisignani. The decline in passenger 
volumes was the worst since 2003, when the industry was hit by the Sars epidemic.

Highlight: Ryanair is expanding the number of routes operating at Trapani in Italy but will now not operate from 
Forli as was previously planned.
Body
Ryanair will base two aircraft at Trapani in Italy from May 2009. The airline also confirmed that it would not open a 
base at Forli, where it had previously planned on operating six new routes.
The new Trapani base will create two new domestic and three new international routes to and from the island of 
Sicily. Ryanair also announced that it will increase the frequency on two existing, domestic, Rome and Milan, routes 
as it transfers the operation of seven existing routes to Trapani based aircraft.
Ryanair's new routes will connect Trapani with Paris (Beauvais), Brussels (Charleroi), Oslo (Torp), Venice (Treviso) 
and Turin. Existing routes to Rome (Ciampino) will increase to a twice daily frequency while Milan (Bergamo) will 
increase from four frequencies per week to become a daily service.
Ryanair will base two new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft at Trapani which will operate 15 routes to and from the 
Sicilian airport, with the aim of delivering over 1million passengers per annum.

Body
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has said that the company is not hedged for fuel for the rest of the year, according to 
newswire reports this morning.
Ryanair said in July it had hedged 90pc of its September fuel needs at an oil price of USD129 per barrel, 80 percent 
for its fiscal third quarter at USD124 and remained unhedged for its fourth quarter, which starts in January 2009.
'Looking back it was stupid not to hedge on oil but we're not hedged for the remainder of the year and that's a good 
move,' O'Leary told the Irish Examiner newspaper in an interview.
O'Leary, who has often acknowledged getting his hedging policy wrong, had said on Monday the carrier would post 
a full-year profit if the oil price remains at USD70 per barrel and that profit could rise to 400-500 million euros next 
year. Oil was trading around USD64 per barrel this morning. Ryanair is due to report first-half earnings on Monday 
next.

newswire reports this morning.
Ryanair said in July it had hedged 90pc of its September fuel needs at an oil price of USD129 per barrel, 80 percent 
for its fiscal third quarter at USD124 and remained unhedged for its fourth quarter, which starts in January 2009.
'Looking back it was stupid not to hedge on oil but we're not hedged for the remainder of the year and that's a good 
move,' O'Leary told the Irish Examiner newspaper in an interview.
O'Leary, who has often acknowledged getting his hedging policy wrong, had said on Monday the carrier would post 
a full-year profit if the oil price remains at USD70 per barrel and that profit could rise to 400-500 million euros next 
year. Oil was trading around USD64 per barrel this morning. Ryanair is due to report first-half earnings on Monday 
next.

The extraordinary falls in the value of Irish shares are now being accompanied with detailed assessments of 
whether blue-chip Irish companies can deliver the earnings that are expected over the next couple of years.
As the clouds of international recession draw nearer, few companies will be left unscathed, in terms of their bottom-
line profits.
Much of the slide in Irish share prices over the last 18 months has been driven by concerns about froth in the Irish 
economy, over-exposure to property and construction, and the exit of so many international investment institutions. 
Last week the focus was on earnings and how businesses could be affected by a global downturn.
Several Irish blue-chip stocks hit fresh lows last week, as the sheen came off even the likes of food stocks - which 
had, up to now, avoided much of the carnage. But just how low are the current valuations placed on Irish 
companies?
The banks have obviously been hit hardest. At  1.70, Anglo Irish Bank shares had fallen by 84 per cent since 
January. They actually hit  1.20 at one stage last Friday. Its market capitalisation last week was at  1.2 billion, and 
the stock was trading at 1.1 times earnings.
AIB shares were trading at  3.20, which gave the country's biggest bank a market capitalisation of  2.8 billion. The 
stock is down 84 per cent since the start of the year and is trading at 1.4 times earnings.
Bank of Ireland shares were trading at  1.54, having hit  1.49 at one stage. This meant the stock was trading at just 
0.88 times earnings and had a market value of  1.5 billion.
Outside banking, some of the biggest achievers in Irish corporate life have found their stock trading at incredibly low 
levels. Kerry Group has avoided much of the crunch up to now. Its shares were trading at  17.55 last week, down 
19 per cent since January.
How low can we go?
At this price, the company had a market capitalisation of  3 billion, bigger than any of the banks, and was trading at 
12.5 times earnings.
Greencore has seen its share price suffer a lot more. At  1.21 last week, it was down 73 per cent since January and 
was trading at just 4.6 times earnings. Its market capitalisation was just  244 million.
Aer Lingus plummeted to new lows, despite falling oil prices. Its shares were trading at  1.01 last week, or 6.8 times 
earnings. The stock is down 51 per cent since January and its market capitalisation is just  539 million.
Ryanair is down 45 per cent since January at  2.54. However, this is still 23 times earnings and gives it a market 
value of  3.7 billion.

Irish shares take yet another beating

No bank is present among the top three quoted Irish companies - a far cry from the days when AIB and Bank of 
Ireland routinely topped the list.
Another week, another sharp fall in the value of Irish shares. This weekend, the combined value of quoted Irish 
companies stood at a mere  37 billion - less than what AIB and Bank of Ireland were worth all by themselves when 
the market was at its peak in February last year.
The Iseq's latest falls dragged the index towards 2,500 - a fall of 62 per cent since the start of 2008 and 75 per cent 
off its all-time high of 18 months ago.
But the Dublin index is a horse of a very different colour from the one that was galloping at full tilt in the early 
months of last year. The banking collapse has resulted in dramatic swings in the weightings that make up the index.
The importance of the four quoted banks - AIB, Bank of Ireland, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life & Permanent - has 
shrivelled as the index has shifted from one in which half of the total market capitalisation was accounted for by 
banks, to one in which the four stocks now make up just 20 per cent of the total.
The league table of Ireland's biggest quoted companies has seen a sea change as a result. Iseq followers maybe 
shocked to realise that we are indeed living in unprecedented times.
No bank figures among the top three quoted Irish companies - a far cry from the days when AIB and Bank of Ireland 
routinely topped the list.
Instead, step forward CRH, whose market capitalisation has withstood the storm better than its banking peers and 
is now far and away the largest Dublin-quoted company.
Irish shares take yet another beating
The index's other highest fliers now consist of Ryanair and Kerry Group. AIB, which hogged top spot until last year, 
is now just the Iseq's fourth-biggest fish. Bank of Ireland, meanwhile, has slipped to seventh spot after being 
eclipsed by Elan and baked goods specialist Aryzta (formerly IAWS) in recent weeks.
It will do little to ease the pain of shareholders in the country's banks to learn that the devastation wreaked on their 
share prices means that the combined value of Kerry and Aryzta now exceeds that of AIB and Bank of Ireland.
Despite what appear to be anomalous valuations of the banks, with conventional measures such as price/earnings 
ratios and dividend yields now far removed from historical norms, it appears that it is an absence of buyers, almost 
regardless of prevailing share prices, that has compounded the misery of Irish shareholders.
Instead, investors have factored in threats to future dividend streams - including the potential suspension of 
dividends from banks that take part in the government guarantee scheme - and the increased likelihood of major 
losses from bad loans as reasons not to buy in the current climate.
Even spectacular bounces in recent weeks, on the back of government and regulatory intervention to provide the  
500 billion guarantee and force a ban on short-selling, have quickly dissipated, sending bank shares back to levels 
not seen since the early1 990s. ''Shorters are obviously not the problem," said Paul Sommerville, head of private 
clients at spread betting firm Delta Index. ''The lack of buyers for overpriced assets is the problem."
Even after falls in Irish banking stocks of more than 90 per cent from their peak, however, perceptions that their 
share prices could still be too high remain.
While collapsing share values are not a problem unique to the Irish market, the Iseq's former reliance on banking 
stocks has made the index one of the worst-performing in Europe this year.
Its 62 per cent fall easily outpaced falls of between 40 per cent and 50 per cent in the main European indices, such 
as the FTSE (down 40 per cent), Frankfurt's Dax (down 47 per cent) and the French CAC 40 (down 43 per cent).
The Dow, meanwhile, is down 37 per cent and the S&P 500 was trading 40 per cent off year-to-date last week.
But it could yet get worse, according to Sommerville, who said that a global unwind of leveraged investments was 
still in train and that betting on further price falls was likely to payoff in the current climate.
''We don't think this sell-off is complete. We totally disagree that government stimulus packages are going to help. 
We don't agree with the 'buy and hold' strategy''.
Investors that have held on in the face of the storm that has gone before will hope for a different outcome. But they 
have been hoping in vain for a long time now.

The collapse in Irish bank shares has resulted in a major rebalancing of the Iseq index, with CRH, Ryanair and 
Kerry Group now the three biggest quoted Irish companies by market capitalisation.
AIB, which was the biggest company at the start of 2008, has dropped to fourth place after its share price fell by 80 
per cent during the year. Bank of Ireland, meanwhile, is now just the seventh biggest quoted Irish company after 
being eclipsed by Elan and baked goods group Aryzta, the former IAWS.
The sell-off of Irish bank shares means CRH now accounts for almost 25 per cent of the Iseq index - more than the 
combined weightings of the four quoted Irish banks - AIB, Bank of Ireland, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life and 
Permanent. These account for just 20 per cent.
CRH's market capitalisation of almost  8 billion last week - a fall of 30 per cent on its value at the start of the year - 
puts it at double the size of the next largest Iseq member, Ryanair, worth just under  4 billion. Kerry Group recently 
overtook AIB with a market capitalisation of more than  3 billion.
The emergence of food companies has resulted in Ireland's two biggest food groups, Kerry and Aryzta, becoming 
worth more than the big two banks.

The logical course is cuts, but logic isn't part of what we are.
The people are speaking, and they're not happy. This being a democracy, surely those in power need to adjust their 
policies accordingly - or step aside for those who will.
Should we not recognise Wicklow independent TD Joe Behan as a brave and heroic defender of what is right and 
applaud the actions of the leaders of the opposition?
In normal times, you would have to say yes. The problem is that these are not normal times. An international 
recession is looming. The end of our obsession with buying houses - no matter what their quality or price - has 
combined with this to land us neck-deep in a highly unpleasant substance.
Unless we want to book a Ryanair flight straight back to the poorhouse, we need aggressive and comprehensive 
action to cut the public deficit - and we need it now.
You would think that a national emergency such as this would change the way we go about our politics - that we 
would abandon the 'we want it all, and we want it now' attitude of the years of high growth.
With a deficit made up of the difference between money taken from the public and money spent on public services, 
logic dictates that the public (also known as you and me) will have to hand over more money and get less back.
But this being Ireland, we have no intention of accepting a logical course of events. The over-70s medical cards 
move may have been both maladroit and avoidable, but this issue is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of budget 
cuts.
Every day at 4am in the lobby of Morning Ireland, queues form of the latest groups wanting to denounce the 
''savagery'' of the treatment they are being ''singled out'' for.
Is no one willing to take the hurt to safeguard our future?
Third-level students, farmers, disability groups and the primary school sector already have their campaigns up and 
running. They have all received messages of support from the opposition parties and sympathetic hearings in the 
media. Many more will surely follow.
Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, never a man to miss the opportunity for a bit of populist grandstanding, went as far 
as to denounce welfare, health and education cuts as being a ''stab at the heart of society''.
In effect we have a situation where there is huge pressure building up against any serious cut that might affect 
areas covering over 80 per cent of public spending. This isn't a case of ''Lord, make me chaste, but not yet'', it's 
more like ''Lord, please make someone else chaste, so that I don't have to be."
As usual in Irish politics, the only people expected to answer questions are those in government. They should, of 
course, be subject to rigorous scrutiny but, as a high-minded and given-to-despair Fianna Fáil backroom boy 
grandly likes to put it: ''Why is it that no one else involved in our public discourse ever has to answer for their 
positions? Why do we have a public broadcaster which panders to the public mood, but never challenges it?"
The example given to back this up is the idea that the cuts in the school teacher/pupil ratio is, as the school 
managers and unions said last week, not only wrong and callous, it is actually ''immoral''.
The detail of the cut is that staffing ratios are being cut back to the prehistoric, indeed savage levels not seen since, 
er, last year. Because of rising pupil numbers and technical matters - which only grade-four policy nerds understand 
- there will most likely be more teachers, rather than fewer, in our schools next year.
Another example proffered during the week is the position of the star of the crisis to date, Richard Bruton, whose 
command of economic terms has had members of the Leinster House press corps visibly swooning.
Bruton believes that the deficit for next year should actually be more than  1 billion lower than that proposed by 
Brian Lenihan. So far so good, as this is in line with the views of more conservative economists.
The only problem for him is that he is also against all of the proposed tax rises and every significant cut in health, 
social welfare, education and capital spending. This leaves a gap of up to  3 billion between the deficit figure he 
says is essential and the measures he is willing to support. Simply repeating the word ''efficiency'' like a mantra just 
doesn't wash as an explanation for this disparity.
This is what you expect from the opposition. Why take a brave stand which might cut off growth opportunities?
In terms of raw poll numbers, and the opportunity of a huge win in next year's elections, there is now no doubt that 
the explicit decision to put party interest before the national interest - through a repeat of the Tallaght Strategy of 
1987 - is working.
What does this say about the state of Irish public opinion today, or of our ability to get through this crisis with as little 
lasting damage as possible?
This brings us back to Joe Behan. So far he has ridden the wave of public acclaim and would certainly top the poll 
in any election to be held soon. But maybe, just maybe, some people might start asking why Behan should be a 
hero for saying that he will oppose every cut and demand more spending for his constituency?
If we get through the crisis in the next few years, will Behan be seen as a man who stood against the policies that 
saved us?

Your letters page (12/10/08) had a Ryanair spokesman decrying the ''consumer rip-off Dublin Airport monopoly''. 
We also had a Ms Kearney from Rathfarnham wanting to see a second airport built on Dublin's southside.
The win-win solution is obvious: Ryanair should build its own airport in the southern half of the greater Dublin area. 
It could then compete the pants off the Dublin Airport monopoly by providing an alternative low-cost airport service 
to complement its low-cost flights.

Ryanair is closing its operating base at Valencia only a year after its launch after failing to reach agreement on 
marketing support with the local authority.
In a setback to its rapid expansion in the Spanish market, Europe's leading low-cost carrier said the tourism 
department for the Valencia region had failed to "engage in constructive discussions" and had decided to support 
the local carrier Air Nostrum.
The termination of the Valencia operation, the first time Ryanair had closed any of its bases in Europe, would lead 
to a loss of more than 70 weekly flights from November 4 to destinations in the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, 
Spain, France and Malta and the loss of 750,000 passengers a year at the airport.
Ryanair said it had increased its passenger traffic to and from Valencia by more than 25 per cent this year to an 
expected total of 1.5m out of the airport's total of 6m.
It would continue to serve Valencia from some other locations in its remaining network of 30 bases.
The Irish airline, which is already one of the top three European short-haul carriers by passenger numbers, has a 
reputation for very tough negotiations with airports, as it seeks to drive down costs which are already the lowest in 
Europe.
Ryanair said it would move the two aircraft based at Valencia to a new base to be announced next week and said it 
had received "numerous requests" from rival airports.
 Eastern Airways, the UK regional airline, is to open its first operations from London City airport, with the launch of a 
route to Amsterdam in January.
The entry into the London business market has been made possible by a deal overseen by the Office of Fair 
Trading.

After a wedding party ended in the early hours of the morning a couple of weekends ago, two thirty-something 
female guests making their way back to their hotel were stopped by the police. They were told it was "totally 
unsuitable" for them to be walking at 5am and a taxi was summoned - and dismissed because the driver was also 
deemed "unsuitable."
When the friends whose wedding celebration they had just left bumped into them a little while later, the two women 
were wearing the handsome policemen's blue jackets over their ball gowns and everyone was getting on famously. 
The entire group then went to a nearby bar with the policemen. A couple of hours later, everyone was driven back 
to their hotels in police cars, complete with lights flashing by special request. A couple of days earlier, a cousin of 
the bride's met the mayor on a Ryanair flight. After he learnt of this British wedding party in his city, he sent a 
bouquet of flowers.
I happened to be at this wedding but if I had been asked to guess where in Europe this happened, I would have 
said Palermo. In few other cities in the world do charm - and occasionally chaos - lie so close to the surface of a 
tourist's experience. They say that it is in Palermo that men are most likely to continue the practice of kissing a 
woman's hand. This sense of graciousness extends to visitors. Ask for directions and people will walk out of their 
way to ensure you don't get lost. On my first visit about 10 years ago, I remember an elderly gentleman, all dressed 
up for dinner, following me, worriedly repeating, " Capisce? Capisce? " because he was certain I didn't understand 
enough Italian to follow his directions. Applying for a Schengen visa for Europe recently at the Italian consulate in 
London, I was lucky enough to be facing a Sicilian. He not only expedited the process but sought translation help 
from his colleagues to tell me about the delicacies I shouldn't miss.
My Italian friends look at me, baffled, as I recount stories from visits to Palermo. One who lives in London cut short 
his honeymoon there. His wedding had been on one of the idyllic Aeolian islands, and he found the transition to the 
frenetic traffic and occasional derelict buildings of Palermo too jarring.
My affection for the city has grown into something like an addiction. I now have to ration holidays there because I 
think it unprofessional for a travel journalist to keep returning to a place. Yes, I know the traffic sometimes has all 
the disorder of bees after a hive has broken. And I should be appalled by the crumbling buildings in some parts of 
Enchanting every time Rahul Jacob explains why this charming, chaotic Sicilian city is his favourite in Europe
the city but I am so enchanted by the jumble of architectural styles, from Arab to Byzantine to baroque, that I 
scarcely notice.
This is a city that can claim to have invented multiculturalism. On my first visit, I chanced upon a deconsecrated 
church that looked as if it had once been a mosque, complete with five vermilion cupolas. Sicily's great 12th-century 
monarch, Roger II, was educated by Islamic and Greek tutors. While much of Europe was convulsed by the 
Crusades, he built a kingdom known for its religious tolerance with monuments to match. He entrusted the 
exchequer to Arabs and the leadership of his navy to Greeks and consulted with an Arab geographer from North 
Africa to create a scientific map of the world.
Leave aside the Moroccan-styled ceilings and the fried chickpea flour appetiser served in restaurants that have the 
stamp of the east on them. Even the weather in spring - as Mary Taylor Simeti observes in her book On 
Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal - bears the stamp of a tussle between Europe and Africa: "Dark clouds scud 
back and forth across the sky, caught in a cosmic tennis match played out between the sirocco , the hot wind 
blowing up from the Sahara, and the tramontana , whose gusts have been chilled by Alpine glaciers."
All great cities need great books about them, a soundtrack to the drama of urban life. To my mind, Palermo can 
claim two. Lampedusa's The Leopard is a novel about Sicily but really about human nature. It is hard not to be 
amused by its wry descriptions of, say, the family priest rushing into the bathroom of the patriarch Don Fabrizio 
before he has had time to put on a bathrobe. (Lampedusa observes that the priest was more comfortable with the 
naked soul than with the naked body). Then there is the great ballroom scene. The nouveau riche Don Calogero 
arrives with his daughter Angelica, "a rat escorting a rose". She is soon entwined with Don Fabrizio's nephew, 
however - "two young people in love dancing together, blind to each other's defects, deaf to the warnings of fate . . . 
unknowing actors set to play the parts of Romeo and Juliet by a director who had concealed the fact that tomb and 
poison were already in the script".
This lush yet unsentimental view of Sicily and Palermo is also true of Simeti's book, published in 1986. She arrived 
in Palermo as a young woman from America and, after marrying a Sicilian academic, has lived in Sicily ever since 
(see insider's guide, opposite). I read her book in Hong Kong and so fell in love with Palermo before I had first-hand 
experience of it. On Persephone's Island has the flourishes of a novelist that make Simeti's buying of baskets of 
marzipan styled as seafood to her explanation of the intricacies of the city's faulty water supply utterly beguiling.
But what of the Mafia and the incompetence of the city's bureaucracy? In fact, many businesses in the city over the 
past few years have publicly announced they no longer pay protection money to the Mafia; one of the parties for the 
wedding was at a restaurant that was the first to do so. Still, enter a bank, as a friend and I did one Friday 
afternoon, and you will find that, instead of a queue, the customers have collapsed on the sofas as if under a spell.
Every time I go back, though, I find something new to be enchanted by. On this visit, I found - at last - a hotel in the 
city I like everything about. My first drink at the elegant bed and breakfast BB22 the evening I arrived quickly 
became another. The Milanese owner runs the place like an extended house party. She was up at dawn to ensure 
she had her pick of the best flowers at the market for the wedding party.
At brunch at the Villa Igiea, the eccentric grand hotel by the sea, one of the waiters chided me after I waved away 
his offer of pasta from the buffet table, pleading I was putting on weight. A young waiter was summoned and we 
were made to stand side by side and pronounced equally trim. He caught sight of me making my way back to my 
table with a plate of salad and pistachios and I was subjected to more melodrama.
I go to the opera house every time I am there, whether there is a performance or not. This time the guide, 
Salvatore, was urging everyone to try the echo from the centre of one of the public rooms. Had the opera house 
been damaged during the last war? No, he replied and then almost to himself, repeated: "We are so lucky. We are 
so lucky."
It seemed an extraordinary thing to say of an opera house that was closed for 23 years during a restoration dogged 
by corruption and incompetence. Palermo's charm is that it copes with the slingshots of fate with its sense of 
optimism intact.

Body
Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, today said it has closed its hub in Valencia in Spain over what it called the failure of 
airport authorities to promote the routes.
"Ryanair's investment of over USD140m will be moved to another base in its network which will be announced next 
week," it said.
The closure will lead to a loss of over 70 weekly Ryanair flights, 750,000 passengers a year and over 750 jobs in 
the region.
Ryanair announced its new base in Valencia in August 2007 and has increased its passenger traffic by over 25pc 
this year to an expected annual outcome of 1.5m passengers (out of a total of 6m at the airport). "Ryanair's base 
represented the bulk of growth at Valencia Airport over the last two years and, due to the fact that almost all the 
routes were from international destinations, provided a massive tourism boost throughout the region." "Since the 
establishment of the base, Ryanair has been seeking to cooperate with the tourism department of the Comunitat 
Valenciana with a view to promoting the region across Europe. At the same time as the Comunitat Valenciana was 
telling Ryanair that no funds were available for such cooperative activity, they were granting a E12m award of 
marketing support to the local airline, Air Nostrum, who delivered neither growth nor international passengers to the 
region. Furthermore, the Comunitat Valenciana ignored Ryanair's request for engagement on these important 
promotional issues and indeed more recently turned down all reasonable requests for meetings," the airline said.

European airlines : slowdown hits passenger numbers
European airlines: slowdown hits passenger numbers

Body
Europe's major airlines said Wednesday that the economic slowdown cut passenger numbers in September and 
they do not expect a turnaround in the near future.
Alitalia, Spanair and Icelandair were worst hit as the number of people flying on member airlines dropped 1.1 
percent, the Association of European Airlines said.
The group said this was the first time in 25 years that the economy caused traffic to fall and came after three 
months of slow growth over the summer.
With worse likely still to come as European economies slide close to recession, AEA's secretary general Ulrich 
Schulte-Strathaus said passenger numbers "cannot be expected to recover in the immediate future."
He blamed a "toxic combination" of a slowing economy, declining business and consumer confidence and high 
inflation driven by higher oil prices even though they have come down from recent record levels.
Flights within European countries fell sharply, down 12 percent, while lucrative trans-Atlantic flights between Europe 
and North America did not grow at all. Only flights from Europe to the Middle East and to the South Atlantic grew 
neither of them major markets.
The AEA said load factors the amount of passengers filling up airplane seats continued to slide and this was "a 
massive burden on the industry's profitability."
Italy's flagship carrier Alitalia, which went bankrupt in August, saw the worst drop in passenger numbers, down 25 
percent from a year ago.
Spanish airline Spanair was down 21 percent as the bursting of a housing bubble saw the country's economy slow 
sharply.
Another economically troubled nation's airline, Icelandair, flew 12.8 percent fewer people as the banking crisis saw 
Iceland itself teeter on the brink of bankruptcy.
European airlines : slowdown hits passenger numbers
But Europe's biggest airlines fared better. Germany's Lufthansa which flew nearly 5 million people last month saw 
numbers grow 4.2 percent. Air France saw a 0.2 percent drop in traffic while British Airways saw a larger 5.1 
percent decline.
The AEA represents 35 European airlines, mostly national flag carriers, that carry about 380 million people a year. It 
does not count passenger numbers on budget airlines such as Ryanair or chartered vacation flights.

News In Brief
## Leading stockbroker Kevin McConnell of Bloxham has stuck his neck out and predicted that the worst may be 
over for stock markets. He cited the move by the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial countries to intervene to 
support banks and unfreeze credit markets as one of the main reasons for his optimism.
He added that factors which help investors identify the bottom of the market appear to indicate that markets may be 
on the turn. The banking sector appeared to have stabilised. There were also signs the credit markets were 
thawing. Volatility was reducing. Commodities were beginning to stabilise. Also the spread between government 
and corporate bonds was falling. - Irish Independent
## The Aer Lingus website crashed for more than two hours yesterday follow a surge in booking activity from 
bargain hunters responding to the airline's first "no fare" offer. Borrowing a marketing ploy commonly associated 
with Ryanair, the airline yesterday started a four-day seat sale offering "free" flights, to the UK and the rest of 
Europe. Taxes and charges must still be paid. - Irish Times ## There has been a 40pc hike in fraud claims reported 
during the first week of the Irish Insurance Federation's (IIF) anti-fraud campaign. Insurance Confidential, the 
telephone hotline run by IIF, has received 3,610 calls since it was established five years ago. Some of the 
fraudulent cases exposed in recent months included exaggerated injuries, policyholders holding multiple policies, 
insuring the same items and staged burglaries. - Irish Examiner ## The construction industry is to seek meetings 
with the Government and trade unions to convey its "real difficulties" with provisions of the proposed new national 
pay deal. The executive of the Construction Industry Federation yesterday deferred a final decision on whether to 
accept the terms of the agreement until next month. A spokesman for the federation said the executive had 
instructed its director general Tom Parlon to seek meetings with the trade unions and the Government to express its 
real difficulties with the three-month pay pause. - Irish Times ## Solicitor Ivor Fitzpatrick yesterday began a High 
Worst may be over for shares - McConnell Worst Over?
Court action claiming developer Pat Doherty of Harcourt Developments had denied the existence of a property 
partnership behind British projects worth an estimated £150m. Mr Fitzpatrick, and two fellow partners, are taking the 
action over the alleged denial regarding the existence of the partnership, and the breakdown in trust between the 
parties. - Irish Independent ## The Irish subsidiary of Declan Ganley's Rivada Networks has filed a new set of 
accounts for 2007 correcting an earlier set that said he had no beneficial interest in its multimillion dollar US parent. 
The new set of accounts, received by the Companies Registration Office on Monday, state that Mr Ganley has a 
43.2 per cent interest in the US parent. Mr Ganley is the founder and chief executive of the Rivada group. - Irish 
Times ## The number of shoppers hitting the streets fell dramatically last month, although the lure of bargains in the 
run-up to Christmas should give a much-needed boost. Year-on-year figures released by financial analysts 
Experian show shopper numbers for September down almost 4% compared to the same month last year. 
September 2008 represents the most significant month on month reduction in footfall   down 7.7% on August. Last 
week's budget is likely to have a further impact on consumer spending, according to Mark Mullally, property service 
manager with Experian. - Irish Examiner ## Two companies have announced plans to create 40 new jobs in the 
mid-west as part of investments supported by Enterprise Ireland. The computer software firm Avvio is planning to 
create 30 high-skilled jobs in Limerick. The other 10 jobs will be created by Async Technologies in Co Clare. - Irish 
Independent ## Northern Ireland-based camera manufacturer Andor Technology disclosed yesterday that it is in 
discussions with a third party regarding a possible takeover of the company. According to Andor, the discussions 
are at a preliminary stage, and may or may not lead to an offer being made. The approach comes as Andor 
shareholders vote today on an offer from Thorndale Trading Ltd, a vehicle set up by senior Andor executives and 
private equity investors in a move to take the company private. - Irish Times ## Drugmaker Elan has put off the  1bn 
sale of its drug delivery business because of a lack of debt financing, industry sources said yesterday. It is 
understood that current credit conditions led to the decision. - Irish Independent ## Ireland's rejection of the Lisbon 
Treaty has not yet had a material impact on inward investment, but the No vote has caused "absolute confusion" at 
board level in US companies as to Ireland's future participation in the EU, which may affect future investment 
decisions, Paul Rellis, managing director of Microsoft Ireland, told an Oireachtas committee yesterday. "I think that 
the No vote has sent a strongly negative signal of intent not only to our European counterparts, but also to the many 
multinational companies who locate in Ireland because of the access our location and our participation in the EU 
provides," he told the committee. - Irish Times

News In Brief
## Leading stockbroker Kevin McConnell of Bloxham has stuck his neck out and predicted that the worst may be 
over for stock markets. He cited the move by the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial countries to intervene to 
support banks and unfreeze credit markets as one of the main reasons for his optimism.
He added that factors which help investors identify the bottom of the market appear to indicate that markets may be 
on the turn. The banking sector appeared to have stabilised. There were also signs the credit markets were 
thawing. Volatility was reducing. Commodities were beginning to stabilise. Also the spread between government 
and corporate bonds was falling. - Irish Independent

bargain hunters responding to the airline's first "no fare" offer. Borrowing a marketing ploy commonly associated 
with Ryanair, the airline yesterday started a four-day seat sale offering "free" flights, to the UK and the rest of 
Europe. Taxes and charges must still be paid. - Irish Times ## There has been a 40pc hike in fraud claims reported 
during the first week of the Irish Insurance Federation's (IIF) anti-fraud campaign. Insurance Confidential, the 
telephone hotline run by IIF, has received 3,610 calls since it was established five years ago. Some of the 
fraudulent cases exposed in recent months included exaggerated injuries, policyholders holding multiple policies, 
insuring the same items and staged burglaries. - Irish Examiner ## The construction industry is to seek meetings 
with the Government and trade unions to convey its "real difficulties" with provisions of the proposed new national 
pay deal. The executive of the Construction Industry Federation yesterday deferred a final decision on whether to 
accept the terms of the agreement until next month. A spokesman for the federation said the executive had

real difficulties with the three-month pay pause. - Irish Times ## Solicitor Ivor Fitzpatrick yesterday began a High

sale of its drug delivery business because of a lack of debt financing, industry sources said yesterday. It is 
understood that current credit conditions led to the decision. - Irish Independent ## Ireland's rejection of the Lisbon 
Treaty has not yet had a material impact on inward investment, but the No vote has caused "absolute confusion" at 
board level in US companies as to Ireland's future participation in the EU, which may affect future investment

the No vote has sent a strongly negative signal of intent not only to our European counterparts, but also to the many 
multinational companies who locate in Ireland because of the access our location and our participation in the EU 
provides," he told the committee. - Irish Times

Ryanair widens its attack on the Italian market

Ryanair is stepping up the attack by European airlines on the Italian market to take advantage of the parlous state 
of Alitalia.
It said it was planning to open two new bases on Sardinia at Alghero and Cagliari, in March next year. The two 
bases will create eight new domestic and 11 new international routes to and from the island.
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said it was also increasing its services between Rome Ciampino and the Milan 
region to five a day from late next month and was adding a new twice-daily domestic service between Rome and 
Trapani in Sicily in December.
Alghero and Cagliari will become the group's sixth and seventh bases in Italy with locally based aircraft in addition 
to Rome, MilanBergamo, Pisa, Bologna and Forli.
It said it would base one 189-seat Boeing737-800 in Alghero and would operate a total of 18 routes to and from the 
north Sardinian city with two aircraft based at the Cagliari base offering 19 routes initially.
The latest expansion by Ryanair follows last month's announcement by Germany's Lufthansa that it was moving 
into the north Italian market with a plan to base six Airbus A319 short-haul jets at Milan Malpensa airport in order to 
set up a network of direct point-to-point services between Milan and leading European cities.
The move is the first by the German group to establish a base outside its national market to serve other countries 
rather than to feed passenger traffic into its main hubs at Frankfurt and Munich.
Lufthansa said it would begin flights in February from Malpensa to Barcelona, Brussels, Budapest, Bucharest, 
Madrid and Paris. It was planning to add flights from Milan to London and Lisbon from the summer season next 
year.
Lufthansa's Milan-based aircraft will be operated by its Italian subsidiary Air Dolomiti, which hitherto has largely 
acted as a feeder airline into the group's Munich hub.
Ryanair widens its attack on the Italian market
As the Alitalia operation shrinks amid restructuring and mounting losses several of Europe's strongest carriers are 
rapidly increasing their operations in Italy to take advantage of the vacuum.
EasyJet, the UK low-cost carrier that opened a base at Milan Malpensa in March 2006, is increasing its presence 
from 11 to 15 Airbus A319s by the end of the year.

Ryanair 's Italy base plan trades on Alitalia woes
Ryanair's Italy base plan trades on Alitalia woes

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will open two new bases in Italy in March next year, it said on Tuesday, expanding 
further in its second-largest market and capitalising on the woes of bankrupt national airline Alitalia.
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said it would open bases in the Sardinian cities of Alghero and Cagliari to ply eight 
domestic and 11 international routes. It also plans to increase daily flights on the lucrative Rome-Milan route to five.
That comes as a government-backed Italian investor group tries to relaunch Italy's flagship carrier Alitalia by 
merging its best assets with those of smaller rival Air One.
'Ryanair is continuing to grow in Italy even as Alitalia and Air One merge and offer fewer flights and higher fares,' 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told a news conference.
He confirmed Ryanair -- which filed a complaint with the European Commission to block Alitalia's investor bailout -- 
had submitted its interest in any Rome or Milan slots that could be shed by Alitalia as part of its restructuring.
O'Leary, who has repeatedly criticised Alitalia for high fares and inefficient service, said he did not expect Alitalia's 
latest rescue to be successful without mass layoffs.
Ryanair will have a total of seven bases in Italy after the latest additions.
O'Leary said he expected Ryanair to carry more passengers than those carried by Alitalia domestically within two 
years.
Mocking the 'I love Italy, I fly Alitalia' slogan coined by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi while campaigning for 
national elections in April, Ryanair unveiled its own version of the phrase: 'Love Italy, Fly Ryanair'.

Signs of recovery in the crisis-hit global financial markets helped lift the ISEQ 5.6pc in morning trading today.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 152.66 points to 2,934.18.
Investors are hopeful that governments will succeed in ending the credit crisis and in controlling the global 
economic downturn as they pour billions in to the inter-bank lending market and shore up banks.
France is to lend E10.5 billion to the country's top six banks before year-end to prop up their capital reserves, 
Economy Minister Christine Lagarde has announced. Meanwhile, money market rates declined, indicating that the 
efforts of central banks may be working. Comments from the Fed chairman about the need for further economic 
stimuli for the economy also helped markets. There were some signs that money markets have started to loosen 
with US dollar LIBOR declining by 36bps to just over 4pc. The US Fed Chairman also helped markets, saying that 
he would support further 'significant' fiscal packages to help limit further downside in the US economy. It is now 
clear that the US Treasury and Fed will do all in their power to limit the impact/shorten the duration of the US 
recession. Despite this expansionary plan, the dollar continued to strengthen against the euro, falling below 1.33 at 
one point. Bank shares were mostly higher in Dublin with AIB up 9c to E3.50, Bank of Ireland gained 7c to E1.90, 
Irish Life and Permanent jumped 19c to E3.88 but Anglo Irish continued its decline, losing 3c to E2.00 as the 
markets await an expected E3 billion securitisation move. Ryanair was a big gainer with shares up 6c to E2.45. 
Davy said that, unlike almost all other airlines which are moving ex-growth, Ryanair intends to grow its way out of 
the current downturn and take huge leaps in terms of market share. The exercise of ten B737-800 aircraft options 
for delivery in late 2010 was a statement of intent. Shares in Aer Lingus gained 3c to E1.20. Raised-access flooring 
has been one of Kingspan's biggest success stories in recent years. The division's EBIT has risen from E3m in

Signs of recovery in the crisis-hit global financial markets helped lift the ISEQ 5.6pc in morning trading today.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 152.66 points to 2,934.18.
Investors are hopeful that governments will succeed in ending the credit crisis and in controlling the global 
economic downturn as they pour billions in to the inter-bank lending market and shore up banks.
France is to lend E10.5 billion to the country's top six banks before year-end to prop up their capital reserves, 
Economy Minister Christine Lagarde has announced. Meanwhile, money market rates declined, indicating that the 
efforts of central banks may be working. Comments from the Fed chairman about the need for further economic 
stimuli for the economy also helped markets. There were some signs that money markets have started to loosen 
with US dollar LIBOR declining by 36bps to just over 4pc. The US Fed Chairman also helped markets, saying that 
he would support further 'significant' fiscal packages to help limit further downside in the US economy. It is now 
clear that the US Treasury and Fed will do all in their power to limit the impact/shorten the duration of the US 
recession. Despite this expansionary plan, the dollar continued to strengthen against the euro, falling below 1.33 at 
one point. Bank shares were mostly higher in Dublin with AIB up 9c to E3.50, Bank of Ireland gained 7c to E1.90, 
Irish Life and Permanent jumped 19c to E3.88 but Anglo Irish continued its decline, losing 3c to E2.00 as the 
markets await an expected E3 billion securitisation move. Ryanair was a big gainer with shares up 6c to E2.45. 
Davy said that, unlike almost all other airlines which are moving ex-growth, Ryanair intends to grow its way out of 
the current downturn and take huge leaps in terms of market share. The exercise of ten B737-800 aircraft options 
for delivery in late 2010 was a statement of intent. Shares in Aer Lingus gained 3c to E1.20. Raised-access flooring 
has been one of Kingspan's biggest success stories in recent years. The division's EBIT has risen from E3m in 
2004 to E33.9m in 2007, when margins reached a spectacular 17.2pc. In H1 2008, raised-access flooring was the

Hostelworld owner made  18.3m profit
Hostelworld owner made  18.3m profit

Web Reservations International (WRI), owner of the Hostelworld.com site, made a pre-tax profit of  18.3 million last 
year, as almost 83 million people visited its network of websites to book hostel accommodation around the world.
The Dublin firm had revenues of  34 million in 2007,up from  27.2 million in 2006, when profits were  16 million.
The company, which was founded in 1999 by Ray Nolan and Tom Kennedy, had planned to take a stock market 
listing earlier this year, but decided not to go ahead with the flotation.
Last year, WRI's profits were hit by a  1.25million deduction for ''costs related to a proposed financing transaction 
and costs to reorganise the group's legal structure''. It also had ''financial expenses'' of  1.7 million on loans and 
overdrafts.
Feargal Mooney, who took over from Nolan as WRI chief executive last February, said the company was enjoying 
strong growth, both in its traditional business and its ''startup'' Boo.com website, which it launched last year. That 
site combines travel information and reviews with social networking, and had ''great potential'', he said.
The 2007 figures exclude the performance from WRI's loss-making hotel booking business, WorldRes, which was 
made a separate company last year as it prepared to go public. If ''discontinued operations'' are included, WRI had  
36.3 million in revenues last year and made a pre-tax profit of  8 million.
WRI's 2007 ac count s showed that the WorldRes business was sold on December 31 for  1 to a company 
controlled by Nolan. WRI's shareholders can subscribe for shares in that company and, if it is sold on for more than  
1 in the future, WRI and its shareholders will share in the proceeds.
Mooney said the firm had decided to spin out the WorldRes business because it was focusing on selling hotel 
accommodation through the Boo.com site. He said that WRI had rebranded its central Hostelworld.com site and 
recently relaunched its Hostels.com business.
Hostelworld owner made  18.3m profit
While WRI has traditionally made its money from handling online hostel bookings, Mooney said it was broadening 
its business to other travel services and online advertising.
The firm recently formed a partnership with Ryanair to launch a site called Ryanairvillas.com, allowing villa owners 
to lease their properties.
WRI has about 90 staff, with overseas bases in Shanghai and Sydney. As well as Mooney and the co-founders, its 
directors include chairman Fintan Drury, former Aer Lingus chief financial officer Brian Dunne and Mark Opzoomer, 
the former managing director of Yahoo! in Europe.
The company was valued at about  400 million in 2004 when it raised external funding from Summit Partners, a US 
venture capital company. However, it bought back some of Summit Partners' shares in 2006 as part of a corporate 
restructuring.
The 2007 accounts show the firm paid  35 million to Summit Partners for those shares. As part of that process, a 
total of  12.2 million was paid to trusts owned by Nolan, Kennedy and fellow director Paddy Holahan, and a further  
1.5 million was paid to WRI directors and key management.

Swedish politician slams Ryanair for sexy ad

A war of words has broken out between Irish low-cost airline Ryanair and a leading Swedish politician over the Irish 
carrier's alleged ''cavalier'' response to a recent reprimand from a Swedish watchdog.
The controversy, dismissed as a ''storm in a D cup'' by Ryanair, came after the airline which operates European 
routes from airports all over Sweden, was rapped on the knuckles for advertising the ''hottest back to school prices''.
The campaign showed a blonde posing in a girl's skimpy mini school uniform, with open blouse and bare midriff, as 
she suggestively pointed at a blackboard. Sweden's Trade Ethical Council against Sexism in Advertising (ERK) 
slammed the ad on the grounds that the scantily clad woman in the school uniform was used ''to catch the eye in a 
sexual manner that is offensive to women in general''.
The ERK has existed in Sweden since 1988 and is the country's leading self regulating advertising watchdog. 
Ryanair's response has angered one of Sweden's best known feminist politicians Birgitta Ohlsson, a member of 
Parliament for the Liberal People's Party. She suggested a consumer boycott of the Irish airline to punish Ryanair 
for its cavalier attitude towards the ERK finding.
Ohlsson said: ''It's my duty as a feminist politician to name and shame companies like this." She dismissed 
Ryanair's claim that the advertisement was in line with Swedish liberal values. ''It was neither funny nor liberal, it 
was old-fashioned and conservative," she said.
Ryanair said the airline would be sending free tickets ''to boring Birgitta so that she can take a nice relaxing break''.

Tom McGurk is an intelligent man. However, I cannot but feel that he has some trade union blood running through 
his veins.
He does not acknowledge that the now ''privately owned'' Aer Lingus must play by private business rules. No longer 
is the state - and, by extension, the taxpayer - there to bail out the ailing airline when things get tough. Public sector 
work practices in the private sector are like a square peg in a round hole - they just don't fit.
A few years ago, Willie Walsh set about turning things around, and he did so. Stage 1 was completed. Stage 2was 
supposed to be the state sell-off and capital injection to allow expansion and further economies of scale.
The state dithered, management got cheesed off and Walsh was off. Who picked him up? BA. There's a company 
who could see a man with balls, and it installed him as chief executive.
A long comes Dermot Mannion in the same guise as Walsh. However, if Mannion is further hamstrung by the 
government and the ludicrously strong trade unions, he will be next for the exit door.
How is it that the union and McGurk cannot see that survival is paramount? Not protecting jobs at the airline, but 
survival. Now is the time to make the bold moves, be unpopular and come out the other side stronger and in a 
position to capitalise on the upswing. Walsh, Mannion and Michael O'Leary of Ryanair are all tough men and know 
what their job is.
Let Mannion get on with it. It may mean stepping on a few toes along the way, but that is immaterial provided the 
outcome is survival for Aer Lingus.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has said the government must respect the No vote in the referendum on 
the Lisbon Treaty, but admitted he voted in favour of the treaty and has ''no time'' for Libertas, the anti-Lisbon 
group, or its founder Declan Ganley.
''It seems that only in the European Union, Ireland and Zimbabwe you are forced to vote twice," O'Leary said on a 
visit to Brussels last week. ''The vote should be respected. It is the only democratic thing to do."
At a summit of EU leaders in Brussels last Wednesday, Taoiseach Brian Cowen said he would come forward with a 
plan on how he intends to progress with ratification of the treaty. However, he would not be drawn on the likelihood 
of a second referendum.
O'Leary has been critical of Brussels, notably over its refusal to allow Ryanair to buy Aer Lingus and an ongoing 
row over subsidies at its Charleroi hub outside Brussels. He has lodged complaints with the European Commission 
over state aid given to rival airlines and criticised new consumer rights and travel restrictions in Europe.
Despite that, O'Learys aid he was still ''pro-European''.
''I am fundamentally anti the mismanagement and corruption in Brussels. I hate the bureaucracy. But the EU and 
European integration have been good for Ireland, good for business and, more importantly, generally good for the 
airline industry," said.
''I have no time for Libertas or Declan Ganley or that type of fringe group. I don't agree with any of their views. They 
mean nothing to me and I certainly would not be throwing my money at those people. I am very much a pro-
European and voted for Lisbon."
Ganleyh as been working with Eurosceptic groups across Europe on the possibility of running anti-Lisbon 
candidates in the European elections next year, although financing such a group could be a stumbling block. 
Ganley has so far refused to declare himself as a candidate.

So, no carbon levy; kicked into touch once again, this time for 2010 - maybe. Around about now, Green ministers 
John Gormley and Eamon Ryan must be wondering whether their Fianna Fail cabinet colleagues will ever permit 
any major environmental initiatives - something the two of them can point to and say, 'yes, we went into government 
and achieved that'.
For while the budget showed some tinkering around the edges, there was nothing to boost an eco-worrier's hopes 
for major change.
Oisin Coghlan of Friends of the Earth recalls that it was Noel Dempsey who first floated the idea of a carbon levy 
ten years ago, yet successive Fianna Fail governments have since put off introducing one. ''As a result, Ireland is 
facing a  700 million bill for failing to meet our Kyoto targets. A carbon levy would make the polluter pay rather than 
the taxpayer. And it would reduce our Kyoto costs by rewarding all those that reduced their footprint."
Even optimistic EU projections show that emissions must fall by 20 per cent by 2020, just to start turning dangerous 
warming around. Instead, the message from Leinster House is that another two years of prevarication loom.
They're cutting it fine. In a week when Ryanair was once again advertising free flights, there has been a lot of 
pointless noise about Lenihan's  10 airline travel tax. If this take were ring-fenced strictly for carbon reduction 
measures then it might be worthwhile.
However, it's hard to envisage all those stag parties in Prague and shopping trips to New York being cancelled for 
the price of two beers in a typical Dublin city centre pub, no matter what Lenihan spends their money on.
A tax on aviation fuel would have made much more sense, but the excuse there would be that because the rest of 
Europe doesn't do it, Ireland can't well start. Going it alone on bank guarantees worth many billions of euro is 
perfectly okay, but you wouldn't want to be upsetting our European partners on the oul' aviation fuel, in spite of the 
fact that many MEPs want to tax it too. As for the  2 tax on shorter journeys - well goddamn, there goes half the 
price of an airport coffee.
Eco Warrior: Green is out, now Ireland 's in the red
The tax incentive to promote cycling to work is hardly breathtaking either. Every five years, workers will be able to 
avail of a  1,000 tax-in-kind scheme to buy a bike and safety gear. Which sounded all right until Lenihan said it 
would cost  400,000 per year.
So, every year, 400 people get a free bike. Great. At that rate, Fingal (current population: 240,000) will be sorted by 
the year 2608. Then we can start on, ohh . . . say, Dun Laoghaire. Outlying areas might be waiting for quite some 
time.
Sticking an extra 5 per cent car tax on the new, thirstier CO2 bands (E, F and G) might have made sense, if a 4 per 
cent rise had not been stuck on the lower ones (A to D). The whole point of those bands is they were meant to 
incentivise the purchase of frugal engines; A to D should have been left alone, to hurry the move away from gas-
guzzlers.
Of biofuels, meanwhile, there was nary a mention, so a potentially excellent, home-grown method for Ireland to cut 
its transport footprint goes completely ignored. An 8 cent-per-litre increase on petrol might further curtail 
consumption, but I can't help feeling that the people who'll be hit hardest are those who need their cars no matter 
what, because public transport in their area is so lousy.
And a  5million scheme for warmer homes will be exhausted straight away if it is implemented properly - applying 
for insulation grants is something that most people are only too happy to do. The fund will only last if grants are 
awkward to get. Coghlan suggests getting unemployed construction workers onto the case immediately.
''There's an impression in the media that green initiatives are only a luxury and there's no place for them in a 
recession, but they don't have to be punitive, they just require people to adjust. A greener society could also be a 
more comfortable, more prosperous society."
By its nature, a recession forces people to think more frugally and anything that stymies runaway consumption 
should also cut pollution. But Coghlan correctly warns against the instinct ''to restart growth by any means''.
Having awoken fromthe orgy, now is a time for Ireland to reflect. Is it wise, for example, to pour a promised  300 
million into scientific research and development when, besides wind, there are now proven wave and tidal 
technologies out there that others have developed ahead of us?
Surely now would be the time to start installing some of them, making us less dependent on one of our most 
expensive and excessive old-tech imports - good, old-fashioned oil.
Earthly remains
''Saving the planet is not an after-dinner drink, a 'digestif' that you can take or leave. Climate change does not 
disappear because of the financial crisis."
So says European Commission chief Jose´ Manuel Barroso, to an assembly of characters who have probably never 
turned down a digestif in their lives. European leaders cannot agree a package to write emissions reductions into 
law - the 20 per cent by 2020 mentioned in the main piece.
The package was agreed 18 months ago - now, having enjoyed the positive headlines, politicians are desperately 
trying to water the proposals down. Consensus must be reached by the end of the year for the proposals - if there 
are any left - to make it onto the statute books. A 20 per cent cut is regarded as a bare minimum by many climate 
scientists, but will we even manage that?
* The common skate is a flat fish with a long tail and triangular wings. His eyes might be on the top of his head, but 
this is an endearing feature and most useful when lying on the sea bed. However, the poor old common skate is 
now anything but.
Once abundant in the Mediterranean and the north-east Atlantic - our part of the ocean - the skate now finds 
himself listed as an endangered species by Britain's Marine Conservation Society (MCS).
Eco Warrior: Green is out, now Ireland 's in the red
Indeed, only eight out of 47 fish stocks around the British Isles are in a healthy state.
Clearly, those quotas aren't working; on the contrary, the MCS reckons fish loss is accelerating, not diminishing. It 
warns of a coastline populated only by seaweed and jellyfish, neither of which, I suspect, taste remotely nice with 
chips, even deep-fried.
* Still, you win some, you lose some. The poor old common skate might be on the way out, but Steatoda 
paykulliana is on the way in, with colonies established in the naval port of Plymouth and preparing to spread 
northwards.
The false widow spider, which is about half an inch long with red markings on its back, comes all the way from 
North Africa. So presumably the Irish Sea will not pose much of a problem in its plans for world domination.
But be careful - it bites.
* Finally, some great news; a German firm called Ruf Automobile has developed an electric Porsche 911. Now 
menopausal male dentists have absolutely no excuse not to go green.
Their secretaries will love them for it.

Airlines eye more onboard advertising

Body
As airline passengers grow wary, and perhaps weary, of more fees and higher ticket prices, some U.S. carriers may 
look to onboard advertisements as a way to raise revenue without further tapping customers' wallets and patience.
Advertisements already adorn the bottoms of security bins, in-flight television screens and boarding passes not to 
mention ads that have been appearing in-flight for years, such as those on napkins, beverages and magazines.
But Harlan Platt, a finance professor at Northeastern University, said that the number of onboard advertisements 
could soar as airlines try new ways to raise cash. As far as what kinds of ads will likely pop up on a plane's 
overhead bin, cabin bathroom door, or elsewhere, "the sky's the limit," said Platt.
"I really hope the pilots don't have ads on the back of their shirts, but other than that I think anything goes," he said. 
"It's all about taking advantage of an asset."
Some airlines outside of the U.S. have already offered much of their fleet for ad space. Dublin-based low-cost 
carrier Ryanair, for example, solicits ads for its overhead bins, tray tables and aircraft exterior.
Of course what is considered "fair game" for advertising is up to the airline, but Platt predicts a growing number of 
carriers will look to advertising as a relatively untapped method to raise cash without nickel and diming customers.
"If it creates cash for the airline in a tasteful manner, it is going to happen," Platt said. "Every one of those overhead 
bins could have an ad I don't think anything is sacrosanct. The business model of being a bluenosed airline is over."
Tempe, Ariz.-based US Airways Group Inc. is probably the most assertive in soliciting onboard ads it was the first 
major U.S. carrier to put ads on tray tables and is now courting advertisers for its airsick bags.
Ray Neidl, an analyst with Calyon Securities, noted that advertising on trays has been somewhat successful at US 
Airways, but has been "slow to spread."
"Airlines so far have been generally reluctant (with the exception of some foreign airlines) in turning their aircraft 
into buses, but it may come to that," he said.
Airlines eye more onboard advertising
Exactly how much money could be raised by these sorts of advertisements varies greatly by a carrier's fleet size 
and demographics, but some analysts predict revenue can easily soar into the millions of dollars for the largest 
airlines. US Airways estimates it raises about $20 million annually from all of its various advertising efforts.
If the ads are done in an appropriate manner, Neidl said, "it may be a long-term trend to raise additional revenues."
AirTran Airways recently said it is considering placing ads on its planes, but said that it does have some limitations 
on where they would be placed.
"We decided against ads on the overhead bins because we don't want to detract from the brand experience," said 
Tad Hutcheson, vice president of marketing and sales. "We don't want (the plane) to look like a subway."
The company is, however, mulling more of its recently launched seat-back and tray table advertising. It is also 
considering charging a "well-known brand" to conduct onboard product sampling, and said it is willing to sell ads on 
the outside of its planes.
But Hutcheson said the company has yet to find an advertiser willing to shell out the cost of painting the outside of 
its planes, which can run to several hundred thousand dollars.
Hutcheson predicts that ancillary revenue the extra sales gained from fees and advertisements will continue to 
grow, but the money raised from these services still will not be enough to make up for the millions eaten up by fuel.
"It won't solve the fuel issue," he said. "But every little bit helps."

Highlight: No reductions on business class fares
Moves follow Virgin's lead
Body
British Airways moved quickly yesterday to lower its fuel surcharges on economy and premium economy fares for 
long-haul flights, following the lead taken by Virgin Atlantic to cut some air fares.
The reductions match exactly the moves this week by Virgin Atlantic, BA's chief long-haul rival out of London.
BA left the surcharges on business class fares unchanged, as did Virgin. It also failed to lower the surcharges on 
short-haul flights, where Virgin does not compete, despite the big fall in fuel prices since July.
The crude oil price has fallen steeply from a record level of $147 a barrel in July to about $70 yesterday, the lowest 
level since September last year.
Until this week both BA and Virgin Atlantic had maintained the fuel surcharges at levels set in June.
Air France, the leading European airline, has lowered its fuel surcharges twice during the autumn to reflect the 
lower oil price.
Germany's Lufthansa yesterday announced its first surcharge reductions since the crude oil price began to fall three 
months ago, but unlike BA it reduced the levies on all air fares in all classes and across both its short-haul and long-
haul operations.
BA has come under sustained attack from Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier for leaving its fuel surcharges 
unchanged for so long despite the fall in the oil price.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said BA should "end its fuel surcharge scam". The decision to reduce 
only some long-haul surcharges was "just a token gesture" and BA had left the short-haul fuel surcharges 
untouched.
BA reduces some surcharges
BA said it was lowering the economy fare surcharge for long-haul flights of more than nine hours by £13 a flight 
from £109 to £96 per flight, one way. The economy surcharge for long-haul flights of less than nine hours would 
drop by £10 a flight from £78 per flight to £68 one way, the airline said.
It said recently it was still expecting its fuel bill to rise this year by about £1bn to £3bn. Much of the advantage 
gained by the fall in the crude oil price had been offset by the decline in the value of the pound against the US 
dollar, BA said.
The airline has previously kept all its surcharges unchanged in an effort to sustain its fare levels to offset the sharp 
decline in its passenger traffic, but it moved yesterday to close the competitive gap with Virgin.
BA warned two weeks ago it would only break even at the operating level for the current financial year to the end of 
March, wiping out the record operating profit of £875m achieved last year.

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has personally lost up to E350m from the collapse of the airline's shares but is losing no 
sleep over it.
"The shares will come back up again when the global market improve," he said.
A year ago, Ryanair shares were worth E5.65 each. By lunchtime today, those shares were worth E1.99 a piece as 
the stock was hammered by surging oil prices and an economic downturn.
Mr O'Leary is believed to own around 4pc of the airline. Speaking in Belfast this morning, Mr O'Leary described the 
move by Aer Lingus from Shannon to Belfast as a financial disaster. He said Aer Lingus had halted its successful 
Shannon to Heathrow service where the company had load factors of 80pc and established a Belfast to London 
route that is struggling to record 50pc load figures.

Ryanair has called on the UK's Office of Fair Trading to investigate what it says is a hike of 50pc in the price 
charged for aviation fuel at two airports by Air BP.
It claims the rises at Belfast City and Glasgow Prestwick airports are "unjustified".
The low cost airline said this morning that it had written to Air BP to request an explanation for these "rapacious" 
increases.
The fuel company had said the increases were due to "the rising cost of oil". Ryanair said this morning: "At a time 
when the oil companies are making billions in profits each week from record high oil prices, delivery charges should 
actually be reducing, not increasing by over ten times the rate of inflation. "Of the 150 airports at which Ryanair 
currently operates to, Belfast City and Prestwick are the only two airports where Air BP has a complete monopoly 
and where they are subjecting users to this kind of profiteering at a time of record oil prices and oil company 
profits."

The Dublin market sank by 3.5pc in morning trade today as banking stocks fell on fears that the Government will 
take a preference share in the top banks, diluting existing investor's holdings.
By 12:15, the ISEQ was down 107.05 points to 2,916.15.
The Irish market mimicked global bourses in sharp falls, ending a two day rally but with the ISEQ severely lagging 
its European peers.
Concerns grew today that the Government would have to follow other European countries and buy stakes in banks 
to create further safeguards for the Irish financial system. According to Davy Research, Ireland's four quoted banks 
will need an injection of between E11.4 billion and E14.9bn in fresh capital if they are reach the tier 1 capital ratio of 
11.5pc to 12.5pc which has been attained by the British banking sector following the injection of funds by the British 
government. While the government has denied in the past week that it plans to take a stake in the banks, investors 
fear that the possibility of rising bad loans and asset writedowns will force the government's hand. Speculative 
lending to construction and property in Ireland amounts to E39.1bn. Of this, the financial regulator said that "E24bn 
is supported by additional collateral or alternative sources of cash flow and realisable security. This leaves a 
balance of E15bn secured directly on the underlying property". The Finance Minister has revealed that the 
government's funding guarantee will cost the banks around 10pc of profits. This would translate to around E550m 
for the four Dublin stock market listed banks, according to analysts' figures. The inclusion of Irish Nationwide and 
EBS would drive that figure up to around E580m, according to Davy Research economist, Emer Lang. Shares in 
AIB fell by 20c to E3.00, Bank of Ireland was down 21c to E2.14, Anglo Irish declined by 14c to E1.98 and Irish Life 
and Permanent slumped 22c to E3.78. Ireland has followed other EU member states in levying a charge on 
departures from Irish airports, a move that brought stinging criticism from the industry and from tourism bodies.

crude prices with oil futures now down to around USD76 a barrel. The budget also saw Irish betting turnover tax

The Dublin market sank by 3.5pc in morning trade today as banking stocks fell on fears that the Government will 
take a preference share in the top banks, diluting existing investor's holdings.
By 12:15, the ISEQ was down 107.05 points to 2,916.15.
The Irish market mimicked global bourses in sharp falls, ending a two day rally but with the ISEQ severely lagging 
its European peers.
Concerns grew today that the Government would have to follow other European countries and buy stakes in banks 
to create further safeguards for the Irish financial system. According to Davy Research, Ireland's four quoted banks 
will need an injection of between E11.4 billion and E14.9bn in fresh capital if they are reach the tier 1 capital ratio of 
11.5pc to 12.5pc which has been attained by the British banking sector following the injection of funds by the British 
government. While the government has denied in the past week that it plans to take a stake in the banks, investors 
fear that the possibility of rising bad loans and asset writedowns will force the government's hand. Speculative 
lending to construction and property in Ireland amounts to E39.1bn. Of this, the financial regulator said that "E24bn 
is supported by additional collateral or alternative sources of cash flow and realisable security. This leaves a 
balance of E15bn secured directly on the underlying property". The Finance Minister has revealed that the 
government's funding guarantee will cost the banks around 10pc of profits. This would translate to around E550m 
for the four Dublin stock market listed banks, according to analysts' figures. The inclusion of Irish Nationwide and 
EBS would drive that figure up to around E580m, according to Davy Research economist, Emer Lang. Shares in 
AIB fell by 20c to E3.00, Bank of Ireland was down 21c to E2.14, Anglo Irish declined by 14c to E1.98 and Irish Life

The government's move to introduce a 10 euro air travel tax will hurt the competitiveness of the country's travel and 
tourism sector at a time of already tough business conditions, business groups have claimed.
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan announced the move in his 2009 budget yesterday in a bid to shore up state 
coffers.
Lenihan said it is estimated the tax, which will take effect from the end of March, will yield 95m euro in revenue next 
year and 150m euro in a full year.
'It would be regrettable even in normal times, but its imposition at a time when the aviation and travel industries are 
in the most precarious position in living memory is unfortunate and unwise,' said Eamonn McKeon, Chief Executive 
of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation. 'It is another blow against Ireland's competitiveness and for the amount 
of money raised it could and should have been avoided,' he said. Lenihan said passengers will pay a lower rate of 
two euros on shorter journeys, adding that the decision was consistent with moves by other European Union 
member states such as the UK and the Netherlands. 'This new tax will further damage already falling consumer 
demand for air travel and will put Ireland at a significant disadvantage for inbound tourism on which thousands 
depend for their livelihood,' a spokesperson for Aer Lingus said. Shares in the national carrier finished down nearly 
2pc last night while the ISEQ index closed 2.73pc up. Aer Lingus's main rival Ryanair had already urged the 
government this week not to introduce a travel tax, saying that it would discriminate against air travellers in favour of 
ferry passengers. It added that short-haul traffic from Shannon in southern Ireland could collapse as a result. 
'Ryanair simply cannot deliver up to 2 million passengers annually at Shannon if the average fares paid by these -- 
mainly -- visitor numbers is to be increased by more than 100 percent,' it said. Separately, motorists are expected to 
be hit by increases in motor tax rates. The tax on cars with engines below 2.5 litres will be raised by 4 percent,

while vehicles with bigger engines will see a 5 percent tax rise. But Lenihan also said he would be proposing a tax 
incentive to promote cycling to work.

Virgin Atlantic cuts fuel surcharges on air fares
Virgin Atlantic cuts fuel surcharges on air fares

Virgin Atlantic is reducing the fuel surcharges levied on its economy and premium economy tickets for the first time 
since the crude oil price began falling in mid-July.
The move increases pressure on British Airways to take similar steps to cut air fares. The crude oil price has fallen 
steeply from a record $147 a barrel in July to about $77but until yesterday both carriers had maintained the fuel 
surcharges at levels set in June.
Air France, the leading European airline, has already lowered its fuel surcharges twice during the autumn to reflect 
the reduced oil price.
BA has come under sustained attack from Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, for leaving the surcharges unchanged 
in spite of the fall in the oil price.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said last week: "BA is using these high and unjustified fuel surcharges as 
a scam to rip off its passengers."
He called on BA to explain why it had lowered its cargo fuel surcharges but left   passenger fare surcharges 
unchanged.
BA said yesterday its surcharges were "under constant review." The group was still expecting its fuel bill to rise by 
about £1bn to £3b this year.
Much of the advantage gained by the fall in the crude oil price had been offset by the decline in the value of the 
pound against the US dollar, BA said.
Virgin Atlantic said it was lowering the surcharges on economy fares to £68 from £78 on shorter flights (one way) 
and to £96 from £109 on longer routes including those to destinations on the US west coast, in Asia, Australia and 
South Africa. It has left the surcharges on its business class fares unchanged, however, at £98 one way on shorter 
flights and £133 on longer flights.
Virgin Atlantic cuts fuel surcharges on air fares
BA has kept its surcharges in place to try to sustain its fare levels and offset an increasingly sharp fall in its 
passenger traffic. The airline warned two weeks ago that it would only break even at the operating level for the 
current financial year to end-March, wiping out a record operating profit of £875m last year. BA said forward 
bookings were being affected by "the increased anxiety in financial markets and by the uncertain economic 
outlook".
BA was fined a record £121.5m in August last year after admitting illegally colluding with Virgin Atlantic on the fixing 
of fuel surcharges on long-haul flights to and from the UK between August 2004 and January 2006.

Irish air travel tax a blow to tourism - industry
Irish air travel tax a blow to tourism - industry

Ireland's move to introduce a 10 euro ($14) air travel tax will hurt the competitiveness of the country's travel and 
tourism sector at a time of already tough business conditions, business groups said on Tuesday.
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan announced the move in his 2009 budget on Tuesday in a bid to shore up state 
coffers as Ireland slides into its first recession in 25 years.
Lenihan said it is estimated the tax, which will take effect from the end of March, will yield 95 million euros in state 
revenues next year and 150 million euros in a full year.
'It would be regrettable even in normal times, but its imposition at a time when the aviation and travel industries are 
in the most precarious position in living memory is unfortunate and unwise,' said Eamonn McKeon, Chief Executive 
of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation.
'It is another blow against Ireland's competitiveness and for the amount of money raised it could and should have 
been avoided,' he said.
Lenihan said passengers will pay a lower rate of two euros on shorter journeys, adding that the decision was 
consistent with moves by other European Union member states such as the UK and the Netherlands.
'This new tax will further damage already falling consumer demand for air travel and will put Ireland at a significant 
disadvantage for inbound tourism on which thousands depend for their livelihood,' airline Aer Lingus said.
Shares in the national carrier finished down nearly 2 percent while the main index closed 2.73 percent up.
Aer Lingus's local rival, European low cost carrier Ryanair, had already urged the government this week not to 
introduce a travel tax, saying that it would discriminate against air travellers in favour of ferry passengers.
It added that short-haul traffic from Shannon in southern Ireland could collapse as a result. Aer Lingus pulled its 
services from Shannon earlier this year over the issue of costs.
'Ryanair simply cannot deliver up to 2 million passengers annually at Shannon if the average fares paid by these -- 
mainly -- visitor numbers is to be increased by more than 100 percent,' it said.
Separately, motorists are expected to be hit by increases in motor tax rates.
Irish air travel tax a blow to tourism - industry
The tax on cars with engines below 2.5 litres will be raised by 4 percent, while vehicles with bigger engines will see 
a 5 percent tax rise.
But Lenihan also said he would be proposing a tax incentive to promote cycling to work.

Ryanair has given notice that it is to end its hotels contract with Expedia in a row over payment terms.
The Irish airline has confirmed that it has given 30 days notice to Expedia that its hotel contract will end following 
"Expedia's failure to honour payment terms".
Ryanair entered into the agreement with Travelscape LLC (the parent of Expedia) in March of last year.
This agreement gave Expedia exclusive rights to sell hotel accommodation on Ryanair.com (Europe's largest travel 
website) and gave Expedia on-line access to Ryanair's 58m annual passengers. "While the contract operated 
satisfactorily in its early stages, Expedia has been in breach of a number of its payment obligations in recent 
months and despite strenuous efforts on Ryanair's part to resolve the situation, particularly to regularise the agreed 
payments, Expedia has failed to remedy its defaults or honour these contractual obligations. Consequently, Ryanair 
has now given Expedia notice of its intention to end this contract with effect from November 8, 2008," Ryanair said. 
Commenting on this decision, Ryanair's Michael Cawley, said: "Ryanair offered Expedia the unique opportunity to 
exclusively access its 58 million passengers through Europe's largest travel website, Ryanair.com. Regrettably, 
Expedia has failed to honour key obligations under this agreement, in particular its payment terms, and our 
attempts in recent months to get Expedia to resolve these breaches, have failed so we now have no alternative but 
to give them notice.

Body
Ryanair has threatened to close its bases at Valencia in Spain for what the airline called the regional government's 
failure to negotiate.
Ryanair has set a deadline of this coming Friday for a response from the Government before it makes its final 
decision on the future of its base at Valencia airport.
"Ryanair is the largest airline flying to Valencia but, despite its importance to the local economy, the government 
has opted to support other airlines that have not provided a fraction of the growth which Ryanair has to the airport. 
Instead it has chosen to ignore all efforts by Ryanair to collaborate in ensuring the continued growth in passenger 
traffic at the airport," it said.
Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley, said: "Ryanair has once again proven that it is the lowest fares, 
best punctuality and fewest lost bags that passengers really want. That is why over one and a half million 
passengers will choose Ryanair this year to travel to/from Valencia. It is madness that the Regional Government is 
risking the livelihoods of the tourism industry by ignoring our repeated attempts to meet with them."

Ryanair slams proposed E10 air tax Ryanair On Tax
Ryanair slams proposed E10 air tax; Ryanair On Tax

Highlight: Ryanair has slammed a proposed E10 travel tax, saying it will devastate air traffic, especially to and from 
regional airports such as Shannon.
Body
Ryanair has slammed talk of an E10 travel tax, saying it will devastate air traffic, especially to and from regional 
airports such as Shannon.
The airline said that, if implemented, it would be discriminatory if it doesn't apply to competing ferry traffic and that it 
"will deal a devastating blow to the recent growth in low fare traffic to/from Shannon".
In responding to this week's probable tax increases in the Irish budget, Ryanair said that while it would be 
disappointed if such a "disproportionate" tax is levied on air passengers to/from Ireland.
"It is clear in the current environment that everyone, including air passengers would have to shoulder a reasonable 
proportion of this burden." However Ryanair said it would be entirely unfair for the Government to levy such a high 
rate of tax (a E10 tax equates to a 25pc rate of tax on Ryanair's average E40 fare) if, at the same time, "the 
Government owned DAA monopoly continues to rip air passengers off with up to E15 per departing passenger". 
Ryanair is calling on the Government to use its ownership of the DAA to ensure that these "excessive and 
uncompetitive taxes at Dublin Airport were reduced by at least 50pc (or E7.00 per ticket), in order to help 
consumers shoulder at least some of this burden of increased taxation and to avoid Government double taxation at 
Dublin Airport".

rate of tax (a E10 tax equates to a 25pc rate of tax on Ryanair's average E40 fare) if, at the same time, "the 
Government owned DAA monopoly continues to rip air passengers off with up to E15 per departing passenger". 
Ryanair is calling on the Government to use its ownership of the DAA to ensure that these "excessive and 
uncompetitive taxes at Dublin Airport were reduced by at least 50pc (or E7.00 per ticket), in order to help 
consumers shoulder at least some of this burden of increased taxation and to avoid Government double taxation at 
Dublin Airport".

ALAIN WEILL
Body
The dry croissants and plastic coffee cups speak volumes about Alain Weill, France's most intriguing media 
entrepreneur.
There is no starched linen, porcelain or basket of pastries such as you might expect from a French chief executive. 
Mr Weill is a no-frills tycoon who is shaking up his country's stolid media industry from a modest office overlooking 
the Paris ringroad.
The 47-year-old Strasbourgeois has created a media empire from scratch, starting eight years ago with the 
purchase of Radio Monte Carlo, which was on the verge of collapse.
He has since added BFM, another radio station; BFM TV, France's first digital television news channel; and La 
Tribune, a business newspaper he bought from Bernard Arnault, the king of luxury.
Next month he will launch Le Sport 10, a cheap sports daily to take on the mighty L'Equipe, the country's biggest-
selling national newspaper and the best-known sports paper in Europe. He has also embarked on some 
industryleading innovation, notably his central sports news agency, which distributes sports coverage to all his 
channels and titles.
NextRadioTV, the umbrella company, is relatively small with a turnover of EUR130m ($175m, £103m), but its fast 
growth is remarkable compared with its French peers. Mr Weill is a rare beast in France: a risk-taking innovator in a 
sector dominated by industrial conglomerates and public sector broadcasters.
"I am a media entrepreneur. That sounds banal, but it is something new in France," he says.

and listeners what they want, writes Ben Hall
France's snobbish media elite accuse Mr Weill of cheapening the profession with an output of commoditised (read 
American) news journalism. The "low cost" tag, which he invented himself to impress his financial backers, plays 
directly into their hands.
Nonetheless he still believes the description is appropriate. He compares his business with Ryanair, the budget 
airline, saying both have broken into monopoly markets using new technologies to make them more productive 
while investing heavily in new services, but neither, he says, is a "shoestring" operation.
While Mr Weill may resemble Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, in as far as he is an upstart outsider 
beating conservative incumbents at their own game, his manner could not be more different from that of the strident 
airline boss. Mr Weill avoids the limelight and is quietly spoken - his manner is as dry as his croissants.
His appearance sets him apart from others in the media and he wears the rimless glasses of an accountant, and 
boxy, stiff clothes. But he insists it is age rather than character or style that makes him different to others in his 
industry.
"I come from a younger generation than other media owners, particularly those in television and radio who came 
from the public sector. Often, the news media in France are run by journalists who come from that older generation. 
I am an entrepreneur who came to the media industry with the same approach as media entrepreneurs in other 
countries.
"So I introduced marketing of our journalistic content and a much greater focus on what our readers and viewers 
want, as happens abroad. I draw inspiration from abroad, whereas the other media players are more traditional and 
stuck in their Franco-French ways."
It is his focus on what viewers and listeners want - in contrast to the more top-down approach of conventional 
French media owners - that is key to his commercial success, Mr Weill says.
He believes this approach will see him through the economic slowdown. So far, Mr Weill says, his businesses have 
"not yet suffered much" from the tough market conditions but he expects a "difficult" 2009.
He insists that radio is well-suited to harder conditions because it has low fixed costs and advertisers are attracted 
by its relative cheapness. He also hopes that digital television, which is still a new media in France, will benefit from 
the scrapping of advertising on public television next year and should provide extra revenue to his channels.
Radio has encouraged him to innovate with new formats. He turned RMC into a talk radio station, modelled on 
those in the US. The other main French stations have now followed suit.
Mr Weill is scathing about his counterparts in the media industry, particularly those businesses that are part of 
larger industrial groups, which he describes as a "Franco-French peculiarity".
"It is not a very good system. The owners have different objectives. Development of their media businesses is 
perhaps not a priority, or not the only priority. A group like Bouygues has TF1 (television), Alstom (engineering), 
Bouygues Telecom, it is making trade-offs between one and the other."
If France has failed to develop a big pan-European media group it is not because of the weight of regulation at 
home - as many in the industry claim - but because owners are too distracted with other businesses, he says.
"Mr Arnault bought La Tribune 15 years ago but in the end it was not his core business. He concluded he didn't 
have the savoir faire that he has in his own field, where he follows his products and ranges day-to-day with 
uncontestable competence."
A specialist in turning round failing news outlets, partly by cutting jobs, Mr Weill has acquired the reputation of a 
ruthless cost-cutter who has broken France's tradition of social partnership. But he is phlegmatic, saying he has 
created far more jobs than he has cut.
France 's low-cost media challenger The no-frills tycoon has built an empire in eight years by giving viewers 
and listeners what they want, writes Ben Hall
"None of this worries me. I'm perfectly at ease. It is the former owners who are to blame. I take no responsibility. I 
take decisions that are painful for some people but help save the economy."
Mr Weill, whose parents were doctors, wanted to be a journalist but ended up studying management at the Institut 
Supérieur des Affaires. He has spent his entire career in broadcasting, first with Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de 
Telediffusion, which owns RTL radio, and then with NRJ, the first independent radio group, first as director of 
programming then as deputy chief executive. When NRJ tried to take over RMC, but was blocked by the regulator, 
he saw an opportunity and seized it.
While first and foremost an entrepreneur, he takes a close interest in his group's content, talking frequently with his 
editors.
"If there is an image I don't like, I say so. But my criticisms are not editorial or political, they are qualitative. It is a 
taboo in France. The owner is not supposed to interfere. I don't call up and say I've had lunch with a minister this 
afternoon who wants to come on. The only criteria are quality and the audience."
Has he ever come under political pressure to change a broadcast or article, like many other media owners? Mr 
Weill chooses his words carefully: "No, but interventions don't shock me either, if it is a question of complaining 
about one of my journalists, when false things are written."
Perhaps being a newcomer gives him more independence? It's a question of mindset, he replies. Many "excellent" 
journalists who spent their careers in public radio and television "have been formatted to compromise with whoever 
is in power. We don't have a long history, which perhaps makes things easier for us."
Economy class flight that marked the rebirth of a radio station 
Alain Weill knew he had made it when he flew to the 2002 football World Cup in South Korea - in economy class.
Six months earlier, his RMC radio station had pulled off a coup by buying exclusive rights to broadcast the 
tournament's matches. The move triggered a furious row.
"The other stations united against us to denounce us for commercialising sport when there should be a right to 
information. It was the reaction of bad losers. What we were doing was what television had done for years. Football 
matches are entertainment, not news."
Mr Weill recalls being hauled in to the sports ministry to explain himself. He was confronted by other media 
executives. There were earnest debates about the issue of sporting rights. The press was "on his back". "It was an 
incredible period," he says.
"Our competitors were angry that this little RMC, which everybody thought was dead, had pulled off this wicked 
move.
"But for us at RMC this was the act of renaissance. Then the team started believing in it. It really lifted everybody. 
And when we all left for Korea and Japan, all the French journalists travelling on the same plane, we were at the 
back in economy, while RTL and Europe1 were in business, but they were not going to commentate on the games. 
It was quite an image."

Despite the government's unprecedented bailout and an ECB interest rate cut, share prices of the country's biggest 
banks have continued their slide towards the unthinkable.
It got better before it got worse. Despite the short-lived rally that kicked off less than two weeks ago, when the Irish 
government waded into the market with an unlimited guarantee over the liabilities of Irish banks, it did not take long 
for gravity to get the better of their shareholders.
Anglo Irish Bank lost 56 per cent of its value last week. Bank of Ireland lost 48 per cent. Irish Life & Permanent was 
down 46 per cent, while AIB ended the week 43 per cent below the price at which it started it.
Anglo, for so long the stellar performer of the Irish stock exchange, also became the first Irish bank to fall more than 
90 per cent peak-to-trough last week, when it bottomed out at  1.61 - 91 per cent off the all-time high of  17.85 it had 
recorded early last year - before staging a minor rebound as the week came to an end.
For investors in other Irish banks, the news has not been much better. Bank of Ireland was, at one point last week, 
89 per cent off its peak, while Irish Life & Permanent was 88 per cent off, and AIB was down 84 per cent.
The broader Iseq index, by comparison, finished the week down a more respectable, but still barely believable, 27 
per cent. The Iseq has fallen 79 per cent since it peaked by briefly touching 10,000 a little over 18 months ago. It is 
likely to be a long time before investors see that level again.
The collapse in banking stocks has transformed the make-up of the index, with the four quoted Irish banks now 
accounting for just 27 per cent of the total index, down from 40 per cent earlier this year and around 50 per cent 
when the banks were flying at their highest.
By contrast, building materials group CRH, now the biggest quoted Irish company by a considerable distance, 
makes up 22 per cent of the index, while Ryanair is now a bigger component of the index than Bank of Ireland, the 
country's second-largest bank.
Banks feel the noose tightening
What may worry bank shareholders even more, however, is the speed at which stock prices have returned to earth, 
even after news that, in normal circumstances, would have triggered a strong and lasting rally.
It is a measure of the ongoing downward pressure on bank share prices that the emergency 0.5 per cent rate cut 
announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the world's other major central banks on Wednesday only 
provided a remarkably short-lived feel-good factor.
Bank share prices rallied by up to 25 per cent in the minutes after the coordinated central bank intervention. 
However, analysts and investors were left reeling when these gains were wiped out within the hour.
Previous ECB rate cuts have sparked rallies that have lasted for days or even weeks, as investors factored in the 
likely benefits to banks of increased borrowing power and an opportunity to widen lending margins. But these 
potential benefits, coupled with signals that even more rate cuts may be coming down the line in the weeks and 
months ahead, failed to register last week.
Davy analyst Scott Rankin said the rate cuts, while welcome, would do little on their own to make life easier for 
Ireland's mortgage lenders.
''From the point of view of the mortgage banks, what matters most is the gap between interbank funding costs and 
the base rate. This gap at the three-month level was 112bps in Europe before the ECB's announcement."
Despite the cut in the ECB rate, however, the three-month interbank Euribor borrowing rate moved in the opposite 
direction, sending the spread between Euribor and the ECB rate to a once-unthinkable 1.6 per cent - almost 10 
times the spread that was typical before the credit crunch.
As all of Ireland's mortgage lenders agreed to pass on the 0.5 per cent ECB rate cut to tracker mortgage and 
Standard Variable Rate (SVR) customers, however, the profitability of these loans looked set to deteriorate further.
This was because the gap between what banks were receiving from customers and paying in the markets to fund 
the loans continued to widen.
''What needs to happen to get this down significantly is some form of government support for unsecured inter-bank 
lending'', said Rankin.
Shareholders, however, were left to wonder whether any measure could arrest the slide, considering that the value 
of their banks continued to dwindle even after the Irish government had committed to underwrite the sector's 
liabilities to the tune of  500 billion, coupled with a shock rate cut that was double the size of even the most 
optimistic of forecasts.
At the prices on offer last week, even hardened bargain hunters were reluctant to gamble on a recovery in the 
sector, as the perceived risks of consolidation grew bigger and the threat of a bank being acquired on unfavourable 
terms weighed heavily.
Investors also fretted at the prospect of rights issues, as the British government's intervention to recapitalise its 
banking sector offered an unwelcome reminder that Ireland's banks were perceived as equally likely to seek out 
fresh cash injections - with or without government support.
But it was shareholders with the longest memories who were able to quantify just how far the Irish banks had fallen 
out of favour. AIB and Bank of Ireland's share prices fell last week to levels not seen since 1996 and 1995, 
respectively, meaning that hard-won gains built up over 11 or 12 years had been wiped out in the space of 18 
months.
Until last month, these shareholders could at least console themselves that their banks paid out strong dividends 
and that this income stream would continue to ease the pain. Even this appeared to have been stripped away by 
last week, as speculation mounted that the government would impose a dividend ban in return for its support to 
force a hurried rebuilding of each bank's capital base. The market may even be running out of dead cats.

Mannion takes aim at Aer Lingus 's costs
Mannion takes aim at Aer Lingus's costs

Last week, Aer Lingus set the clock ticking on its most radical overhaul since the days of Willie Walsh.
Dermot Mannion, Walsh's replacement as chief executive, initiated plans to cut staff numbers by up to 1,500, in a 
move that aims to knock  74 million off the former state airline's annual costs.
While Mannion has little choice but to proceed with the plan, thanks to a twin squeeze from high fuel bills and 
faltering passenger demand, he faces a potentially tough struggle with unions.
Mannion's argument, that the cost-cutting plan is unavoidable, has been dented by recent signs that oil prices may 
be on the way to settling at more palatable levels. He is also attempting a bold move to make staff redundant 
against a backdrop of rising unemployment, which makes it less likely that staff will agree to leave, added to their 
knowledge that the airline is sitting on a cash pile of around  800 million.
Such a healthy cash balance is an easy target for unions arguing against the need for radical surgery, but 
Mannion's credibility would suffer if he began to use this money, most of which has been ringfenced for the 
purchase of new aircraft to subsidise losses.
The airline recently reported losses of  22 million for the six months to June, but Mannion has warned that full-year 
losses could hit  100 million next year, in the absence of action on costs.
Last week's move suggested Mannion had learned the lessons of his previous cost-cutting plan, which was 
instigated as part of the airline's defence against the Ryanair takeover, but which took over a year to implement and 
only delivered cost savings of  20 million.
Mannion set a deadline of the end of next month for the commencement of the new programme, with key initiatives 
- such as staff departures and contracting to external suppliers of tasks currently carried out by staff on the Aer 
Lingus payroll - due to kick in with a vengeance by early next year.
Mannion takes aim at Aer Lingus 's costs
For staff who remain with the airline, Mannion will aim to end the civil service-style practice of granting pay 
increases based on length of service, rather than quality of service.
After more than two years at the helm, Mannion appears to have decided that now is the best time to complete the 
transformation of the airline, from a culture of semi-state sluggishness to the uncomfortable, but more efficient world 
inhabited by publicly-quoted companies.
If he succeeds, shareholders may be shielded from the worst effects of an increasingly worrying economic 
slowdown and volatile oil prices. If he fails, however, the prospects of abandoning the airline to its fate may grow for 
both shareholders and Mannion himself.

Airport parking 'rip off'

I noted the attempts by the DAA's Vincent Wall (05/10/08) to avoid explaining the rip offs being perpetrated by the 
DAA monopoly on the travelling public and airlines at Dublin Airport. However, he failed to explain why the DAA's 
daily short-term car parking charge of  40 is among the most rapacious in the country and why this has doubled 
from  20 to  40 per day over the past two years (20 times the rate of inflation). Perhaps Vincent Wall would now 
answer these questions, rather than wasting time attacking Ryanair's fares and charges.
What he conveniently ignores is that every passenger has a choice as to whether they fly Ryanair or choose one of 
our higher fare competitors. Sadly, no passenger (or airline) has a choice over whether they use the high cost, 
consumer rip-off Dublin Airport monopoly.

Ryanair broadens its horizons as far as the US

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said his plans to invest in a start-up transatlantic long-haul airline could 
be expedited if there were a sharp fall in aircraft prices due to the crisis in the global aviation industry.
"The business plan is done . . . but it has been parked until there is a big downturn in the industry and Boeing and 
Airbus are parking long-haul aircraft, so we can get a deal on prices," he said.
A long-haul business would be run separately from Ryanair. Mr O'Leary said he would bring in other investors and 
that he had discussed the plan with shareholders including David Bonderman, Ryanair chairman and co-founder of 
TPG, the US private equity group, and with former executives of Southwest Airlines and Continental Airlines of the 
US. The venture would aim to operate from up to 10 existing Ryanair bases in Europe to a similar number of 
destinations in the US.
The airline would offer economy and business class services, as without the high fare revenues from premium 
services rivals such as British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM could "dump economy fares to zero ad 
infinitum" to try to drive it out of business.
Mr O'Leary raised his profit forecast for Ryanair in the current year to March 2009 from break-even to "between 
break-even and a small profit" given the fall in the oil price.
Ryanair was caught out by its failure to hedge its fuel requirements for much of the past year. It remains unhedged 
for its final quarter from January to March and for all of the next financial year and stands to benefit from the sharp 
drop in fuel prices.

The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down another 5pc in early trading today.
A short time ago the index was 170.30 points down at 3,128.81.
The fall was in line with big drops on exchanges around the world.
Even the FTSE 100 was down 3pc in London this morning, despite the announcement of a £50bn government cash 
boost for banks. In Dublin, the falls were for once not led by the banks. AIB was the only bank to show a significant 
fall, with a 35c drop to 520. Bank of Ireland was up by 1c to 330 and Anglo Irish made a similar gain to 270. Irish 
Life and Permanent was unchanged at 380. CRH, however, was down 25c to 1519, and Aer Lingus dropped 8c to

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday he may help create a sister company to launch a long-
haul, low-cost airline, if cheap aircraft became available next year.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, would not invest in the new airline but Ryanair shareholders including 
himself may be invited to participate, O'Leary said.
'If aircraft fleet prices collapse, it is a real possibility,' O'Leary told reporters in London.
'There may be the opportunity to buy a fleet of long-haul aircraft cheaply next year,' he said, adding that a collapse 
of a carrier may create the opportunity for such an order, which would then take a further 18 months to deliver.
Dozen of airlines have gone bankrupt worldwide, hit by a combination of high oil prices and faltering economies, but 
analysts see Dublin-based Ryanair's position strong as its costs are lower and cash reserves higher than most 
peers.
O'Leary said there would be no direct connection between the two airlines except that the long-haul one may want 
to use Ryanair's European bases as hubs.
O'Leary has said in the past he was looking into plans for a no-frills transatlantic airline, without providing any 
details.
He reiterated that Ryanair expected to break even for the current year if oil stayed at $100 per barrel and yields, or 
average ticket prices, fell by 5 percent.
Ryanair remained unhedged for its fuel needs for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, O'Leary said.

EasyJet increased September passenger volumes 22 per cent to 4.2m in a further indication of the rising market 
share being gained by the leading low-cost carriers in the short-haul market in Europe, writes Kevin Done.
Ireland's Ryanair, the biggest European no-frills operator, said last Friday it had handled 20 per cent more 
passengers year-on-year last month at 5.2m. In the past 12 months Ryanair carried 56m passengers compared 
with 43.7m at EasyJet.
Ryanair has been discounting its fares heavily in order to stimulate traffic in the face of weakening economies and 
declining consumer confidence.
The two airlines are also gaining from the retrenchment of the tour operators and their associated charter airlines. 
XL Leisure, the third-largest UK tour operator, collapsed into bankruptcy last month and other big tour operators 
have sharply reduced capacity.
British Airways underlined last week the scale of the challenge facing the airline sector when it announced a 4.8 per 
cent fall in its traffic volumes, measured by revenue passenger kilometres, in September.

Groups have learnt lessons from the failure of DayJet, writes Kevin Done
Body
The race is on in Europe to test out new business models for low-cost private jet travel.
Undaunted by the difficulties that have recently beset similar ventures in the US, two start-up groups, Blink of the 
UK and Ireland's JetBird, are setting out to make private jet use more affordable offering prices up to 50 per cent 
below those of current operators.
They aim to bring lessons from commercial low-cost carriers, such as Ryanair and EasyJet, into the more rarefied 
corporate jet world, and to exploit a new breed of very light four-passenger jets that are entering the market, Blink 
with the Cessna Mustang and JetBird with the Embraer Phenom 100.
They have already placed orders and options for nearly 150 aircraft for delivery by the end of 2013 from the US and 
Brazilian planemakers.
Blink has been the first out of the blocks.
Peter Leiman, one of the co-founders and a former UBS investment banker, dismissed concerns about falling 
demand from weakening economies in Europe and fears raised by the recent collapse of DayJet, the hugely 
ambitious air-taxi start-up in the US.
DayJet ceased operations two weeks ago after barely a year of flying and after failing to secure critical refinancing. 
It was the world's first "per-seat, on-demand" private jet service.
It had already taken 28 Eclipse 500 very light jets - most are now parked - and had been planning to take delivery of 
300 in the first two years, with the total set to rise to as many as 1,400 in five years.
Blink and JetBird aim to slash cost of private jet travel in Europe
Mr Leiman said Blink, now in its fifth month of operation, had avoided the complexity of DayJet, which had invested 
heavily in the development of proprietary software systems. It was selling whole aircraft rather than individual seats 
like DayJet. It had also chosen to buy its planes from Cessna, a long-established jet maker, rather than buying from 
an unproven start-up venture such as Eclipse.
Blink has been founded by Mr Leiman, formerly of UBS, and Cameron Ogden, son of British IT entrepreneur Sir 
Peter Ogden, who was at Goldman Sachs.
Blink raised $30m in equity last December from three private family funds. By mid-November the fleet will have 
grown to four and the plan is to expand to 45 jets by 2012.
Four former British Airways executives have been recruited to lead the operations management.
Blink had flown its first aircraft for 70 hours last month, said Mr Leiman. "It's too early to draw any definitive 
conclusions, but the costs were in line and revenues and utilisation were above the plan," he said. "We will know a 
lot more about this business once we have the next few aircraft in service."
In its best performance to date, it had flown one 11-hour day, with eight separate flights between five countries and 
six cities, with three different customer groups and a change of crew.
JetBird is following fast in the wake of Blink.
Last month it secured EUR10m (£7.78m) in additional equity capital from a Middle East strategic investor, which 
has taken a stake of 9.3 per cent alongside Domhnal Slattery, the Irish financier and founder. The group raised 
EUR21m in December last year through a share placement led by Mr Slattery's Claret Capital, the Dublin-based 
private investment firm.
JetBird is aiming to build a private jet airline and will be the launch customer in Europe for the Embraer Phenom 
100. The plane, still undergoing flight tests, is due to be certified and to enter service in the US before the end of the 
year.
JetBird should take its first delivery in April next year and is due to receive 15 by the end of December 2009. It 
placed a firm order in 2006 for 50, with options for another 50. It is planning to have a fleet of 100 by the end of 
2013.
Mr Slattery said JetBird was aiming to offer private jet services on a "contained network" between 75 European 
airports and eventually intended to have five main operating bases most probably at Cologne/Bonn, London 
Stansted, Paris Le Bourget, Milan and Basel airports. The service will launch first in Germany. It is aiming to begin 
commercial service in June or July next year.
Mr Slattery, former managing director of the structured asset finance business of Royal Bank of Scotland, said the 
group would offer private jet premium service at a much lower price, comparable to business-class travel and 
costing less than 50 per cent of some existing branded private jet services.

The threat to reputation is a crucial issue, writes Fiona Harvey
Body
Ryanair shareholders attending the company's general meeting in Dublin in September were bemused by a sight 
not often associated with such gatherings, when a bare-chested young man wearing an oxygen mask approached 
the podium where Michael O'Leary, the chief executive, was speaking.
The protestor, with "Exposing O'Leary's Lies" written across his chest, accused the airline chief of denying the 
damage his fleet was causing to the climate. His protest underlined the pressure aviation companies are under from 
the green movement.
All air travel accounts for only a few per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions, but its projected expansion means 
it will become a much bigger source of emissions within 20 years.
Flying also produces much more carbon dioxide than some other forms of transport.
The rising number of short-haul flights to destinations that could be served by railways, which produce less carbon 
per passenger, has been a complaint of environmentalists.
Campaigners say airlines have had unfair tax breaks on fuel that have skewed the economics of travel. Will 
corporate aviation be the next target for protests?
Joshua Blackburn, head of the ethical communications agency Provokateur, says it is unlikely that protestors will 
home in on corporate jets and business travel soon, as they are targeting the industry as a whole rather than 
niches.
But he warns that corporate travellers must become more aware of their impact, especially those using company or 
business hire jets.
"Using corporate jets puts you at the front of the queue as far as your carbon footprint is concerned. There isn't 
much else that would make your footprint bigger."
Green issues move up the balance sheet
He predicts that such trips will become "socially unacceptable" and that environmental groups will target companies 
that claim to be "green" but continue using "this form of corporate indulgence".
The corporate aviation sector is becoming increasingly aware of the threat to its reputation of failing to deal with 
climate change.
Mr O'Leary called his lone protestor an "eco-looney", but other parts of the industry have taken a more conciliatory 
approach, seeking to reduce the impact of their flights.
For instance, Boeing has worked with seven airlines in the past year - including British Airways, Air France KLM, 
Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines and El Al - on a "performance improvement package" of fuelefficiency 
technologies that save 1,300 tonnes of carbon dioxide per aircraft per year.
There is an economic advantage, too. Per Noren, vicepresident of environmental strategy at Boeing's commercial 
aviation services division, says: "Operational efficiencies become environmental efficiencies and the aviation 
community can contribute to a cleaner future."
But voluntary measures are only part of the picture. Regulation is also increasing, in Europe at least.
Airlines will be covered by the European Union's emissions trading scheme from 2012. They will be allocated a 
fixed quota of carbon emissions, and must buy carbon permits from other groups if they need to emit more.
This will impose large costs. Robert Casamento, a director in the power and utilities team at Ernst & Young, says: 
"Airlines incur very high carbon abatement costs compared with other industrial sectors.
"In addition, many expected technological improvements, such as fuel- efficient engine designs and lighter-weight 
components, will not be in place in time to achieve significant emission reductions before 2022."
A report last year by Ernst & Young predicted that the cost to the European aviation industry of purchasing the 
emissions allowances needed for traffic growth could exceed EUR45bn in the period from 2012 to 2022.
Mr Casamento says this could have the effect of "jeopardising the long-term viability of many airlines and increasing 
the need for further consolidation. Some European airlines are already beginning to develop carbon-hedging 
programs."
The costs will translate directly into higher ticket prices for all travellers.
One aspect of the regulations that is still unclear is the treatment of private and corporate jets. One proposal would 
exempt such flights from the scheme, provided "carbon offsets" are bought to cover the emissions.
Offset schemes allow travellers to cancel out the effect of their emissions by buying carbon credits, which fund 
carboncutting schemes, such as wind turbines or solar panels, usually in developing countries. They are already 
used by many corporate travellers and several charter and fractional schemes.
A separate proposal would exempt companies making fewer than 245 flights in four months.
But if corporate and private jets are included, it would "impose a serious administrative burden", says Mark Bissett, 
partner at Stephenson Harwood, a law firm.
Companies would pay a financial penalty in having to buy emissions permits, but more costly would be ensuring 
compliance with the scheme through monitoring emissions and having them independently verified.
At least, however, companies could deflect the wrath of environmentalists by pointing to their compliance with the 
emissions trading scheme.

Ryanair has welcomed a court decision in Germany to back the Irish airline's refusal to compensate a passenger 
after a flight was cancelled due to weather.
The German court found that bad weather prevented Ryanair from landing safely and represented extraordinary 
circumstances which were beyond the control of the airline under EU261 regulations.
The passenger, who was seeking compensation of over E1,600 as a result of this forced cancellation, had his claim 
dismissed by Simmern Court. The passenger must now settle all costs associated with the case, including 
Ryanair's costs.
Welcoming the finding, Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "The decision of the court was in accordance with the 
provisions of EU261. We understand that cancelled flights can be frustrating. However, we must always make 
decisions which prioritise the safety of our passengers, crew and aircraft."

Charges at Dublin Airport
Charges at Dublin Airport

Hopefully, we can attribute Stephen McNamara's (28/9/2008) lack of understanding of how the regulatory system 
works at Dublin Airport to his relatively short period of time working for Ryanair. Otherwise, it would be depressing 
indeed that, after just four months with his new employers, he has acquired their semi-detached attitude to facts.
For the record, all commercial revenues generated by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) at Dublin Airport are offset 
by the Commission for Aviation Regulation against the airport charges that passengers pay for aviation services at 
the airport. In other words, the income DAA generates from some passengers, for using its car parking, shopping 
and catering services, is used to subsidise the airport charges paid by all passengers for aviation services. As a 
result, those airport charges are the lowest of any major international airport in Europe.
It is also perhaps worth pointing out that DAA only charges customers for services that it actually provides or 
recovers costs that it actually incurs. The same cannot be said for Ryanair.
Take, for instance, the airline's flights from Cork Airport to Prestwick and East Midlands in Britain. Intending 
passengers who booked flights on either of these routes on Ryanair's website last week would have been charged  
18.13 for so-called ''taxes and fees'', on the outbound leg of the journey.
This money goes straight to Ryanair's bottom line, as there are no government taxes in Ireland on air travel. 
Ryanair has enjoyed 100 per cent discounts on standard airport fees for these routes since they were launched 
from Cork, late last year.
Customers are also charged  5 per head per journey for credit or debit card bookings on the Ryanair website. This 
means that an intending passenger, booking a return flight by credit card to Britain for a group of four people, will 
pay a credit card fee of  40 for that transaction. The Ryanair website refers to this credit card administration 
payment as a ''small charge."
Charges at Dublin Airport
Perhaps McNamara could also inform Sunday Business Post readers just how much Ryanair was paid in its latest 
financial year in fares, taxes, fees and charges, insurance, wheelchair levies and aviation insurance, by customers 
who subsequently did not fly with the airline.
Millions of euro by our reckoning, but it would be great to get the specific figure from Ryanair. Until Ryanair ceases 
charging its customers for services it does not provide, or costs it does not incur, it has no credibility in commenting 
on the commercial activities of other organisations.

Rescue bid for Alitalia gets wings

An Italian solution to an Italian problem may yet pull the insolvent state-owned airline, Alitalia, back from the brink.
An all-Italian investor company, Compagnia Aerea Italiana (CAI), has bid to acquire assets including flight 
operations.
Loss-making activities, such as cargo, will be sold to help pay the bankrupt national carrier's substantial debts. A 
foreign airline, probably Lufthansa or Air France, may take a sizeable, but not a majority, stake in the consortium.
Aergo Capital, an aircraft leasing company in which Irish businessman Denis O'Brien is a shareholder, leases 
planes to Alitalia. ''The situation is being monitored," a spokesman for O'Brien said.
At one point, Aergo was reported to have over half its fleet leased to Alitalia through a subsidiary. However, it is 
understood to have made a number of acquisitions since then, so planes leased to the Italian company would now 
represent a smaller percentage of its fleet.
The CAI consortium is led by the chairman of iconic Vespa scooter-making firm Piaggio, Roberto Colaninno, who 
last week coolly claimed he was in ''no rush'' to find a foreign partner.
Other heavyweight members of CAI include president of the Pirelli tyre empire Marco Provera Tronchetti, as well as 
the Benetton family, through Atlantia SpA, the road-tolling firm it controls. The company which runs Italy's biggest 
private carrier, Air One, is also involved.
After tortuous negotiations, the CAI last week finally secured support for its rescue plan from Alitalia's powerful 
unions. More than 3,000 jobs will go, but concessions to win union backing reportedly cost the consortium  2.8 
million.
Either Lufthansa or the Air France-KLM group is expected to come on board, with Italian prime minister Silvio 
Berlusconi openly voicing a preference for the German airline.
Rescue bid for Alitalia gets wings
Unlike Air France, Lufthansa would probably prioritise Malpensa airport in Milan above Rome's Fiumicino. This 
would please Berlusconi's influential government partners in the Northern League.
However, labour minister Maurizio Sacconi has claimed that Air France-KLM and Lufthansa are currently ''on the 
same level''.
Lufthansa would also be the airline of choice for the Alitalia unions. Air France's proposed takeover fell through in 
April. At that time, the unions' position was described as incompatible with the Franco-Dutch company's offer to buy 
Alitalia for 10 cent a share.
Alitalia filed for bankruptcy in August, and Italy's bankruptcy laws are being modified to allow the company's flight 
operations to be sold off separately.
Cargo, maintenance and other loss-making activities will be sold or liquidated to help cover debts of over  1 billion. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair has protested to the European Commission about CAI's rescue plan.
Ryanair's legal director, Jim Callaghan, claimed the Italian government had guaranteed the investments of the 
consortium members and had underwritten concessions to the unions in exchange for their agreement to what he 
described as a ''ridiculous plan''.
Ryanair had previously complained about a government-backed loan for Alitalia, as had the European Tour 
Operators Association, British Airways and other airlines.

Europe's largest low fare airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. said passenger traffic rose 20 percent in September while 
load factor fell one percentage point compared to figures for the same month last year.
Passenger traffic increased to 5.23 million from 4.35 million while load factor fell to 84 percent from 85 percent the 
same month last year.
'A lot of price sensitive leisure passengers have switched from rival, high fares airlines, to Ryanair. However, in light 
of the current crisis in banking and financial institutions we are confident that we will soon seen more bankers 
migrate to Ryanair also,' Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said in a statement.

Ireland's low-fare airline Ryanair filed a complaint Thursday with the European Union over Italy's rescue deal for the 
national carrier Alitalia.
Ryanair said the bailout amounted to illegal protection of failed companies by national governments, something that 
the 27-nation EU tries to outlaw.
"This is the latest and perhaps most blatant example of the Italian government doing whatever it takes to protect 
their failed airline," said Ryanair director Jim Callaghan. Under the deal drafted by investors, the government is 
selling its 49.9 percent stake in the company.
The EU Commission said the complaint from Ryanair will be addressed as any other it receives.
Ryanair claimed the EU Commission had already failed to enforce EU state aid rules in cases concerning Olympic, 
Air France and Lufthansa airlines.
Italian investors have pledged to inject 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) into the money-losing carrier, strip away 
unprofitable assets and combine it with Italy's second-largest carrier, the much smaller Air One.
They also are looking for an international carrier, possibly Air France-KLM or Lufthansa, to take a minority share.
Ryanair threatened to take the case to the European courts if the EU Commission backs the deal.

Earlier this week unions agreed to back a deal with Italian consortium CAI, which briefly withdrew its offer over 
labour opposition.
'The Italian government is writing off up to 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in Alitalia debts and is guaranteeing the 
investments by the members of the consortium and underwriting huge concessions to the unions in exchange for 
their agreement to these ludicrous plans,' said Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's director of legal and regulatory affairs in a

After its future seemed in doubt, administrators acting for Alitalia announced a number of expressions of interest in 
the group's operations.â€‚A proposal from a consortium of Italian investors is back on track after trade unions 
swung their weight behind it.â€‚A number of other expressions were received for other companies in the group, 
including the ground transportation and maintenance operations.â€‚Ryanair launched a legal challenge to the deal 
to save Alitalia.â€‚It has submitted a formal complaint to the European Commission against the "latest unlawful 
bailout of the failed Italian national carrier". Ryanair has previously launched complaints against similar rescue bids 
for flag carriers.â€‚
Virgin Blue has announced a delay to the launch of its long-haul international carrier V Australia, blaming the 
machinists' strike at Boeing.â€‚The launch had been planned for December 15, but has been pushed back to at 
least February 28 next year.â€‚Virgin Blue took the decision after Boeing advised its customers that it was unable to 
predict the duration of the strike, and could not guarantee delivery dates.â€‚Ryanair announced the cancellation of 
flights onâ€‚dozens ofâ€‚routes because of the strike.â€‚The cancellations concern Birmingham in the UK, and 
Düsseldorf (Weeze) in Germany. Ryanair had already delayed the opening of its new Reus base, and the delivery 
of a new aircraft to Bergamo, because of the dispute.â€‚
AIG has sold its 50% stake in London City Airport to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), as it begins the process of 
selling off assets to repay the $85 billion rescue loan from the US government. GIP's purchase means the 
investment firm has 100% control of the airport. The deal, which will close in November, is for an estimated £250 
million ($444 million). The disposal of AIG's stake in the airport is to be followed by a raft of further asset sales, 
including aircraft leasing company ILFC.
DVB Bank has completed its restructuring from a public limited company under German law into a European public 
limited company. The new legal form will allow the bank's European staff to assume a more active role in co-
determination, and on the supervisory board. The bank hopes the new form will lead to a simpler structure of the 
DVB Group.
Capital Lease Aviation has released its full-year results for the year ended June 30. The Aim-quoted company

Airbus officially opened its A320 assembly line in Tianjin, China. The assembly line is a joint venture between the 
European manufacturer and a Chinese consortium comprising Tianjin Free Trade Zone and China Aviation Industry 
Corporation.
The UK government wants the aviation sector exempted from an EU target that aims to derive 20% of Europe's 
energy needs from renewable sources by 2020. According to the Department for Business, Enterprise and 
Regulatory Reform, uncertainty over the use of biofuels makes the inclusion of aviation in the general EU target 
pointless. Although aviation is legally bound to the target, it is possible that the sector could be excluded, with other 
parts of the economy ensuring that the overall 20% target is met.
Airbus chief executive Tom Enders has said that Airbus and Boeing's duopoly of the global aviation industry is set 
to end, as China and Russia develop a capacity to manufacture large commercial jets. Enders, who was speaking 
on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, said he looked forward both to cooperating with and competing 
against the two nations.
National Aviation Company of India is looking to raise $1.15 billion in loans to buy 21 Airbus aircraft. An appeal 
appeared on the company's website. Meanwhile, the country's Civil Aviation Ministry is reportedly due to meet the 
country's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, as it seeks a bail-out for Air India, which clocked up losses of more than 
Rs21 billion ($446 million)â€‚in the last financial year.
World Airways has signed a two-year contract with Allied Air to operate an MD-11F on a full-time basis between 
Belgium and Nigeria. World Airways, a wholly owned subsidiary of US company Global Aero Logistics,â€‚began 
operating the aircraft for Nigerian Allied Air on October 1.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has approved an application from Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines 
forâ€‚a single operating certificate.â€‚The application is a key step in the proposed merger between the two 
carriers, which will see the creation of a new company called Delta.â€‚The plan submitted by the two airlines sets 
out a timetable for achieving the certificate within 15 to 18 months.
Transaero has reported its results for the first eight months of 2008, with revenue passenger kilometres growing to 
11.761 billion, an increase of 58% from the same period last year. Passenger numbers also increased by 58%, 
growing to 3.318 million, and freight turnover showed a 57% increase.
On-demand US private jet operator DayJet has ceased services and cancelled all flights.â€‚DayJet started 
operationsâ€‚in October 2007,â€‚operating a per-seat, on-demand service within the southeast US, using Eclipse 
500 very light jets. DayJetâ€‚blamed economic conditions for its failure, stating that the "shutdown is a direct 
consequence of the company's inability to arrange critical financing in the midst of the current global financial 
crisis".â€‚ In May the company failed to secure $40 million in financing and scaled back its growth plans for the 
remainder of the year. n
* Alaska Airlines has announced it will be cutting capacity by 8% and its workforce by 9% to 10%.â€‚This will result 
in 15% fewer departures, and 850 to 1,000 job losses.â€‚Alaska Group cited record oil prices and a softening 
economy for the decision. Horizon Air, part of the Alaska Group, will reduce capacity in the fourth quarter by 20% 
compared with last year, leading to a reduction of 9% overall for 2008.â€‚It will cut 75 management and 94 pilot 
positions, with a further 40 pilots on leave in November.
* A new EU emissions trading scheme, which will make European airlines pay for their carbon emissions, will result 
in greater efficiency in an atmosphere of rising costs, according to a report by Merrill Lynch. The scheme, likely to 
be approved later this year before coming into effect in 2012,â€‚will cost European airlines an estimated ?3 billion 
from 2015. The move is expected to drive demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft, increase the use ofâ€‚profitable 
routes and encourage airlines to hedge their fuel. But, says the report, it will also result in a 3% increase in ticket 
prices as airlines pass on the additional cost.
* Serbian national carrier Jat Airways released a statement denyingâ€‚suggestions that it was on the verge of 
bankruptcy.â€‚The claims appeared in the Serbian daily, Press, and quoted Sasa Vlaisavljevic, president of Jat 
Ear to the ground
Airways, as saying that the airline was running out of money and could afford only to operate nine of its 15 
aircraft.â€‚The statement insisted that "the situation in the national airline is stable and that there are no signs of 
bankruptcy".â€‚
* International logistics company FedEx Corp has reported a 22% drop in quarterly netâ€‚income, down to $384 
million from $494 million.â€‚Operating income was down 23%, from $814 million to $630 million, while the 
company's operating margin was 6.3%, as opposed to 8.8% last year.â€‚Revenue was up 8%, from $9.2 billion to 
$9.97 billion. The company attributed the decline to "global economic weakness, higher fuel prices and the related 
negative effects of higher fuel surcharges".â€‚
* Qantas has received the first of 20 A380s it has on order. Qantas was the first customer to sign a contract for the 
A380, and is the second-largest customer for the aircraft. The airline will launch commercial A380 services on 
October 20, serving the Melbourne to Los Angeles route, before extending this to the Sydney to Los Angeles route. 
The carrier has ordered Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines for the final eight A380s it has on order.â€‚The deal is 
valued at more than $575 million. All 20 of Qantas's A380s will be powered by Trent 900s.
* Bombardier has announced it is taking over full responsibility for structural development and manufacturing of the 
Learjet 85 business jet programme. The decision comes after the insolvency of partner Grob Aerospace, 
announced in August.â€‚The Canadian and German manufacturers were jointly developing the midsize business 
jet, with some operations sited at Grob's Tussenhausen-Mattsiesâ€‚facility in Germany.

* In a ruling that could alter the nature of airline privatizations, the European Commission said that Olympic Airlines 
must repay ?850 million ($1.2 million) of illegal state aid to the Greek government before it is privatized. The fine is 
part of a deal reached between the Greek government and the EC that will see Olympic liquidated and its assets 
transferred to new entity, Pantheon, before being privatized by the end of next year. Under the terms of the deal, 
Pantheon will inherit the Olympic name and five-ring logo and acquire 65% of the airline's capacity. Two further 
companies will acquire the maintenance assets. The agreement comes after a ruling by a European court in 
February that Greece failed to comply with an EC decision that government aid to Olympic was illegal and should 
be recovered.

After its future seemed in doubt, administrators acting for Alitalia announced a number of expressions of interest in 
the group's operations. A proposal from a consortium of Italian investors is back on track after trade unions swung 
their weight behind it. A number of other expressions were received for other companies in the group, including the 
ground transportation and maintenance operations. Ryanair launched a legal challenge to the deal to save Alitalia. 
It has submitted a formal complaint to the European Commission against the "latest unlawful bailout of the failed 
Italian national carrier". Ryanair has previously launched complaints against similar rescue bids for flag carriers. 
Virgin Blue has announced a delay to the launch of its long-haul international carrier V Australia, blaming the 
machinists' strike at Boeing. The launch had been planned for December 15, but has been pushed back to at least 
February 28 next year. Virgin Blue took the decision after Boeing advised its customers that it was unable to predict 
the duration of the strike, and could not guarantee delivery dates. Ryanair announced the cancellation of flights on 
dozens of routes because of the strike. The cancellations concern Birmingham in the UK, and Düsseldorf (Weeze) 
in Germany. Ryanair had already delayed the opening of its new Reus base, and the delivery of a new aircraft to 
Bergamo, because of the dispute. 
AIG has sold its 50% stake in London City Airport to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), as it begins the process of 
selling off assets to repay the $85 billion rescue loan from the US government. GIP's purchase means the 
investment firm has 100% control of the airport. The deal, which will close in November, is for an estimated £250 
million ($444 million). The disposal of AIG's stake in the airport is to be followed by a raft of further asset sales, 
including aircraft leasing company ILFC.
DVB Bank has completed its restructuring from a public limited company under German law into a European public 
limited company. The new legal form will allow the bank's European staff to assume a more active role in co-
determination, and on the supervisory board. The bank hopes the new form will lead to a simpler structure of the 
DVB Group.
Capital Lease Aviation has released its full-year results for the year ended June 30. The Aim-quoted company 
reported revenues from aircraft rental of about £1.75 million ($3.13 million), achieved mainly in the fourth quarter. 
Annualized base rental revenues for aircraft on hand as at June 30 increased to £7.45 million. Group net post-tax

The Dublin market rebounded by over 7pc today thanks to an unprecedented intervention by the Irish Government 
to shore up confidence in Irish financials.
At the close, the ISEQ was up 259.11 points to 3,550.63.
While the gains on the ISEQ were impressive, the index still only recouped just over half of its losses from Monday 
when it crashed by nearly 500 points or 13pc amid historic turmoil on the global markets.
The intervention of the Finance Minister, Brian Lenehan - which came as the US gave its shocking rejection of the 
USD700 billion rescue plan - saved Irish banking shares from potential collapse. The guarantee to deposits and 
debt at Irish banks amounts to a staggering E456 billion, analysts have revealed. The guarantee dwarfs Irish GDP - 
worth around E190 billion - and Ireland's national debt - worth around E45 billion. Ireland may well be seen as the 
safe haven for beleaguered European cash and investments after the Government's intervention with, potentially a 
tsunami wave of cash flowing in to Irish bank coffers, according to market traders. 'Basically Irish banks are safe for 
the next two years,' one Dublin trader said. 'We view the development as a positive as it should stabilise funding for 
the Irish banks, however issues for the real economy still remain,' according to Dolmen Stockbrokers. Scott Rankin 
of Davy Research said the government initiative represents the State 'taking out its bazooka'. He believes that it 
exposes the Irish Government to E500 billion. But the underlying problem has not gone away - indeed, following the 
rejection of the Washington bailout, it has actually become worse, all analysts agree. Scott Rankin called the 
Congress rejection 'crazy' while the EU's Peter Mandelson said US lawmakers 'have lost their senses'. 'Latest 
reports suggest another vote as soon as tomorrow (October 1st), when we would expect a deal to be done without 
significant dilution of the draft agreement. But for the imperilled global financial system, a gap of two days is 
worryingly long,' Mr Rankin said. He warned that 'now that the seal has been broken' Europe's banks can expect 
more rescues. Shares in UK bank, HBOS, plunged by 20pc at one stage yesterday on the FTSE 100 as speculation

E2.26. 'With the bubble beginning to bust on commodities, this clearly will be a huge benefit to airlines, particularly 
those which are unhedged and have hedged the dollar. In all the turmoil of the macro environment, we think ex-fuel 
costs will come to the fore,' said Davy's Stephen Furlong. Aer Lingus shares dropped 3c to E1.42.

The Dublin market rebounded by over 7pc today thanks to an unprecedented intervention by the Irish Government 
to shore up confidence in Irish financials.
At the close, the ISEQ was up 259.11 points to 3,550.63.
While the gains on the ISEQ were impressive, the index still only recouped just over half of its losses from Monday 
when it crashed by nearly 500 points or 13pc amid historic turmoil on the global markets.
The intervention of the Finance Minister, Brian Lenehan - which came as the US gave its shocking rejection of the 
USD700 billion rescue plan - saved Irish banking shares from potential collapse. The guarantee to deposits and 
debt at Irish banks amounts to a staggering E456 billion, analysts have revealed. The guarantee dwarfs Irish GDP - 
worth around E190 billion - and Ireland's national debt - worth around E45 billion. Ireland may well be seen as the 
safe haven for beleaguered European cash and investments after the Government's intervention with, potentially a 
tsunami wave of cash flowing in to Irish bank coffers, according to market traders. 'Basically Irish banks are safe for 
the next two years,' one Dublin trader said. 'We view the development as a positive as it should stabilise funding for 
the Irish banks, however issues for the real economy still remain,' according to Dolmen Stockbrokers. Scott Rankin 
of Davy Research said the government initiative represents the State 'taking out its bazooka'. He believes that it 
exposes the Irish Government to E500 billion. But the underlying problem has not gone away - indeed, following the 
rejection of the Washington bailout, it has actually become worse, all analysts agree. Scott Rankin called the 
Congress rejection 'crazy' while the EU's Peter Mandelson said US lawmakers 'have lost their senses'. 'Latest 
reports suggest another vote as soon as tomorrow (October 1st), when we would expect a deal to be done without 
significant dilution of the draft agreement. But for the imperilled global financial system, a gap of two days is 
worryingly long,' Mr Rankin said. He warned that 'now that the seal has been broken' Europe's banks can expect 
more rescues. Shares in UK bank, HBOS, plunged by 20pc at one stage yesterday on the FTSE 100 as speculation

gathered pace that the Lloyds TSB rescue deal may be coming apart. Irish bank shares surged with AIB up 18pc or

Ryanair pilots set for unpaid winter leave
Union fears move will 'casualise' working relationship
Ryanair will make unpaid leave this winter compulsory for its pilots if not enough of them volunteer for it, says the 
airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary.
The Irish low-fare airline's boss says periods of unpaid leave, which may vary from a week to three weeks, will be 
across the pilot workforce without reference to seniority. "If they don't like it they can leave," he adds.
The Irish Airline Pilots Association (IALPA) says this is a ploy to introduce a pay cut, but says it is most worried 
about the "casualisation" of the working relationship between the airline and its pilots: "Such casualisation is totally 
inappropriate to a safety critical technical profession such as that of airline pilots and IALPA is completely opposed 
to it."
If O'Leary can casualise leave arrangements at will, IALPA says, the question is where Ryanair will go next, 
because such actions imply the airline could move to a system under which it pays pilots only when it suits the 
carrier. On the issue of compulsory leave as a means of cutting pay, Capt Michael McLaughlin of IALPA says: "One 
week's compulsory unpaid leave is a 2% pay cut and four weeks is an 8% pay cut."
Ryanair is paring back on less profitable routes this winter and parking 20 737s. O'Leary says other cost-saving 
opportunities are being sought. He has taken a pay cut, and says others should share in the economic realities the 
airline faces.
Asked why he does not lay pilots off if he has too many, O'Leary says he has stopped recruiting as the carrier's 
needs are already taken care of well into next year, but adds that because the airline intends to continue expanding 
into the 2009 high season, layoffs do not make sense.
INTRODUCTION:
O'Leary says there are plenty of pilots available with airlines such as the UK's XL Airways closing. He expects more 
failures and wants Ryanair to be around to expand into the spaces left.

AILING CARRIERS Ryanair has ruled out snapping up any ailing carriers that fall victim to the current economic 
crisis as a way of boosting its European operations. "They don't have any assets, they don't own any aircraft, and 
they're structurally incorrectly set up," says deputy chief executive Howard Millar. As a result they are of no interest 
to the Irish carrier and are "probably doomed at this stage", adds Millar: "Market forces will take care of them."

It was disappointing, though not unexpected, to see a letter from the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) spin doctor 
(14/9/08) attempting to excuse the unjustified car parking rip-off being run by the DAA monopoly at Dublin Airport.
May we respond to the DAA's fiction with the facts:
* The DAA's short-term car parking charge is currently  40 per day, which is among the most rapacious and 
unjustified car parking rates in the country.
* This charge has doubled over the past two years, at a time when inflation is less than 5 per cent.
* The aviation regulator has no control over, or input into, these car parking charges, which are not regulated.
* The DAA's rapacious parking rates make no contribution towards Dublin Airport's high passenger charges, which 
have escalated at many times the rate of inflation each year for the past three years.
* These car parking charges make no contribution towards the DAA's gold-plated investment programme, which will 
be paid for through massively increased passenger charges when Terminal 2 and its other gold-plated facilities 
come online in two years' time.
* Vincent Wall's claim, that two-thirds of DAA's short-term car parking customers park there for less than an hour, is 
simply not accurate. The vast majority of the DAA's short-term car park customers are paying the full  40 daily rate, 
as they are held to ransom by this uncompetitive, government-owned airport monopoly.
Sadly, the aviation regulator has proven to be useless in protecting consumers from this government monopoly, 
which is why Kathleen Barrington was absolutely right with her complaints. This rip-off of the travelling public will 
continue until there are competing terminals (and car parks) at Dublin Airport.

The city: Amsterdam, the capital and largest city in the Netherlands.
What to see in a weekend: the best way to see Amsterdam is by bike. Cycling up and down the canals, pausing to 
take pictures of the pretty chocolate box cover houses before stopping for lunch at an outdoor canal-bank cafe is 
not a bad way to spend the morning. Be sure to see the city's oldest building (1425), Het Houten Huys (the Wooden 
House) on the Begijnhof.
For a different view of the city, take one of the many canal boat trips. Spend the next day filling up on some culture - 
the impressive Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh museum and Anne Frank's House should be your first ports of call.
After dinner, take a trip into one of the infamous coffee shops. It's worth paying a visit to at least one coffee shop, 
where the atmosphere is laid back and welcoming. If you don't fancy sampling the wares, just have a coffee and 
enjoy the atmosphere. Try not to breath too deeply.
Don't miss: Rembrandt's Nightwatch at the Rijksmuseum and the Heineken brewery. Do miss: De Wallen - the red-
light district. There is something seedy and embarrassing about staring at the working girls like they are tourist 
attractions. The local drug pushers are also, well, pushy there.
Where to eat: seafood is popular and there are lots of good places along the canals. You don't have to wander far 
before coming across typical Dutch snack bars where the locals eat chips with mayonnaise and wash it down with 
some Dutch beer. With brands like Heineken, Amstel, Grolsch, Oranjebook and Skol to choose from, it's best to go 
local.
Another Dutch speciality is the pancake-restaurant, called a 'pannenkoekhuis'. There are also many herring stands 
dotted around the city - where locals hold the fresh green herrings by the tail and slip them down their throats. For 
the brave.
Cycling is a Dutch treat
Shop like a local: De Negen Straatjes - literally translated as the Nine Little Streets - has lots of little boutiques, 
vintage shops, cafes and bars in wonderful old buildings. For more mainstream high-street stores, head to the 
Kalverstraat.
This pedestrianised area is always jam-packed full of shoppers and has a great buzz. If it is designer shopping you 
are after, Pieter Cornelisz Hooftstraat, near the Rijksmusum, is the place to go. The open-air markets are also a 
must-visit - if for the colour and the smells alone. While the locals aren't buying the enormous clogs and windmills, 
they do buy the cheap flowers in massive quantities. As do the tourists.
The flights from Amsterdam were traditionally filled with people lugging bags of flower bulbs and big bouquets of 
tulips home. Nowadays, Ryanair would probably make you squeeze them into your one piece of hand luggage.
Accommodation options: try the centrally-located luxury boutique hotel, Fusion Suites Number 40.
How to get there: Aer Lingus operates daily flights between Dublin and Amsterdam.

Airport to reapply for permission for runway after appeal rejection

Dublin Airport is to reapply for planning permission for a second runway after An Bord Pleanála rejected its appeal 
against operating restrictions.
The airport had sought to fast-track its appeal on the basis that the runway constituted strategic infrastructure, but 
the planning board did not agree and said the planning application should go back to Fingal County Council. The 
local council had imposed restrictions on the operation of the second runway between 6am and 7am, and 11pm 
and midnight.
Vincent Wall, director of communications at Dublin Airport Authority, told travel industry professionals at a 
TravelMedia lunch last week that the airport's busiest time was between 6amand 7am. He said Aer Lingus and 
Ryanair, which were responsible for three-quarters of the traffic at the airport, needed to maximise the use of their 
fleets, as European airports were an hour ahead.
''You have to build a motorway system for the rush hour, not for the middle of the afternoon," Wall said.
Wall said the airport was now the 14th-busiest in the world and would handle about 24million passengers this year, 
compared with 11.8 million in 1998. Last month, 2.3 million passengers passed through the airport, which handled 
up to 93,000 passengers on its busiest days.
Overall, passenger traffic to the end of August was up 4 per cent, with transatlantic traffic up 25 per cent - largely 
due to the EU's new Open Skies policy. ''In 2003, no Poles flew direct from Poland to Dublin," said Wall. ''This year, 
one million have come."
Wall also said that new security channels would be introduced for business travellers when Terminal Two opened in 
spring 2010. Construction of the new terminal began on October 1 last year, and is proceeding on schedule.
The number of security channels in the airport is likely to rise from 18 to 25 with the opening of the new terminal. 
There will also be dedicated security channels for families, with play areas for children in the new terminal lounge.

British Airways canceled more than a dozen flights Friday following an air traffic control computer glitch a day 
earlier, the airline said.
British Airways flights within Britain and Europe headed to or leaving from Heathrow Airport were affected Friday. 
Other airports were back to normal.
The computer problem happened Thursday afternoon at a control center outside London run by air traffic control 
company Nats. The problem resulted in a restriction of the number of planes entering British airspace.
Air traffic control company Nats has had computer problems on several occasions since opening its control center 
in Hampshire in 2002.
"We take every step to avoid any problems but are always aware that in maintaining and updating highly complex 
systems we can experience difficulties," Nats' operational performance director Ian Hall said in a statement.
Budget airline Ryanair also reported some residual flight delays Friday.

Alice Ross finds smart operators can profit in a number of scenarios
Body
Worries about company balance sheets have brought suffering to shareholders throughout the year, but two other 
types of market player - the corporate predator and the spread better - have had a better time of it.
Takeover deals, or rumoured deals, have caused share prices of some companies to fluctuate dramatically, and 
speculation about which companies will be the next targets remains rife.
As the predators have circled, spread-betters have had more opportunities for quick profits, thanks to the leverage 
provided by trading bets on margin.
For example, traders with long positions in Alliance & Leicester made significant gains when the share price went 
up 55 per cent, following the takeover by Spanish bank Santander announced in July.
The difficulty, obviously, lies in anticipating a bid.
"After a bid has been made, or speculated about, you rarely see significant price increases," says Josh Raymond, 
market strategist at City Index.
One solution is to try to look for signals.
Adam Seagrave, sales trader at CMC Markets, says: "Cash rich companies can often be attractive targets, so those 
with a healthy balance sheet are worth watching."
Another indicator to look out for, he says, is stake-building - a "classic signal" that one company may be working 
towards a takeover bid for another.
Betters can also try to monitor the media to pick up speculation about bids - although being early off the mark is 
crucial.
Keep an eye on the signals
For example, on July 11, before Santander's 317p-per- share bid was announced, Capital Spreads, a betting 
provider, was quoting a price of 220p-221p for Alliance & Leicester shares. Following bid rumours over the 
weekend, on Monday this had risen to 240.5p-241.5p and then went up to 335p-336p when the takeover was 
announced.
This is unusual, though. Generally, by the time speculation is reported, it is likely the share price will already have 
risen. Even so, there are some trading strategies for making money after a bid is announced.
Prices can continue to go up if the market expects multiple bidders. In this situation, traders can go long after the 
initial announcement; while they may have missed the initial share price rise, they can benefit from any further 
increases as bidders compete.
Conversely, if the market anticipates difficulties for the bidder, prices can often fall after the initial bid euphoria. 
Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, points out that share prices tend to go up on the first day, but 
then drop on the second as traders lock in their gains, or concerns emerge about the takeover.
This provides a short-term intra-day trading opportunity. It was seen most recently after Ryanair's bid for Aer 
Lingus, after fears arose that regulators would not permit the merger.
Mr Raymond argues prices can fluctuate in both directions, as sentiment changes. "You rarely see a stock price 
head consistently in one direction after the initial big move, once a bid has been confirmed," he says. "What you 
commonly see, is prices fluctuate through a general trend to the upside. This see-saw effect creates great 
opportunities."
To make the right call, spread betters need to know the companies involved extremely well. "It's all about knowing 
the correct size, structure and make-up of the target and targeter - and the sector that they are in - to the finest 
detail," says Mr Campbell.
However, if you don't, there are some lower-risk ways to profit. One strategy is to bet on a whole sector: a takeover 
of one company may indicate that others in the sector will be targets, causing valuations to rise across the board. 
This was the case recently in mining and pharmaceuticals.
Another strategy is a "pairs trade" on the two companies involved in a takeover. Mr Seagrave says: "You could buy 
the target company in an attempt to profit from its share price rising whilst selling the bidding company in 
anticipation that its share price will fall."

Michael O'Leary's strategy of being the 'last-man-standing' in an industry that will see many more airlines go to the 
wall appears to be working, according to a report from Davy Research.
However, the key variable is oil and whether even Ryanair can withstand crude that's well above the USD100 a 
barrel level.
Aviation expert, Stephen Furlong, said the strategy is a risky one - but one worth trying nevertheless as Europe 
goes in to recession.
He added, however, that a falling oil price is crucial for Ryanair's strategy to work. "Ryanair is the most leveraged 
airline - if oil were to average USD100 per barrel compared with around USD120 in 2009, that would provide a 
E300 swing in fuel costs per tonne," he said. Davy believes that there will be many more failures in the industry as 
weaker business models than Ryanair's go under. "News from Ryanair's AGM that it can 'break-even' with oil prices 
at USD100 per barrel in the fourth quarter is encouraging but does not surprise us," says Furlong. "Previous 
guidance, assuming an un-hedged fourth quarter at USD130 per barrel, was for 'breakeven to minus E60m'. "Yield 
guidance remains at -5pc in the worst case scenario. Ryanair remains to some extent an oil play - every USD1 per 
barrel change will alter its fuel cost line by E15m in 2010," he said.

Michael O'Leary's strategy of being the 'last-man-standing' in an industry that will see many more airlines go to the 
wall appears to be working, according to a report from Davy Research.
However, the key variable is oil and whether even Ryanair can withstand crude that's well above the USD100 a 
barrel level.
Aviation expert, Stephen Furlong, said the strategy is a risky one - but one worth trying nevertheless as Europe 
goes in to recession.

(ANSA) - New York, September 25 - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will introduce on December 4, 2008 a new daily 
flight connecting the Riviera del Corallo airport in Alghero-Fertilia, on the southern Italian island of Sardinia, to the 
airport in Forli, in the central Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, the company announced.
The air carrier will thus raise the number of its flights offered from the airport in Alghero to 14. The flight will depart 
from Forli at 1250 local time, while from Alghero it will depart at 1505 local time, Ryanair explained. The company 
has launched a promotional campaign to celebrate the start of new flights offering free tickets on 765 European 
destinations.
Apart from the Forli-Alghero flight, Ryanair will start on December 4, 2008 flights connecting Forli to Bari, Cagliari, 
Lamezia, Olbia and Palermo, all in southern Italy. In March 2009 the Irish low-cost air carrier will probably start 
another two flights to connect Forli with Barcelona, northeastern Spain, and Brussels, Italy's news agency ANSA 
wrote on September 24, 2008. The air connections to be started in December 2008 and in March 2009 will replace 
the seven international flights, operated currently from Forli, which will be moved to the Guglielmo Marconi 
international airport in Bologna, northern Italy.

No-frills carrier, Ryanair, today said that it plans to open up two new routes to and from Shannon with 26 new flights 
a week from November.
Ryanair said it will base a sixth aircraft in Shannon which will allow it to launch the new routes to Frankfurt-Hahn 
and Newcastle.
It said the expansion involves another E70m investment by Ryanair in Shannon that will generate over 100 more 
jobs at the airport this winter.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "There's a double celebration at Shannon Airport this week. "We're celebrating the 
arrival of a 6th based aircraft and 2 new routes which go on sale today. "With 35 low fare Ryanair routes from 
Shannon, the people of the mid west region can buy the guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel surcharges all over 
the UK and Europe. "These 26 new weekly flights will bring more than 5,000 added passengers each week to 
Shannon airport. "To accommodate these new routes and increased frequencies we will stop flying the Shannon-
East Midland route and reduce frequencies on the Shannon-Luton route from 31st of October."

Highlight: Ryanair remains unhedged for its fuel needs beyond the end of this year and believes oil prices will 
resume their recent downward path.
Body
Ryanair remains unhedged for its fuel needs beyond the end of this year and believes oil prices will resume their 
recent downward path.
'We're not hedged beyond December 31 this year, but oil prices will probably continue to weaken, particularly as the 
United States (economy) seems to be continuing to weaken,' the Irish no-frills airline's Chief Financial Officer, 
Howard Millar, has told reporters in London.
Ryanair warned in July that stubbornly high fuel costs and lower ticket prices meant it could make its first loss since 
1989 this year.
The airline last week tweaked its guidance, saying it would break even this year if oil stayed at USD 100 a barrel 
and would return to 'substantial profitability' in 2009. Millar said Ryanair expected its average fares to fall about 5 
percent in 2008/9, despite its prediction that its profits could fall 'from 480 million euros down to zero' this year. 
'We're heading into recession and people are becoming much more price sensitive. Our experience of recession is 
that fares generally fall,' Millar said. 'We are already seeing signs of this ourselves, despite a reduction in capacity. 
'People are more price sensitive and carriers will struggle to fill their seats unless they reduce fares.' Millar said 
Europe's biggest budget airline was planning to reduce capacity by 14 percent at London's Stansted airport this 
winter as it grapples with fuel costs and weakening consumer demand. Last year, it mothballed seven aircraft based 
at the airport during the quieter winter months. Millar also said Ryanair expects its appeal against the EU's decision 
to block its proposed takeover of fellow Irish airline Aer Lingus to take place early next year. 'We would hope that 
sometime after that, we would be able to continue with our bid,' Millar said. 'It's closer to happening than it was last 
year.' Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said last year that the airline had begun working on plans for a no-
frills transatlantic airline. Millar said an eventual takeover by Ryanair of Aer Lingus could offer a way into the 
transatlantic market, but said any such operation would be a stand-alone legal entity. Ryanair could set up a

transatlantic airline alone if its efforts to buy Aer Lingus failed, although Millar said high oil prices and aircraft costs 
meant such developments were some way off. 'I wouldn't want you to read into this that we think we'll be in the long 
haul business in the next couple of years,' he said. Millar repeated Ryanair's view that more of its rivals would go 
bust during the winter, but said his company expected to grow passenger numbers in the year to the end of March 
by 14 percent to 58 million. 'Our plan is to continue to grow while offering low fares,' Millar said, adding that he 
expected the number of passengers Ryanair carries to grow 15 to 18 percent next year to between 65 and 68 
million. That would be backed up by what Millar described as a 'significant' route launch programme in the spring. 
Net of any aircraft disposals, Millar said Ryanair would take delivery of 122 new aircraft between now and 2012, 
adding to its existing fleet of 166 Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ryanair is talking to Boeing and Airbus about 'very 
significant' aircraft orders beyond 2012, he said. Despite the current downturn, Millar expects that by then, the 
airline will be carrying 80 million passengers a year and have annual profits of about 800 million euro. 'There's still 
going to be an appetite for low fares -- people are not going to sit in watching the TV, they're going to want to go on 
holiday,' Millar said. 'Low fares are here to stay and we'll continue to grow.' In separate statements, Ryanair said it 
was launching six routes from Forli in Italy, to Alghero, Bari, Cagliari, Lamezia, Olbia and Palermo. It also urged the 
European Commission to abandon plans to include airlines in Europe's Emissions Trading Scheme, saying it would 
penalise efficient airlines while protecting inefficient carriers. Copyright: Thomson Financial

Body
British airline easyJet could add new Italian routes at short notice in the event of the total collapse of Alitalia -- 
although it would expect to be awarded airport slots in return.
A spokesman for the low-cost carrier told Reuters on Tuesday that it could commit around ten aircraft on routes 
such as Milan-Rome, Milan-Naples and Milan-Palermo.
'EasyJet is prepared, at very short notice, to move into routes the Italian government cares about most ... We could 
commit in the region of ten aircraft,' the spokesman said.
Italy's loss-making national airline Alitalia has been sticking to its flight schedules despite the prospect of losing its 
operating licence in just a few days, unless the special administrator comes up with a credible new offer or cost-
cutting plan by Thursday. However, easyJet said it would not wish to buy Alitalia's vacant slots in the event of its 
collapse, but would expect to be awarded them by the Italian government in return for a swift resumption of service. 
'To operate on that route (Milan-Rome) easyJet would need to be given slots. If so, we would operate a number of 
routes per day,' the spokesman said. EasyJet's arch rival Ryanair, which also has a significant presence on 
domestic Italian routes, declined to comment on its plans. Alitalia also operates ten flights a day from London's 
Heathrow, but easyJet said it had no plans to start operations from the UK's busiest airport. British Airways, which 
has by far the most slots at Heathrow, with over 40 percent of the airport's total availability, would not comment 
specifically on Alitalia but said it would look at opportunities to expand its portfolio. 'We are always looking for 
opportunities to increase our slot portfolio at Heathrow,' a spokesman said. Copyright: Thomson Financial

'EasyJet is prepared, at very short notice, to move into routes the Italian government cares about most ... We could 
commit in the region of ten aircraft,' the spokesman said.
Italy's loss-making national airline Alitalia has been sticking to its flight schedules despite the prospect of losing its 
operating licence in just a few days, unless the special administrator comes up with a credible new offer or cost-
cutting plan by Thursday. However, easyJet said it would not wish to buy Alitalia's vacant slots in the event of its 
collapse, but would expect to be awarded them by the Italian government in return for a swift resumption of service. 
'To operate on that route (Milan-Rome) easyJet would need to be given slots. If so, we would operate a number of 
routes per day,' the spokesman said. EasyJet's arch rival Ryanair, which also has a significant presence on 
domestic Italian routes, declined to comment on its plans. Alitalia also operates ten flights a day from London's 
Heathrow, but easyJet said it had no plans to start operations from the UK's busiest airport. British Airways, which 
has by far the most slots at Heathrow, with over 40 percent of the airport's total availability, would not comment 
specifically on Alitalia but said it would look at opportunities to expand its portfolio. 'We are always looking for 
opportunities to increase our slot portfolio at Heathrow,' a spokesman said. Copyright: Thomson Financial

(ANSA) - Forli, Septemebr 24 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair will launch on December 4, 2008 flights connecting 
the Ridolfi airport in Forli, in the central Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, with Alghero, Bari, Cagliari, Lamezia, 
Olbia and Palermo, all in southern Italy.
The Irish low-cost air carrier will probably start in March 2009 another two flights to connect Forli with Barcelona, 
northeastern Spain, and Brussels.
The new domestic flights will be available daily. The air connections to be started in December 2008 and in March 
2009 will replace the seven international flights, operated currently from Forli, which will be moved to the Guglielmo 
Marconi international airport in Bologna, northern Italy.
Ryanair targets to increase the number of passengers serviced by the company at the Ridolfi airport to 500,000 by 
the end of 2009.
The president of Italian airport operator SEAF which manages the Ridolfi airport, Franco Rusticali, announced the 
information at a news conference. He said new international flights would be launched in spring 2009. The new 
flights will connect Forli with Paris, Warsaw, Riga and Amsterdam and will be probably operated by Italian low-cost 
airline WindJet. Rusticali will present the new industrial plan of SEAF to the company's shareholders meeting, 
called for October 1, 2008.

Ryanair remains unhedged for its fuel needs beyond the end of this year and believes that oil prices will resume 
their recent downward path after a record one-day rise on Monday.
Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar also told reporters at a news conference in London that Europe's biggest 
budget airline planned to ground 14 aircraft at London's Stansted airport this winter as it grapples with fuel costs 
and weakening consumer demand. Last year it mothballed seven aircraft based at the airport.
'We're heading into recession and people are becoming much more price sensitive. Our experience of recession is 
that fares generally fall,' Millar said.
'We are already seeing signs of this ourselves despite a reduction in capacity. People are more price sensitive and 
carriers will struggle to fill their seats unless they reduce fares.'

Irish stock exchange leaves Anglo weighting unchanged
Irish stock exchange leaves Anglo weighting unchanged

The Irish Stock Exchange has left Anglo Irish Bank's Iseq free float weighting unchanged despite the recent 
acquisition by billionaire investor Sean Quinn and his family of a 15 per cent stake in the bank.
The exchange, headed by Deirdre Somers, classifies a quoted company's free float based on the number of shares 
that are considered available for trading and which are not held by strategic or long-term investing.
Figures published by the exchange last week show that Anglo's free float classification stood at 97.4 per cent, 
largely unchanged on the last quarter. The exchange determined that just 2.6 per cent of Anglo shares - held by 
management - were not considered to be available for trading.
Quoted companies typically see a reduction in their free float when a major strategic investor acquires a stake. Aer 
Lingus's free float fell below 40 per cent after the exchange determined that 60 per cent held by the government, 
the unions and Ryanair was being held for the long term or for strategic reasons.
A reduction in a company's free float will reduce that company's Iseq weighting, following changes to the calculation 
of the Iseq introduced last year.
In the past, a company's Iseq weighting was based on its market capitalisation, but is now adjusted to take account 
of shares that are not considered available for trading. A lower free float is generally considered to be negative for a 
company, as it means the market for its shares is less liquid.
A spokesman for the exchange declined to comment.

Spread betting firms have suspended taking short trades on Irish bank stocks, following the Financial Regulator's 
move to stop short-selling of shares in Irish banks.
The regulator's ban on short-selling applies to AIB, Bank of Ireland, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life & Permanent 
and is primarily targeting large-scale speculative activity aimed at driving down the share prices of the four 
companies.
Many investors expected that spread betting would not be affected by the regulator's intervention as those 
engaging in the activity do not take a physical interest in the underlying stock but bet on whether its price will move 
up or down.
However, the ban on short-selling has now led to restrictions on financial spread betting for the coming weeks. Irish 
companies Paddypowertrader.com, Delta Index and Worldspreads suspended betting on the four Irish banks and 
29 British banks.
At this stage bets on groups of shares which include the bank stocks are not restricted by the move. Peter 
O'Donovan, head of financial spread betting at Paddypowertrader.com said the company was still offering limited 
avenues to allow customers to bet on share price falls.
''Some traders continue to short the Iseq ETF - a basket of the top 20 shares traded on the Iseq which include the 
four Irish banks - in an effort to gain some short exposure to Irish banks as they fall from their highs of early Friday 
morning," he said.
O'Donovan said bets on Irish banking stocks such as AIB, Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank are among the 
most popular trades in financial spread betting. Other popular trades focus on Ryanair, CRH and Elan.
While this is a blow to spread betting, it is being outweighed by the significant increase in overall financial spread 
betting activity sparked by recent volatility on the financial markets.
Banks off limits for financial spread betting
Delta Index's Chris Curran said spread betting was up 300 per cent last month and that most of its customers 
preferred to bet on the movement of an index rather than individual shares.
Paddypowertrader.com said trades doubled on Friday despite the ban on bank short-selling. Said O'Donovan: ''We 
are seeing a spike in customers trading equities as the markets bounce. This is not limited to banking stocks but 
also aviation, pharmaceutical and heavy industry."

A true taste of Sardinia
A true taste of Sardinia

Eclectic cuisine, mouthwatering wines and Old World charm await in the soulful Sardinian town of Alghero, writes 
Stuart Clark.
I know it's supposed to rank alongside Peter Andre and Pot Noodle as one of the things no sane person's supposed 
to like, but I've found myself becoming inordinately fond of Ryanair.
Forget complimentary chocolates with your in-flight coffee, all I want is cheap, direct access to parts of Europe that 
people previously had to swap planes or take a charter to reach.
A case in point is Alghero on Sardinia's north-west coast, formerly a nightmare to get to but now, thanks to that nice 
Michael O'Leary, is just three-and-a-half-hours from Dublin - and that includes the 70 cent bus ride into town.
Yup, unlike Paris Beauvais, Glasgow Prestwick and Brussels South, Alghero's Fertilia Airport is actually located 
within the municipal boundaries of the place it serves, ten kilometres from the centre of the town.
The bad news for those who require cheap Guinness or today's Daily Express to enjoy their holiday is that Alghero 
is a thoroughly Sardinian resort, with nary an Irish pub or Little Englander to be seen.
Which isn't to say that things don't get a little wild sometimes in the harbourside bars, which are obliged by law to 
close only for an hour a day.
If you like your hedonism mixed with Old World charm, head for the Cafe Latino (Piazza Duomo 6), where the 
show-off Gucci brigade rub wine glasses with elderly Algheresi who speak Catalan, the language adopted in the 
14th century when the town was colonised by the Spanish and briefly renamed Barcelonetta.
While there's not the overt hostility towards the mainland that exists in Sicily, the locals think of themselves as 
Sardinians first, Catalans second and - much to the disgust of Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who had a go 
at them over it recently - Italian third.
A true taste of Sardinia
If you want to get a proper feel for the place, avoid the characterless beachside hotels lining the Via Lido and stay in 
the Old Town, most of which dates back to medieval times. In another nod to its colonial past, the street names are 
all in the Algherese Catalano dialect - carer instead of 'via', placa for 'piazza', iglesia for 'chiesa' and palau for 
'palazzo'.
Any tour should start with a walk along the seawalls, or bastioni, which are dotted with the ramparts and towers that 
have protected the town with varying degrees of success since the 14th century.
The one that engenders the most civic pride is the Torre dello Sperone, a former prison flanked by the giant 
cannon, which gives Alghero's famous, red Cannonau di Sardegna wine its name.
The 1,600-acre Sella & Mosca estate where it is produced is one of the largest in Europe, and runs excellent tours 
and even better tastings, where you also get to sample their other reds and Torbato Terre Bianche, a vanillay white 
that has started appearing recently in off-licences here - albeit for at least double the EUR 5 it sells for in Sardinia 
(www.sellaandmosca.com).
Other tipples to look out for are the vermouth-like Punt'e Mes and Cynar, an artichoke-based sherry that's far more 
palatable than it sounds.
The latter is brought to the table with great ceremony in Al Tuguri (Via Maiorca), a tiny, family-run restaurant located 
off the Piazza Ginnasio.
Specialising in la culcina Algherese, its must-tries include culurgiones (ravioli stuffed with potato & cheese), fainé 
(chickpea pizza), saburrida (dogfish marinated in garlic, parsley, walnuts & vinegar) and paradulas (cheese 
flavoured with saffron, vanilla, orange and lemon peel).
For an even more authentic dining experience, head inland to Sassari, a pleasantly earthy town famous - or should 
that be infamous? - for its sa córdula (roasted sheep's entrails), gran premio (horsemeat steak) and giogghe (snails 
fried with garlic and paprika). I couldn't summon the courage to try the first two, but the snails in Da Peppina (Vicolo 
Pigozzi) proved to be the best fiver I'd spent all year.
Find a restaurant that doesn't offer an English translation of its menu, or better still, has no menu at all, and even 
with far too much of the house wine, you can eat handsomely for EUR 20 a head.
If you're not buying into this adventurous eating lark, a rather more conventional day-trip is to the Grotta di Nettuno, 
a cave complex that's every bit as spectacular as the cliff-hugging 30-minute boat ride that ferries you there from 
Alghero.
Sun-worshippers should get the bus to Porto Conte, a blue bay known back in Roman times as the Lake of 
Nymphs. Nowadays, those nymphs are joined by plenty of posing Sardinian stallions who come to see and be seen 
on its sandy beaches. Its other big attraction is the J&B Sailing Club, which also rents out windsurfing gear and 
organises day and nighttime scuba expeditions for all levels of expertise (www.lebombarde.com).
Back in Alghero, there's no better way to end the day than grabbing a table outside one of the seafront bars and 
drinking a toast to Michael O'Leary for bringing you to a part of the Mediterranean that's managed to retain all of its 
unique character.
Getting there

Roller-coaster ride sets nerves jangling across broad spectrum of UK plc

  Job losses and travel cutbacks at banks are set to deepen an anticipated move into losses at British Airways, 
according to analysis by Citigroup.
The airline has benefited from a boom in business class travel generated by the banking sector in recent years, 
particularly on high margin transatlantic routes.
But in a note yesterday, analysts at Citi suggested troubles in the financial sector will hit short-term demand for 
premium bookings.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair, predicted more woes for the sector.
"There will be further airline bankruptcies in Europe over the coming weeks, as more of Europe's non-viable, 
lossmaking airlines run out of cash or their credit facilities are withdrawn," he said.
  The view among estate agents was that the past week's events have not helped an already fragile market.
Liam Bailey, head of residential research at Knight Frank, said: "Until this week things were getting better . . . What 
has happened in the past week has had a large impact on consumer confidence, not least the news on job losses."
Jonathan Hewlett, head of Savills in London said: "Going forward it seems to make sense that the fall in prices 
could be more than 25 per cent, but it is too early to tell."
In relation to the HBOS and Lloyds TSB merger, Mr Hewlett described the 28 per cent share of the mortgage 
market, which the merged entity would control, as a "bit scary".
  Gold mining looks like one of the few industries that could emerge stronger after this week, as investors follow the 
time-worn instinct of retreating to their haven.
However, shares in London-listed gold miners tell opposite stories, and the deciding factor is size. The biggest gold 
companies - such as Randgold, Peter Hambro and Hochschild - have fared well. They are safe bets for investors 
because they have solid financing and are reassuringly extracting gold out of the ground day by day.
Roller-coaster ride sets nerves jangling across broad spectrum of UK plc
However, Aim-listed gold miners and explorers continue to be punished. To the conservative investor they look as 
risky as a 1990s internet company: all promise and no material.
"The gold bull market has been here for so long that it has built up a lot of promise," said Mark Bristow, chief 
executive of Randgold, an Africa-focused gold miner. "But after a collapse like this, hedge funds and other investors 
immediately turn away, and to do well you have to have sufficient cash to support yourself, because at this stage in 
the cycle wanting to find money from the markets is not going to be easy."
Bob Foster, chief executive of Stratex, a small, Turkey-focused gold explorer, calls the current market 
"exasperating".
At least 50 per cent of mineral explorers would face a serious cash crunch in the next three months, he said.
  For the leisure sector, which has suffered everything that the consumer downturn could throw at it for much of this 
year, this week's meltdown merely weakened an already bad hand.
Yesterday's share price rises could not gloss over another mauling as pub groups, and any other leisure company 
with bricks and mortar, suffered double- digit falls over the week.
Meanwhile, fears among the spreadbetters that the ban on short-selling will damage business proved short-lived. 
Analysts reinforced the message from companies such as IG and London Capital Group that they had very little 
trade in short-selling.

Richard Hemans  on the benefits of better marketing
Body
As a small island, Guernsey recognises the importance of tourism. Residents and businesses alike depend on the 
visitor economy to provide a robust transport infrastructure and comprehensive leisure facilities.
In 2006, following years of decline in passenger movements and hotel occupancy, the States developed a new 
strategy focused on access, accommodation and marketing. This strategy is now starting to bear fruit.
Chris Elliott, director of tourism at the commerce and employment department, says: "It can be expensive to get to 
Guernsey, but we have tried to broaden our potential market and make access easier by developing the island's air 
links. New routes tend to be unprofitable in the first couple of years so we have offered subsidies to operators."
The result is that Flybe has launched new routes from the island to Paris Charles de Gaulle and Dublin, while Blue 
Islands has started services to Geneva and Zurich. Although it is unlikely that low-cost airlines such as Ryanair will 
come to Guernsey, given the size of the market and the airport runway, Mr Elliott hopes to encourage further routes 
such as London City.
"With the economic slowdown and high oil prices, airlines are concentrating on survival right now," says Mr Elliott. 
"The price of flights will probably rise, but Guernsey may benefit from its closeness to the UK and the availability of 
slots if airlines fail. We must address urgently the island's runway, which is too small for some aircraft and needs 
upgrading."
With the emergence of the low-cost airlines and the development of European destinations in the 1990s, tourism in 
Guernsey began to wane. Chris Sharp, director of La Fregate Hotel, says: "There was excess capacity in the 
accommodation sector. Falling occupancy levels meant decreasing profits, which led to lower investment at a time 
when customers were becoming more sophisticated."
The planning laws made it very difficult for hotel owners to change the use of their property. When the legislation 
changed in 2006, three major hotels and several guest houses left the industry, leading to a 5 per cent drop in the 
bed stock.
New strategy begins to deliver
"Operators have more confidence now and are starting to invest, because they expect to make a return given the 
reduction in total capacity. Standards are improving with the number of four-star hotels up to six," says Mr Sharp. 
The Bella Luce, La Fregate and the Fleur du Jardin have all undergone major refurbishment, while the Red 
Carnation Group has taken over the Old Government House.
The States has also carried out market research to pinpoint the customer base.
"Previously, a large proportion of the £2.4m marketing budget was misallocated," says Mr Elliott. "Following our 
research, however, we know that 85 per cent of our customers live in the UK, and that they are predominantly over-
45s who live less than two hours from an airport and are looking for a short break. We can now target our 
advertising accordingly."
The island is fortunate that this demographic is already substantial, growing quickly, and wealthy. "We need the 
island to remain a mass-market destination and not to become exclusive, but this part of the population does 
appreciate Guernsey's finer qualities, such as its status as a genuine, living community and a place of outstanding 
natural beauty," says Mr Elliott.
The latest statistics suggest that Guernsey's tourism market is starting to recover. There has been a 3.5 per cent 
overall increase in passenger movements in the seven months to the end of July, including a 6.2 per cent rise at the 
airport. Occupancy rates are higher in hotels and self-catering accommodation. The average length of stay has 
increased to 4.1 days.
For Mr Elliott, the future holds more of the same. "We are seeking stable growth in visitor numbers. We expect to 
see more visitors from Europe as the new air routes start to prosper, and we will focus more of our future marketing 
on France and Ireland," he says.
Although growth seems to be levelling off as the UK economy slows, there is still a mood of cautious optimism in 
the industry. "Tourism is in much healthier shape now than it was five years ago," says Mr Sharp. "There is nothing 
we can do about a possible recession, the price of oil or even the weather. But we can invest in our air links, quality 
of accommodation and effective marketing, and must continue to do so."

Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC rose Thursday after Europe's leading budget airline raised its outlook for this fiscal 
year, forecasting it would break even, because of the falling price of oil.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told an annual meeting of shareholders at Dublin Airport that his airline no longer 
feared it would fall into the red the fiscal year ending in March because of surging oil prices. He said a break-even 
was more likely as long as oil remained below $100 a barrel.
O'Leary said the recent relaxation in oil prices would not immediately help Ryanair because most of its fuel supplies 
for the October-December quarter had already been purchased at prices equivalent to $124 a barrel. But he said 
lower oil prices would allow Ryanair to "return to substantial profitability" in 2009.
Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC initially jumped 7 percent on the news, but ended the day down 1.6 percent at 2.52 
euros ($3.62) on the Irish Stock Exchange.
In July, facing the prospect of a bleak winter, the Dublin-based airline announced it would trim about 15 percent of 
its routes from October and ground nearly a third of its aircraft at its major base, Stansted, northeast of London. It 
also froze executives' salaries.
Ryanair at the time said it was on course for a 60 million euros ($87 million) loss in this fiscal year. Its forecast was 
based on the premise that oil would remain near $130 a barrel, but since then the price has fallen below the $100 
threshold.
On Thursday, O'Leary forecast that more Ryanair competitors soon would collapse, following the failures this month 
of Canadian-based Zoom Airlines, Spain-based Futura International Airways and London-based charter XL 
Airways.
"We believe there will be further airline bankruptcies in Europe over the coming weeks, as more of Europe's non-
viable, loss-making airlines run out of cash or their credit facilities are withdrawn," O'Leary said.
Ryanair raises outlook as oil price falls
"The extraordinary pace of European airline consolidation will also continue," he said. "There is no doubt that most 
of Europe's flag carrier airlines will merge into three large, high-fare groupings led by BA (British Airways), Air 
France and Lufthansa this winter."
In an interview, O'Leary conceded that Ryanair made a tactical blunder by failing to buy sufficient fuel-hedging 
contracts.
"I did screw up by not hedging our fuel needs at below $100 a barrel. But we never thought it was going to move 
from $70 to $140 a barrel," he said.
O'Leary's presentation was interrupted by a lone heckler who was wearing only a pair of trousers and a mask and 
had scrawled "Exposing O'Leary's Lies" on his bare chest. He identified himself as Rob Mack from an 
environmentalist group called Plane Mad that opposes the growth of airline travel on the grounds it is a 
disproportionate producer of climate changing-emissions.
O'Leary countered that Ryanair's fleet of relatively new Boeing 737-800s was among the cleanest in the industry.

Britain's FTSE 100 index is seen opening 6 to 7 points lower on Thursday, financial bookmakers said, after sinking 
to its lowest closing level since May 2005 in the previous session.
The UK benchmark, however, was expected to fare better than Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40 as traders 
said the proposed takeover of HBOS by Lloyds would help ease investor jitters.
'The fact that one bank in the UK that was at risk of having serious problems was HBOS. Now the that fact Lloyds is 
taking over obviously calm the nerves,' said Matthew Buckland, a dealer at CMC Markets.
A person familiar with the matter said Lloyds has agreed to buy HBOS to create a 28 billion pound ($50 billion) 
mortgage company, making it the latest troubled bank to be forced into the arms of a better-funded rival.
Overnight, U.S. stocks dropped to a three-year low as the U.S. rescue of insurer American International Group 
failed to calm a crisis of confidence in global markets and banks were wary of lending to each other. In Asia, 
Japan's Nikkei average fell 2.9 percent.
However, the Government of Singapore Investment Corp, the world's second-largest sovereign fund, said it will 
explore investing in Morgan Stanley if it is approached.
The FTSE 100 closed down 113.2 points, or 2.3 percent at 4,912.4 on Wednesday, extending its losses for the 
week to 9.3 percent, as investors fretted that a global credit crisis would claim more victims after Lehman Brothers 
failed and insurer AIG had to be bailed out.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Shares in Irish low-cost airline Ryanair are up more than 6.5 percent as the carrier says it will return to 'substantial 
profitability' next year if the price of oil continues to fall.
'It's true that the financial model bounces back providing oil stays at these levels,' says Collins Stewart analysts 
Andrew Fitchie, referring to previous Ryanair forecasts for losses based on a higher oil price.

10:33GMT 18 Sept2008-Severfield Rowen up; RBS repeats 'buy', sees value
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shares in Severfield Rowen gain 5.7 percent to 271.5 pence as RBS repeats its 'buy' rating, while cutting its target 
price to 315 pence from 431 after updating its model and forecasts in the wake of the firm's recent interim results, 
released on August 27.
RBS says it believes the construction engineering group made good progress in the first half and it has left its full 
year 2008 pretax profit estimates unchanged at 50 million pounds.
However, RBS say it has reduced its full year 2009 and 2010 forecasts to factor in a margin decline given the 
potential impact of further softening in the UK markets and the impact of offsetting this with more overseas work.
RBS concludes that while an investment in Severfield is not without risk, it believes the shares still offer value and 
feels overseas joint venture's could be an interesting opportunity for the group.

12:01GMT 18Sept2008-BA slumps on financial crisis, pensions
-----------------------------------------------------------
Shares in British Airways are down nearly 10 percent as investors fret over the twin threats of a fall in business 
class passengers caused by the financial crisis and a 1.5 billion pound pension deficit, analysts say.
'The shares may be affected by the financial meltdown -- around 50 percent of BA's corporate contracts are related 
to financial services, accountancy and law,' says Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Andrew Lobbenberg, although BA 
would not comment on its exposure to particular sectors.
BA said earlier its pension deficit at the end of March was 1.5 billion pounds ($2.74 billion), a snap-shot a 
spokesman says reflects 'weakness in the markets, the poor performance of equities and high interest rates'.

11:01GMT 18Sept2008-Ryanair gains on hopes for return to profit
---------------------------------------------------------------
Shares in Irish low-cost airline Ryanair are up more than 6.5 percent as the carrier says it will return to 'substantial 
profitability' next year if the price of oil continues to fall.
'It's true that the financial model bounces back providing oil stays at these levels,' says Collins Stewart analysts 
Andrew Fitchie, referring to previous Ryanair forecasts for losses based on a higher oil price.

STOCKS NEWS EUROPE- BA slumps on financial crisis, pensions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shares in Severfield Rowen gain 5.7 percent to 271.5 pence as RBS repeats its 'buy' rating, while cutting its target 
price to 315 pence from 431 after updating its model and forecasts in the wake of the firm's recent interim results, 
released on August 27.
RBS says it believes the construction engineering group made good progress in the first half and it has left its full 
year 2008 pretax profit estimates unchanged at 50 million pounds.
However, RBS say it has reduced its full year 2009 and 2010 forecasts to factor in a margin decline given the 
potential impact of further softening in the UK markets and the impact of offsetting this with more overseas work.
RBS concludes that while an investment in Severfield is not without risk, it believes the shares still offer value and 
feels overseas joint venture's could be an interesting opportunity for the group.

A surge in Ryanair shares following the airline's AGM statement this morning and a partial recovery in Bank of

By midday, the index was 56.02 points higher at 3,915.17.

the US, Washington Mutual, the giant US savings and loan beleaguered by mortgage losses, has put itself up for 
sale, sources familiar with the matter have said. The news sent the Nikkei average down 2.2pc to a three-year

scrambling for merger partners. In London, the FTSE gained 88 points as battered banking stocks rose as major

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary this morning reiterated that the airline should break even in 2008 despite the slump in 
crude oil prices.
The airline has hedged most of its third quarter fuel requirements at USD124 a barrel, but remains unhedged for the 
fourth quarter, he told the airline's AGM.
Whilst Ryanair expects to pay less for oil in the last three months of this year, these savings may well be eaten up 
by lower yields this winter, as the UK, Irish and European economies go into recession and consumer confidence 
plummets, Mr O'Leary said.
He said that the airline will respond to these negative trends by cutting prices and would survive the current turmoil 
while many other European airlines fail. He added that the airline's has a capital base of E2 billion, which makes it 
far more stable than its competitors. "We believe there will be further airline bankruptcies in Europe over the coming 
weeks, as more of Europe's non-viable, loss making airlines run out of cash or their credit facilities are withdrawn," 
he said. He forecast that the extraordinary pace of airline consolidation will continue. "There is no doubt that most of 
Europe's flag carrier airlines will merge into three large high fare groupings led by BA, Air France and Lufthansa this 
Winter," he said. "We expect that the European Commission will rubber-stamp approval of these mergers, which 
will help Ryanair's appeal against the EU's prohibition of our 2006 much smaller merger with Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus 
(which is again losing money) is far too small to survive as an independent regional airline, and we believe its future 
can best be secured as part of one strong Irish airline group (where it would continue to be separately branded and 
managed), rather than being a tiny subsidiary of a high fare airline grouping controlled from London, Paris or 
Frankfurt," he added.

Irish low cost carrier Ryanair <RYA.L> said on Thursday it would break even in the current year if oil remains at 
$100 a barrel, and would return to profitability next year if the price continued to fall.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement for the annual general meeting that the group remained 
unhedged on the oil price for the fourth quarter to end March.

EasyJet braced for 40% fall in pre-tax profits amid slowdown
EasyJet braced for 40% fall in pre-tax profits amid slowdown

EasyJet has warned that the strength of the euro and a worsening consumer environment in the UK would slow the 
strong gains in revenue per seat it had achieved over the summer.
The low-cost carrier, commenting in the light of failures among rival aircraft operators such as Zoom and XL, 
estimated the industry faced a reduction in capacity of between 2 and 4 per cent over the winter. But it said 
conditions remained too volatile for it to forecast how that reduced capacity would help its efforts to protect yields on 
its own flights.
In an update yesterday, EasyJet maintained guidance that its pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 would be 
down 40 per cent at £110m-£120m, excluding £12m of one-off costs.
Revenue per seat at EasyJet rose about 15 per cent in the second half. But faced with high fuel costs, adverse 
currency movements and a worsening economic climate, EasyJet will only modestly increase the number of seats it 
offers over the winter, as it attempts to defend margins.
For the next financial year, EasyJet said it had hedged 48 per cent of its fuel requirements at $1,225 a tonne, a 
sharp increase in volume from the 28 per cent it had hedged by late July, and at a lower price. It has also hedged 
70 per cent of its dollar requirement at $1.96 to the pound and 80 per cent of its anticipated euro surplus at 
EUR1.24 to the pound.
The airline first warned in March that full-year profits would be lower, then analysts downgraded their profits 
estimates by a quarter. When the company suggested in July the fall would be about 40 per cent, it slipped 10 per 
cent.
Rival Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has also seen strong passenger figures but serious erosion in its profitability. It 
has said it could fall into a full-year loss for the first time in 11 years.
EasyJet shares fell 8¼p yesterday to close at 350p.

Ryanair has told its pilots that it is imposing recruitment freeze and asked for volunteers to take "unpaid winter 
leave".
In a memo to its 1,700 pilots, who can earn about £100,000 a year, the airline said it had been "inundated" with 
applications from pilots who had recently lost their jobs.
It also claimed that a strike at Boeing had delayed plane deliveries, leaving it "overstaffed".
The memo warned: "If we do not receive sufficient applications on/before the end of September, then we will 
allocate unpaid leave to some Dublin and Stansted based pilots from November onwards."

Sept 17 (Reuters) - Greece said on Wednesday it would close Olympic Airlines and relaunch it as a private 
company, ending years of wrangling with Brussels over the loss-making state airline.
Following is a snapshot of ailing European airlines:
ALITALIA
- Once a symbol of Italy's post-war boom, flag carrier Alitalia sought bankruptcy protection on Aug. 29, after nearly 
two years of seeking a buyer.
- It loses more than 2 million euros a day and had nearly 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in debt as of July.
- Has for years suffered from political interference, labour disputes and financial woes. The Italian government has 
a 49.9 percent stake.
- Alitalia's bankruptcy commissioner warned on Wednesday the airline was running out of cash for fuel and flights 
could be grounded.
XL LEISURE GROUP
- Britain's third largest package holiday operator XL Leisure Group grounded all flights last Friday after going into 
administration, leaving tens of thousands of holidaymakers stranded. XL said it had been unable to obtain fresh 
funding after suffering from high fuel prices and the economic downturn.
- XL Airways flew to over 50 destinations and carried 2.3 million passengers last year. It had 1,700 staff worldwide.
* SAS
- In August, Scandinavian airline SAS outlined fresh cost cuts and revenue measures in an attempt to stem losses. 
The airline -- half-owned by Sweden, Norway and Denmark -- reported a pre-tax loss of 106 million Swedish crowns 
($17 million) in the second quarter. In June, it abandoned plans to sell its loss-making Spanair unit due to tough 
market conditions. Last week, Germany's Lufthansa said it was in talks to buy SAS.
* SPANAIR
FACTBOX-Airline industry woes in Europe
- SAS-owned Spanair announced it was slashing a third of its workforce when on Aug. 20 a Spanair MD-82 crashed 
on take-off at Madrid's Barajas airport, killing 154 people on board. In May, Iberia pulled out of the bidding process, 
citing worsening sector conditions.
* FALLING PROFITS
- The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said global airlines are set to post losses of $5.2 billion this 
year and $4.1 billion in 2009 as high oil prices and a global financial crisis weigh.
- IATA estimates higher crude prices will add $91 billion to the global airline fuel bill.
- Air France-KLM, the world's biggest airline by sales, announced on Aug 5 its first-quarter net profit more than 
halved to 168 million euros ($262 million).
- Days before, British Airways reported an 88 percent crash in first-quarter profit in what the airline called the worst-
ever trading conditions.
- Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, posted an 85 percent fall in profit at the end of July and warned of a full-
year loss if oil prices stayed high.
- Iberia posted a 3.9 million euro operating loss in the second quarter versus a 56.8 million euro profit a year earlier.

Ryanair has called on British airports operator, BAA, to sell off Stansted.
Grupo Ferrovial's BAA said this morning that it is putting its Gatwick airport in London up for sale.
'We have decided to begin the process of selling Gatwick Airport immediately,' Colin Matthews, chief executive of 
BAA, told journalists in Toronto.
Ryanair said it believes that this morning's announcement by the BAA that it was putting Gatwick up for sale is just 
the "latest attempt by this monopoly to hang on to Stansted, and to continue to overspend on facilities which users 
don't want and further increase Stansted's high charges while providing an abject service to airlines and 
passengers". Ryanair chief, Michael O'Leary, said the Gatwick decision is just the latest attempt by the BAA 
monopoly to get itself off the hook of the Competition Commission's recommendations. "Airlines and passengers 
have been abused for many years with high prices and abysmal service at all of the BAA's London and Scottish 
airports and the "trick" of selling off Gatwick won't end this abusive monopoly. Ryanair calls on the Competition 
Commission and the UK Government to take early steps to force the early sale of Stansted and at least one of the 
Scottish airports, so that real competition can be introduced in time for Summer 2009, and the BAA airport 
monopoly (which has finally been exposed by the Competition Commission as being bad for consumers and bad for 
competition) - can at last be broken up," he said.

Natixis leads the rout among banks

European shares tumbled to a three-year low as fears for the future of US insurance group AIG and a sharp drop in 
profit at Goldman Sachs fuelled the continuing sell-off in financial stocks.
Falling oil and metal prices added further downward pressure.
The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 was down 2.6 per cent to 1,091.38 points, bringing its losses for this week to 
6.5 per cent. The index has lost more than 27 per cent this year.
French investment bank Natixis sank 16.1 per cent to EUR2.50, leading the rout in banking stocks as interbank 
lending rates soared.
Another leading faller was UBS , which dived 17.2 per cent to SFr16.64. The Swiss investment bank said its 
exposure to Lehman Brothers was now substantially closed out and it did not expect the total cost of closing out its 
remaining exposures to exceed $300m.
Germany's Commerzbank lost 12.2 per cent to EUR13.97. Fortis slid 11.5 per cent to EUR7.39, paring losses 
after the Belgo-Dutch bank denied talk of an imminent rights issue. Short-covering and rumours that Spain's Banco 
Popular could be in merger talks with smaller peer Banco Pastor drove the stock up 5.6 per cent to EUR7.53.
Meanwhile, the country's central bank said Spanish banks' exposure to Lehman Brothers was minimal. Banesto 
rose 7.6 per cent to EUR9.51, while Santander edged up 0.2 per cent to EUR10.58.
Meanwhile, storm clouds over AIG subdued the European insurance sector. Swiss Re tumbled 13 per cent to 
EUR54.05, Germany's Allianz fell 5.6 per cent to EUR98.06, while France's Axa  lost 2.9 per cent to EUR19.76.
Germany's ZEW economic sentiment index indicator came in stronger than expected but provided little comfort for 
beleaguered equities.
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt fell 1.6 per cent to 5,965.17, while the CAC 40 in Paris slid 2 per cent to 4,087.40.
Natixis leads the rout among banks
Oil shares fell after another drop in the price of crude, which hovered at around $93 a barrel.
Norway's StatoilHydro fell 5.2 per cent to NKr131.90, France's Total  slid 2.7 per cent to EUR42.22 and OMV in 
Austria lost 9.2 per cent to EUR34.55. Portugal's Galp Energia lost 5.5 per cent to EUR11.24.
The falling oil price boosted Deutsche Lufthansa,  which rose 1.1 per cent to EUR15 but failed to lift budget carrier 
Ryanair, which was flat on the day at EUR2.72.
With few bright spots in the market, traders latched on to rumours in the building materials sector that Holcim was 
the target of a takeover.
The Swiss cement maker's shares climbed 3.2 per cent to SFr87 on speculation that Lafarge , the world's leading 
cement group, may make an offer.
In the building materials sector Holcim rose 3.2 per cent to SFr87.00. Other talk was of Russian stake-building. 
Shares in Lafarge rose 1 per cent to EUR81.42.
There was also speculation that Spanish construction group FCC could be a bid target after rumours circulated that 
Colonial, the property group, had sold its 15 per cent stake.
Shares in FCC rose 2 per cent to EUR31.74, in spite of Colonial's denial of the sale rumours. Bid rumours also

EU to fine Olympic Air 800 mln euros -paper

The European Union is set to give its green light for the closure of Greek carrier Olympic Airlines and will fine it 800 
million euros ($1.12 billion) for illegal state aid, daily Imerisia reported on Tuesday.
The EU Commission will meet this week to approve a Greek government plan to shut down the ailing airline and 
transfer its assets to a new entity called Pantheon, the newspaper said without citing sources.
The EU will fine Olympic over illegal state aid during 2005-2007, after competitors Ryanair and Aegean claimed the 
government was continuing to provide assistance in breach of EU state aid rules, it said.
No one at Olympic was immediately available for comment.
According to the plan, the new carrier will eventually take on the Olympic name and hold on to its most valuable 
landing slots. It will only be about 65 percent of the carrier's current size, and about 8,000 employees will be fired or 
transferred.
The new carrier's international flights will be drastically cut, with the plan set to be completed by early 2009, the 
paper reported.
Greece has tried and failed over years to find a buyer for the loss-making carrier. The government has said it may 
either find a buyer or re-establish the airline as a new entity by the end of 2008.
The commission first ruled in 1996 that Greece was in breach of EU state aid rules and ordered Olympic to pay 
back hundreds of millions of euros it received in the 1990s.

12:46GMT 16Sept2008-European airlines rise on falling oil price
---------------------------------------------------------------
Shares of airline companies rise on the falling oil price, with Germany's Lufthansa up 1.7 percent, Britain's easyJet 
up 3.6 percent and Ireland's Ryanair up 1.1 percent.
'Airline shares are up due to the falling oil but also the exchange rate -- in the past the falling oil has been 
neutralised by the strengthening dollar, but this past week the two trends have been more in favour,' says an 
analyst on condition of anonymity.
'The oil price is falling but the fuel surchange remains, which has to be positive for a company's earnings situation,' 
adds a Frankfurt-based trader.
Oil falls to $92 a barrel, while the dollar steadies near 4-month lows versus the yen. For more double click on

-----------------------------------------------------------
Shares in John Wood Group and AMEC down 6.7 and 5.5 percent respectively in tandem with a weaker crude price 
and after RBS highlights worries that at current levels key Canadian oil sands projects could be uneconomic.
RBS says several UK fund managers and environmental groups will meet on Tuesday for the UK Social Investment 
Forum to discuss the financial and environmental risks of Canadian oil sands.
The broker says with oil sands projects highly energy intensive, the meeting will campaign against plans for oil 
sands investment on environmental and financial grounds.
RBS says AMEC and Wood Group are the main UK stocks with exposure to the Canadian oil sands project which 
represent 9-10 percent of AMEC's group revenues and 4-5 percent of Wood Group's revenues.

10:46 GMT 16Sept2008-Swiss Re falls sharply on AIG fallout fears
----------------------------------------------------------------
Shares in Europe's second-largest reinsurance company Swiss Re fall more than 8 percent on fears it could suffer 
because of troubles faced by U.S. insurance giant American International Group.
AIG, thrown a $20 billion lifeline by New York state, comes under renewed pressure as ratings agencies downgrade 
the insurer's debt and the financial sector meltdown spread. Fears that AIG, once the world's largest insurer by 
market value, could be the next financial giant to tumble fuel worries about the potential fallout.
'On one hand Hurricane Ike in the United States caused a lot of damage, on the other hand the latest negative 
reports from the financial sector -- especially about AIG -- weighed (on Swiss Re shares),' analysts at Swiss private 
bank Maerki Baumann & Co, say in a note.
Swiss Re declines to comment on AIG exposure.
But shares in sector number one Munich Re pare early losses after it says it has no significant exposure to AIG. Its 
shares are down 1.9 percent.
The DJ Stoxx European insurer index falls 3.6 percent.

----------------------------------------------------------
Shares in Ferrexpo jump as much as 6.3 percent, outperforming other UK-listed miners which are all in negative 
territory, after the Ukrainian iron ore producer says it has bought 19.4 million of its own shares as part of its share 
repurchase programme.
'They bought 19 million of their own shares back and that perceives to be very good news,' a London-based trader 
says. 'They have a dire performance of late.'
Ferrexpo is up 0.4 percent at 1021 GMT. The stock has lost 34 percent so far this month after falling 10.9 percent 
last month and 27 percent in July.

Game Group shares fall as much as 11 percent to a 6-month low of 194 pence on concerns the British computer 
games retailer will be hit by cut-price competition from the likes of Morrison and Woolworths, as well as profit taking 
after a strong outperformance this year.
'This is a stock that's done pretty well and it's also held widely by U.S. fund managers,' says Altium Securities 
analyst David O'Brien, who expects the shares to go below his price target of 200 pence before bouncing back.
Shore Capital's John Stevenson thinks 2008 will prove the peak of the current computer games cycle, but also 
expects demand to be strong in the run up to Christmas.
Game Group shares are down 7 percent at 1006 GMT.

---------------------------------------------------------
Shares in Fidessa Group drop 5 percent after Panmure Gordon downgrades the trading platform systems group to 
'hold' from 'buy' and cuts its estimates and price target.
Panmure Gordons says failed U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers accounts for 2 percent of Fidessa's revenue.
The broker says Fidessa has many revenue drivers which remain intact, but it has long argued that information 
technology being late stage is not immune to the credit crunch and investors need to be mindful of this for 2009 
forecasts more than 2008.
Panmure Gordon says it has cut its 2009 forecasts by 10 percent to 26.1 million pounds to account for fewer 
software sales, price pressure on data service and poorer consultant utilisation. The broker also reduces its target 
price to 908 pence from 1,056 pence.

Shares in Eleco fall 6.5 percent on the group's cautious outlook, despite the building systems and software group 
posting a 40 percent rise in full year pretax profits.
'Trading conditions will be tough this year. However, we will apply the same measured and positive approach to our 
business in the year ahead, albeit against a backdrop of increasingly difficult market conditions,' says John 
Ketteley, executive chairman of Eleco.
Broker Collins Stewart says: 'Uncertainty across end user markets will weigh on sentiment and potentially 
performance, but on current forecasts the shares look cheap.' It retains its 'buy' recommendation and 117 pence 
target price.
The broker says the results are solid in difficult market conditions and makes upgrades to its 2008/09 estimates.

Airlines of every size and status, from the staunchly low-cost to the fervently high-end, are no longer taking a wait-
and-see approach to connectivity, as systems developed by AeroMobile, Aircell and OnAir prove successful, and 
others from Row 44 and Panasonic Avionics show promise.
"Connectivity is the buzz word of the show. It is finally coming to reality," says Panasonic Avionics director of 
corporate sales and product Neil James. 
During the event, in-flight cellphone system operator AeroMobile announced that it is in advanced talks with four 
more carriers, which would add to its existing customer base comprising Emirates, Qantas, Saudi Arabian Airlines, 
Turkish Airlines and V Australia.
In addition, rival OnAir secured its first contract in Latin America through a deal with Brazilian carrier TAM to 
introduce mobile connectivity in mid-2009. Chinese carrier Shenzhen Airlines is bypassing trials of the system 
completely and should start offering its passengers the service before the end of the year after its original target 
slipped. And Irish budget carrier Ryanair is expected to start testing OnAir within the next couple of weeks once 
final regulatory approvals are in place.
Boasting perhaps one of the biggest announcements, however, was Aircell, which revealed that Air Canada has 
become its fourth customer, agreeing to ultimately equip its entire domestic fleet with the Colorado-based firm's 
WiFi offering.
By spring 2009 Air Canada will begin offering Aircell's Gogo service aboard Airbus A319 aircraft on select 
transborder flights to the US west coast. Gogo is supported by Aircell's existing air-to-ground (ATG) network and 
only available in the USA. The service will become available to Air Canada passengers once the aircraft reaches 
US airspace.
Carriers embrace new connectivity INTRODUCTION: AeroMobile, Aircell and OnAir systems prove their worth 
as contracts are signed and second wave shows promise
However, Aircell is working on the licensing and roll-out of a Canadian air-to-ground network, which will make Gogo 
available in Canada and facilitate Air Canada's future fleet-wide deployment. Talks between Transport Canada, 
Industry Canada and the airline have been fruitful, reveals Air Canada senior director of product design Louise 
McKenven. "Nobody has an air-to-ground [licence] in Canada. They need an interested party. I don't know who the 
Canadian government will license it to," says McKenven.
Air Canada is also keen to work with Aircell to offer connectivity on overseas flights. This will require Aircell to either 
develop its own satellite-based solution or partner with another such provider. "We've tested some antennas in 
Europe. It's still not a clear picture when technology will be the right size, the right weight and offer the right 
accuracy for pinpointing to satellites," says Aircell senior vice-president airline solutions Fran Phillips.
Mexico also has a spectrum set aside for ATG. "We need to work with a partner and build a network there, too," 
says Phillips.
Even with clear challenges ahead, the in-flight entertainment and communications industry is certain that some of 
the biggest hurdles to entry - scepticism about reliability and passenger take-up - is quickly diminishing.
"The AeroMobile service has been used by many thousands of customers around the world since it launched with 
Emirates in March and, as we and Emirates expected, there has not been a single negative incident surrounding it," 
says AeroMobile chief executive Bjorn-Taale Sandberg.

Liverpool's John Lennon Airport is one of the oldest in Britain, celebrating its 75th birthday this year, writes Andrew 
Bounds.
However, the operation at Speke, south of Liverpool, really took off in 1997 when Peel Holdings, the north-west-
based property and transport company, acquired a 76 per cent majority shareholding from British Aerospace.
In 2001 it bought the remaining shares from the five Merseyside local authorities.
Peel has invested £100m since then, building a new terminal. Passenger numbers have increased eightfold, with 
5.5m passengers in 2007.
It is now the 12th biggest airport in the country and one of the fastest growing.
There are scheduled services to 69 short-haul destinations as well as holiday charter flights. EasyJet and Ryanair, 
the budget airlines, have bases there.
Peel owns vast tracts of flat land near the airport for future development, especially in freight traffic. It also owns 
ports and the Manchester Ship Canal nearby.

It's September, the TV is again showing queues of disgruntled voters, ministers are issuing calming statements. 
Never mind that some of the queues are in Heraklion, Dalaman, Tenerife and Palma, is this is another case for 
government aid?
Let's hope not. Transport secretary Ruth Kelly's reaction to the XL collapse was clear enough: "The government 
stands ready to provide the CAA with operational assistance should they need it." (Lombard's emphasis.) That said, 
the reformed levy-based system for financing Atol - which protects customers who buy their air holidays and flights 
through tour operators - is not even six months old. The protection afforded to clients of XL - which owned air 
holiday companies (covered), a web-bookable airline (not covered), and a direct holiday website (not covered) - 
looks patchy.
Insurers - which provided bonds for the old Atol system and lobbied against levies - are in an I-told-you-so mood. 
Big tour operators believe the XL affair may reinforce the case for extending the new £1-a-head levy to airlines. 
That would put holiday companies on the hook if another budget carrier failed, but the burden of paying to repatriate 
passengers - whether booked direct or through tour operators - would be shared with the likes of EasyJet, Ryanair 
and British Airways. You can guess what they think about the idea.
This is all oddly reminiscent of British banks' grumpiness at the idea they might pre-fund a new deposit insurance 
scheme in the wake of Northern Rock. The government has backed off on that, while reserving the right to 
introduce pre-funding later. That means the taxpayer would take the first hit if another bank failed.
That's not the case with Atol - and thank goodness. In the event of a shortfall, the Civil Aviation Authority can call on 
back-up lines of credit (coincidentally provided by Barclays, one of XL's lenders) and insurance.
The XL affair may well prompt some additional thinking about whether such schemes are sufficient. But despite the 
wails of marooned passengers, Ms Kelly should stick to her pledge and keep the taxpayers' wallet safely in her 
pocket.

After three straight days of falls on the Dublin shares market, bargain hunters moved in to help push the index out 
of the red.
By midday, the ISEQ was up 48.77 points to 4,358.52.
Investors put the shaky future of US investment banking giant, Lehman Brothers behind them and focussed on 
issues closer to home.
Despite a sharp increase in car sales as new VRT rules came in to effect in July, retail sales continued to slump, 
hitting a ten-year low, the latest data from the CSO shows. The volume of retail sales in July fell by 3.5pc compared 
to the same month last year. There was a monthly increase of 2.3pc but this was mainly down to a surge in car 
sales. If car sales are excluded, there was an annual decrease of 5.2pc and the monthly change was down by 
1.7pc, the CSO said. Davy Research decided to take a glass-half-full approach to the numbers, saying that, finally, 
the retail sales represented a positive data point in Ireland. Other economists and analysts were not so positive, 
with Austin hughes of IIB Bank saying that consumers and businesses are taking tough decisions to allow them to 
get through the downturn. "In the near term, this implies weaker activity and employment," he said. Banks were the 
biggest fallers of this week and were the main gainers from bargain hunting this morning. AIB shares gained by 5c 
to E7.90, Bank of Ireland was up 8c to E5.17, Anglo Irish climbed 8c to E5.15 and Irish Life and Permanent jumped 
by 16c to E6.71. Another airline bit the dust yesterday with XL Leisure Group, operator of XL airlines, which flies to 
50 destinations, mainly in the Mediterranean, and the UK's third-largest package holiday group, has gone into 
administration. Analysts have warned that the jump in oil prices would bring about major casualties in the sector but 
said that Ireland's Ryanair and Aer Lingus would weather the storm better than most. Shares in Ryanair gained 4c 
to E2.75 and Aer Lingus rose by 5c to E1.58. Elsewhere, shares in insulations group, Kingspan, gained by 5c to 
E7.50. Around 35pc of Kingspan's overall end-market revenues are from new non-residential build in the UK, 
ISEQ rises on bargain hunting ISEQ Up
making it (for now) the group's most important end-market. The value of new private industrial orders was down 
37pc year-on-year in Britain in July and new private commercial orders fell 17pc. "Commercial is over 85pc of both 
so combined the orders were down 20pc on July 2007. If we take the May to July quarter, orders were actually 
down 35pc on the same quarter in 2007. This gives some indication of the macro pressures Kingspan is facing in 
what remains its anchor market," said Flor O'Donoghue of Davy's. Shares in insurer, FBD, were down 1c to E14.00. 
According to CPI data, motor insurance rates continued their marginal increase, up 0.1pc month-on-month for 
August. That makes seven consecutive months without further rate declines, and a cumulative gain of 1.7pc in that 
time.

After three straight days of falls on the Dublin shares market, bargain hunters moved in to help push the index out 
of the red.
By midday, the ISEQ was up 48.77 points to 4,358.52.
Investors put the shaky future of US investment banking giant, Lehman Brothers behind them and focussed on 
issues closer to home.
Despite a sharp increase in car sales as new VRT rules came in to effect in July, retail sales continued to slump, 
hitting a ten-year low, the latest data from the CSO shows. The volume of retail sales in July fell by 3.5pc compared 
to the same month last year. There was a monthly increase of 2.3pc but this was mainly down to a surge in car 
sales. If car sales are excluded, there was an annual decrease of 5.2pc and the monthly change was down by 
1.7pc, the CSO said. Davy Research decided to take a glass-half-full approach to the numbers, saying that, finally, 
the retail sales represented a positive data point in Ireland. Other economists and analysts were not so positive, 
with Austin hughes of IIB Bank saying that consumers and businesses are taking tough decisions to allow them to 
get through the downturn. "In the near term, this implies weaker activity and employment," he said. Banks were the 
biggest fallers of this week and were the main gainers from bargain hunting this morning. AIB shares gained by 5c 
to E7.90, Bank of Ireland was up 8c to E5.17, Anglo Irish climbed 8c to E5.15 and Irish Life and Permanent jumped 
by 16c to E6.71. Another airline bit the dust yesterday with XL Leisure Group, operator of XL airlines, which flies to 
50 destinations, mainly in the Mediterranean, and the UK's third-largest package holiday group, has gone into 
administration. Analysts have warned that the jump in oil prices would bring about major casualties in the sector but 
said that Ireland's Ryanair and Aer Lingus would weather the storm better than most. Shares in Ryanair gained 4c 
to E2.75 and Aer Lingus rose by 5c to E1.58. Elsewhere, shares in insulations group, Kingspan, gained by 5c to 
E7.50. Around 35pc of Kingspan's overall end-market revenues are from new non-residential build in the UK,

making it (for now) the group's most important end-market. The value of new private industrial orders was down 
37pc year-on-year in Britain in July and new private commercial orders fell 17pc. "Commercial is over 85pc of both 
so combined the orders were down 20pc on July 2007. If we take the May to July quarter, orders were actually 
down 35pc on the same quarter in 2007. This gives some indication of the macro pressures Kingspan is facing in 
what remains its anchor market," said Flor O'Donoghue of Davy's. Shares in insurer, FBD, were down 1c to E14.00. 
According to CPI data, motor insurance rates continued their marginal increase, up 0.1pc month-on-month for 
August. That makes seven consecutive months without further rate declines, and a cumulative gain of 1.7pc in that 
time.

Short-haul service to challenge Alitalia
Body
Lufthansa is moving aggressively into the north Italian market to take advantage of the parlous state of Alitalia.
The heavily loss-making Italian airline was last night locked in talks with the government, trades unions and 
potential investors about the terms for a last-ditch rescue, as its operations were hit again by cancellations and 
industrial action.
The German flag-carrier said it was planning to base six Airbus A319 short-haul jets at Milan's Malpensa airport to 
launch a network of direct point-to-point services between Milan and leading European cities.
The move is the first by the German group to establish a base outside its national market to serve other countries, 
rather than to feed passenger traffic into its main hubs at Frankfurt and Munich.
Lufthansa said it would begin flights in February from Malpensa to Barcelona, Brussels, Budapest, Bucharest, 
Madrid and Paris. It was planning to add flights from Milan to London and Lisbon from the summer season next 
year.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt, a director of Lufthansa's passenger airline division, said the group would offer Italian customers 
a "reliable" service from Milan. "The catchment area around Milan Malpensa stretches to the south of Switzerland 
and economically is one of the most important regions in Europe," he said.
Lufthansa said the Milan-based aircraft would be operated by its Italian subsidiary Air Dolomiti, which hitherto has 
largely acted as a feeder airline into the group's Munich hub.
The German group has enlarged its ambitions significantly from its previous plan to move into Malpensa with a 
number of locally-based Embraer regional jets.
Lufthansa plans network from Milan
As the Alitalia operation shrinks amid restructuring and mounting losses, several of Europe's strongest carriers 
including Air France-KLM, EasyJet and Ryanair are rapidly increasing their operations in Italy to take advantage of 
the vacuum.
EasyJet, the UK low-cost carrier, which opened a base at Milan Malpensa in March 2006, is increasing its presence 
from 11 to 15 Airbus A319s by the end of the year.
Its Milan network already includes several domestic Italian routes, but it recently announced it would begin a four 
times daily service between Malpensa and Rome Fiumicino from November, challenging the Italian carriers Alitalia 
and Air One on the biggest and most lucrative domestic Italian air route.
Ryanair, the leading European low-cost carrier, which already has three operating bases in Italy at Rome Ciampino, 
Pisa and Milan Bergamo, recently ann-ounced plans to add two more at Bologna and Forli.
The Irish carrier will start flying seven routes into Bologna from the end of October. It is establishing the operating 
base at the airport in June 2010 with two aircraft, rising to five by 2012, when it forecasts it will be handling 25 
routes and 2m passengers through the city. A smaller base, with only one aircraft, will be established at nearby Forli 
next March.

Body
Once again, it was the banking sector that pushed the Dublin shares market sharply lower with the Irish economic 
situation and the global credit crunch firmly back on the agenda for investors.
The index dropped by 88.43 points to 4,309.75.
At the end of trading, the ISEQ ended up almost back where it was before the Fannie Mae/ Freddie Mac rescue-
bounce on Monday.
Lehman's revelation of a further USD7.8bn in credit-related write-downs in the last quarter (bringing its cumulative 
write-downs to over USD15bn), accompanied by a 'survival' plan involving the sale of its asset management unit 
and the spin-off of commercial real estate assets into a 'bad bank', prompted renewed jitters in markets. Irish banks 
led the way down as the Fitch report on Irish Nationwide put the focus firmly back on the key issue facing the Irish 
sector, namely the potential damage to commercial property loan books that a rapidly weakening Irish economy can 
cause, said Davy's Emer Lang. Shares in AIB fell by 25c to E7.85, Bank of Ireland dropped by 43c to E5.09, Anglo 
Irish declined by 29c to E5.07 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 25c to E6.55. Elsewhere, Fyffes reported a 
doubling of profits for the first half of the year but again warned about its full year prospects. The first six months of 
the year are traditionally stronger for the company, whose shares fell by 2c to E0.33. Davy's Stephen Furlong has 
been assessing the effect in the declining price of oil on Ryanair's revenues and profit prospects. "Clearly, the fall in 
the oil price provides huge leverage to the numbers. Every USD1 change in the oil price impacts the full year 2010 
figure by a net E11.6m but affects the 2009 figure by only E2.5m due to hedging," he said. However, a deteriorating 
yield environment can wipe out oil gains - each 1pc change in yields affects net income by E25m. Remember that

European shares skidded lower for a second session yesterday led by banking stocks after US investment bank 
Lehman Brothers announced an estimated net third-quarter loss of $3.9bn and a restructuring.
Banks pared their losses in late trade after Wall Street ticked slightly higher, but still ended sharply lower, pushing 
the FTSE Eurofirst 300 down 0.6 per cent to 1,148.23.
Irish banks topped the losers list with Allied Irish Banks  down 7.4 per cent to EUR8.1, Bank of Ireland falling 6.4 
per cent to EUR5.52 and Anglo Irish Banks losing 5.4 per cent to EUR5.39.
In France, BNP Paribas lost 2.1 per cent to EUR63.66, Crédit Agricole  slid 4.8 per cent to EUR14.05 and 
Société Générale  fell 4.1 per cent to EUR65.68.
Meanwhile, Santander shares dipped 3.2 per cent to EUR11.24 on rumours that the Spanish bank was considering 
a joint bid for Deutsche Postbank with Deutsche Bank.
Deutsche Bank  slipped 1.6 per cent to EUR61 and Deutsche Postbank  advanced 4.1 per cent to EUR46.55 
after Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank said a takeover of Postbank would "fit" his strategy. 
There was also talk in the market that Deutsche could buy a stake in Postbank by Friday.
Oil prices ticked higher in early trade after a surprise announcement from Opec that it would cut output slightly, 
before slipping back later in the session.
The news weighed on the personal goods sector and hit travel companies. Air France-KLM gave up much of 
Tuesday's gains falling 1 per cent to EUR17.69. Budget carrier Ryanair  slid 1.8 per cent to EUR2.75.
Drug maker Sanofi-Aventis  rose 7.2 per cent to EUR50.89 after it appointed Chris Viehbacher, head of North

European shares skidded lower for a second session yesterday, led by banking stocks after US investment bank 
Lehman Brothers announced an estimated net third-quarter loss of $3.9bn and a comprehensive restructuring.
Banks pared their losses in late trade after Wall Street ticked slightly higher, but still ended sharply lower, pushing

Irish banks topped the losers list with Allied Irish Banks  down 7.4 per cent to EUR8.1, Bank of Ireland falling 6.4

Deutsche Lufthansa  lost 0.5 per cent to EUR15.12.
A fall in the oil price would not necessarily provide relief for airline companies, analysts said.
Bourses slide for second day running
"You can't ignore the strength of the US dollar, which mitigates or negates the falling fuel cost. And if fear of 
demand weakness is pushing commodity prices down, this will be bad for airlines," said Tim Marshall, an analyst at 
UBS.
Mr Marshall favours airlines where "elasticity of demand is lowest", such as those concentrated on long-haul and 
premium routes. Highlights include Lufthansa and Iberia. Iberia fell 0.9 per cent to EUR2.11.
Fears of a slowdown in consumer spending hit luxury goods retailers. Richemont slipped 7.7 per cent to SFr59.65 
as it said it would suffer from a slowdown in the US. Swatch Group,  the watch maker, lost 7.5 per cent to SFr248.
In the travel sector, Accor , the French hotel operator, lost 0.9 per cent to EUR44.09 after reports that it would raise 
its stake in Polish hotel group Orbis to 50 per cent.
There were some bright spots, however. Finnish paper makers defied the gloom with Stora Enso up 5.7 per cent to 
EUR8 and UPM-Kymmene up 4.7 per cent to EUR12.78. Both companies unveiled large job cuts and a 
restructuring plan to cope with an increase in Russian wood duties and falling demand.
Drug maker Sanofi-Aventis  rose 7.2 per cent to EUR50.89 after it appointed Chris Viehbacher, head of North 
American operations at GlaxoSmithKline, to replace Gerard Le Fur, the current chief executive.
"Given that Sanofi has been in transition from a founder-led entrepreneurial group to diverse management-led 
organisation, we believe the replacement will bring new blood and positive drive," said S&P Equity Analyst Sho 
Matsubara.
Elsewhere in the pharmaceuticals sector, Novartis added 1.8 per cent to SFr60.90 after it reported promising 
developments in research on its meningitis B vaccine.

Body
Employers have warned that future investment by multi-national companies could disappear with many job losses if 
they were forced to recognise unions.
IBEC director general Turlough O'Sullivan was speaking as he arrived for the second day of pay talks at 
Government Buildings.
Mr O'Sullivan said that employers had told anyone who would listen for some time that they could not concede 
anything remotely approaching statutory union recognition.
He said the current position, where companies were not obliged to negotiate, with unions was 'the only competitive

Ryanair delays new routes due to Boeing strike
Ryanair delays new routes due to Boeing strike

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has delayed 11 new routes blaming a machinist strike at planemaker Boeing which 
has caused the indefinite delay of two new aircraft.
The company said on Tuesday the launch of new routes between Scottish capital Edinburgh and a range of 
destinations from Bournemouth in the UK to Lodz in Poland would be delayed by six weeks to November 5.
Deputy Chief Executive Michael Cawley said two new 737-800 planes had been ordered to fly on these routes, but 
would not arrive on time due to the Boeing strike.
'Passengers who were booked to travel on our new routes during this initial six week period will be refunded over 
the next seven days,' he said in a statement.
The strike by 27,000 Boeing machinists threatens to cost the world's top-selling planemaker $100 million a day and 
affect suppliers around the globe. Ryanair is among the first to announce disruption, but more may follow 
depending on the length of the strike, which is into its fourth day.
A Ryanair spokesman said the airline was currently reviewing how the strike would affect other deliveries. New 
routes set to be launched later this year include Liverpool in the UK to Paris, and London Stansted to Agadir, in 
Morocco.
He added the group could launch the Edinburgh routes in November regardless of how the strike develops because 
the firm was freeing up aircraft by closing routes for the winter.

The Machinists union has a $140 million strike fund and can sustain support for striking Boeing Co. production 
workers for five or six months, President Tom Buffenbarger said Tuesday.
Speaking from the convention of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in Orlando, 
Fla., Buffenbarger said support for the strike has been unwavering among delegates, even from local Machinists 
unions of airlines and other hard-hit sectors.
"This issue has united the convention," Buffenbarger said. The gathering takes place every four years.
Similarly, Marc Blondin, chief negotiator in contract talks covering 27,000 riveters, electricians, mechanics, painters 
and other hourly workers, said the strikers are prepared and resolved to stay out "as long as it takes" a mantra on 
picket lines to get an offer they're willing to accept.
On Sept. 3 union members voted 80 percent to reject a three-year package estimated by Boeing at $34,000 in 
average gains per worker bonuses averaging $6,400, raises averaging 11 percent, pension increases and a 3 
percent cost-of-living boost. They voted by 87 percent to strike.
The walkout began Saturday morning after a 48-hour contract extension in which a federal mediator tried without 
success to break the impasse.
Starting three weeks into the walkout, union members are entitled to $150 a week in strike pay. Average pay at 
Boeing is more than seven times that amount, although about 5,000 of the most recently hired employees get less 
than $32,000 a year.
"That fund gets replenished every month from union members who are not on strike," although less will be coming 
in than going out, Blondin said.
In the first impact on air travel, RyanAir announced that the strike had resulted in a six-week delay in opening a new 
hub from Edinburgh, Scotland, with service to 11 European destinations. The opening has been pushed back to 
Nov. 5, when aircraft from its existing fleet will be available, deputy chief executive Michael Cawley said.

Also on Tuesday, Triumph Composite Systems Inc. announced plans to lay off indefinitely at least 220 of the 550 
workers at its Spokane plant, which produces air control ducts and composite floors for Boeing and other aircraft. 
Another 15 percent to 20 percent of the workers face layoffs if the strike runs past Sept. 21, personnel director 
Michael Schelstrate said.
Another former Boeing operation that now supplies parts for the company, Spirit AeroSystems Inc. of Wichita, Kan., 
announced Monday that weekly hours will be reduced for employees involved in making certain products for 
Boeing.

Ryanair said Tuesday that a strike at Boeing Co. has forced it to delay the launch of new flight routes from 
Edinburgh, Scotland, by six weeks.
The Irish airline said Boeing is unable to deliver the new 737 aircraft the carrier needs to operate its new routes 
from Edinburgh to various European destinations.
Ryanair's deputy chief executive Michael Cawley said the airline would be able to run the new routes with aircraft 
from its existing fleet from November 5, six weeks later than it had planned. It will refund passengers who are due 
to travel before that date.
Ryanair Holdings PLC is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the 737 aircraft and flies an all-737 fleet.
Boeing's commercial aircraft assembly plants have been shuttered since its machinists union went on strike 
Saturday following the collapse of contract negotiations. The union represents 27,000 hourly production workers, 
including 25,000 in the greater Seattle area.
Boeing spokesman Tim Healy said: "Certainly we recognize that we're going to be missing deliveries, we're going to 
be unable to fulfill our commitments, and we deeply regret the inconvenience to our customers."

Ryanair Holdings Plc. said it has won the right Tuesday to challenge the award of the Public Service Obligation 
(PSO) subsidy on the Knock - Dublin route to Aer Arann.
The European low-cost airline said it is seeking an explanation of why its offer of a smaller subsidy, lower fares and 
triple the passenger numbers for the Knock route was rejected in favour of Aer Arann's larger subsidy, higher fares 
and fewer passenger numbers.
The High Court in Ireland has granted Ryanair's application for a judicial review of the decision of the Department of 
Transport following the unlawful award of a PSO contract for the Dublin to Knock route to Aer Arann, after Cityjet 
said it would not serve the route.

Highlight: Regional carrier's profits rise 14%
Airline makes more use of turboprops
Body
Flybe, one of Europe's leading regional airlines, increased pre-tax profits 14 per cent during its first quarter from 
April to June in contrast to the declines reported by many carriers around the world.
The leading UK domestic airline has benefited from its successful March 2007 takeover and restructuring of BA 
Connect, the previously lossmaking regional airline subsidiary of British Airways, as well as heavy investment in 
new aircraft.
As a result of the deal, BA, which provided £143m of funding to support the disposal of BA Connect, holds a 15 per 
cent stake in Flybe.
BA is aiming to sell the Flybe holding as part of an eventual initial public offering of the airline.
The regional airline, which was forced to delay its earlier IPO plan in order to take advantage of the opportunity to 
acquire BA Connect, was still targeting a flotation when financial market conditions improved, said Jim French, 
chairman and chief executive.
It has appointed Dresdner Kleinwort and Merrill Lynch as financial advisers.
Flybe is transferring much of its flying to the fuel-efficient Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft, which provides some 
protection from record oil prices. As a result, fuel accounts for a lower share of costs at Flybe than at most of its 
rivals.
While airlines with contrasting business models such as BA, a legacy, full- service network carrier, and Ryanair, 
Europe's leading low-cost carrier, reported falls in profits under the burden of fuel costs, Flybe said its first-quarter 
profits had risen from £10.7m to £12.2m.
Flybe gains as surging fuel costs hurt rivals
First-quarter revenues increased 13.7 per cent from £136m to £155m and passenger numbers rose 18 per cent to 
2m.
The group maintained a 7.9 per cent pre-tax profit margin in spite of a 60 per cent increase in fuel costs year-on-
year in the quarter to £32.7m.
For the financial year to the end of March, the first 12 months of the enlarged business, Flybe said profit had more 
than doubled from £15.3m to £35.4m on an underlying basis before integration and restructuring costs. Revenues 
rose 46 per cent from £368m to £536m.
The operating profit margin increased from 4.8 to 7.1 per cent with the pre-tax margin increasing from 4.2 to 6.6 per 
cent.
Including heavy integration and restructuring costs in the previous financial year Flybe achieved a turnround from a 
reported pre-tax loss for 2006-07 of £16.2m (including the heavy losses at BA Connect) to a profit of £30.4m last 
year.

Highlight: News Analysis
Flybe has found itself a comfortable niche by avoiding confrontation with bigger operators and their crowds, writes 
Kevin Done
Body
Jim French is a rare sight in today's troubled airline industry - an aviation executive with a relaxed smile.
While many of his rivals are reporting plunging profits, losses or outright bankruptcy, Mr French, chairman and chief 
executive of Flybe, the leading UK domestic airline and one of Europe's biggest regional carriers, yesterday 
announced a 14 per cent rise in first-quarter profits in spite of a 60 per cent increase in its fuel bill.
By taking over BA Connect 18 months ago, Mr French has seized the opportunity to create a single, strong UK 
regional airline out of the motley collection of small carriers acquired by British Airways over the years but never 
properly rationalised and starved of adequate investment.
Flybe has moved quickly to garner the originally estimated cost savings and revenue gains of more than £40m a 
year, while ending BA Connect's £40m annual loss.
It took out 21 per cent of the combined capacity, resulting in almost 500 redundancies. It closed the BA Connect 
operating base at Bristol airport, where the routes were making heavy losses; shut the BA Connect engineering 
base on the Isle of Man; and abandoned the BA Connect headquarters operation in Manchester.
However, in the process it has expanded by about 50 per cent and has created a business that is proving 
surprisingly resilient in the current tough environment.
Flybe has used many features of the low-cost models pioneered by Ryanair and EasyJet but stayed in a regional 
niche just below the radar screens of the big no-frills operators. It has only a modest presence in the overcrowded 
south-east and has developed as one of the biggest operators in the regions with key bases in Southampton, 
Exeter, Birmingham and Manchester as well as in Jersey, Belfast, Edinburgh and Glasgow. It also has growing 
bases in Aberdeen, Inverness and Newcastle.
Regional upstart flew below the radar
It abandoned a dangerous flirtation two years ago with the idea of going head-to-head with the low-cost carriers on 
key leisure routes and settled on the more defensible niche of domestic routes round the UK regions.
It added continental European city routes to and from these regions through the BA Connect takeover, and has also 
developed its own specialisation of routes linking the UK with the regional French destinations beloved of UK 
second home owners.
The UK domestic network accounts for 73 per cent of Flybe seats, with European city routes making up 20 per cent 
and European leisure routes only 7 per cent.
Crucially - in particular for coping with the subsequent hugely damaging surge in oil prices - Flybe chose to 
underpin the transformation strategy with ambitious volumes of new aircraft orders. It is investing $2bn (£1.1bn) in 
60 78-seat Bombardier Q400 turboprops and 14 118-seat Embaer 195 jets from Brazil.
When the BA Connect deal emerged in late 2006 the stream of new aircraft was already flowing and Flybe could 
deploy many of the aircraft on former BA routes rather than build up expensive new routes itself.
Key to the BA deal was securing sufficient - £143m - financing from the global carrier to cushion the transition and 
to finance the disposal of the BA Connect fleet, which was wrongly sized and expensive to operate. The fleet 
transformation will be complete in a year.
Fuel is still only accounting for 23 per cent of Flybe total costs compared with about 40 per cent at many other 
carriers, and passengers have not been deterred by the switch to turboprops.

The court has agreed to allow the low fares airline to challenge the award of a "public service obligation" subsidy for

The regional airline was awarded a contract by the Department of Transport to fly the route after another airline 
CityJet pulled out.
Ryanair claims that it had offered to serve the route for a much lower price to the taxpayer and with over three times

The stories of the Ryanair jet that plunged several thousand feet and the British Airways aircraft that crash-landed 
at Heathrow after ice blocked its fuel supply prompt a memory of a near miss. Most people have their own scare 
stories. A few years ago I was on a BA flight coming in to land at Warsaw when there was a loud creaking, as if a 
wing was about to break off. Then the plane overshot the runway and began to climb again. After a couple of 
minutes the pilot announced: "I'm sorry about that. They gave us a rather narrow angle of approach."

Shares on the Dublin market surged by well over 7pc this morning on hopes that the decision by the US 
government to come to the rescue of mortgage firms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, will mark the beginning of the

By midday, the ISEQ was up 305.83 points to 4,588.15 - a rise of 7.14pc.
Shares across Europe and Asia stormed ahead in morning trade after Sunday's announcement from the US.
The US government launched what could be the country's biggest federal bail-out in a bid to support the US 
housing market and ward off more global financial market turbulence. Officials were concerned about mounting 
losses at the two companies, which own or guarantee almost half of the country's USD12 trillion in outstanding 
home mortgage debt. The losses threatened to undermine the two companies at a time other sources of housing 
finance have largely run dry. US President George Bush said the action was necessary because the troubles at 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac posed 'an unacceptable risk to the broader financial system and our economy'. 'Our 
economy and our markets will not recover until the bulk of this housing correction is behind us,' US Treasury 
Secretary Henry Paulson said at a news conference yesterday. 'Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are critical to turning 
the corner on housing,' he added. The two companies, which are publicly traded but also serve a US government 
mission to support housing, were put in a conservatorship. This allows their shares to keep trading but puts 
common shareholders last in any claims. Last week, global equities endured their worst week since September 
2001. US labour market data were much weaker than expected on consecutive days, Thursday and Friday. "While 
this underlines the ongoing impact of the credit crunch, the move should take a lot of uncertainty out of the market," 
said Davy's Emer Lang. Shares in AIB jumped by nearly 13pc or E1.01 to E8.90, Bank of Ireland climbed by 11pc

Irish airlines made strong gains despite a spike in crude prices, the collapse of charter airline, Futura Gael and

that the ABC August circulation numbers show broadly similar trends of modestly falling circulation, with the

Shares on the Dublin market surged by well over 6pc on hopes that the decision by the US government to come to 
the rescue of mortgage firms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, will mark the beginning of the end of the credit crunch.
The index surged by 286.73 points to 4,569.05.
Shares across Europe powered ahead with banking stocks leading the charge and, in early trading on Wall St, the 
Dow Jones 3pc and the Nasdaq rose by just over 2pc.
The rebound came after the US government launched what could be the country's biggest federal bailout in a bid to 
support the US housing market and ward off more global financial market turbulence. Officials were concerned 
about mounting losses at the two companies, which own or guarantee almost half of the country's USD12 trillion in 
outstanding home mortgage debt. The losses threatened to undermine the two companies at a time other sources 
of housing finance have largely dried up. US President Bush said the action was necessary because the troubles at

Sterling drop hits Irish firms hard

Currency fluctuations are damaging stocks, writes Samantha McCaughren, Business Correspondent.
Ireland's publicly-quoted companies have already taken a hammering in recent months and any additional 
weakness in sterling is a further unwelcome headwind for several stocks.
With sterling reaching all time lows last week, going over 81p against the euro, many companies are bracing 
themselves for further falls in the currency. Among those with high sterling exposure are Kingspan, DCC, Abbey 
and C&C and, in total, 30 per cent of the ISEQ's earnings are in sterling.
One stock market insider said that, while sterling had yet to reach worryingly levels, the fact that it had broken 
through the 80p mark was psychologically significant. While the currency has been weakening throughout the year, 
it has stayed below the 80p barrier until recent days. Some technical currency analysts believe it is heading for 
83/84p against the euro now.
Despite the potential of further falls in sterling, it has not yet prompted a re-evaluation of forecasts, according to 
analysts.
Bloxham analyst Ross McEvoy said: ''At present we're not too concerned, as you have to look at what you believe 
the average rate will be for a six month period. However if sterling was to reach 83p or 84p against the euro in the 
coming week, further downgrades are likely.
''The euro/sterling rate averaged 0.775 for the first half of the year and we're currently averaging 0.795 for the 
second half, which is already forecast into most models," he said.
The current erosion of sterling is also in contrast to its rapid fall in value over last 2007 and early 2008. ''The last 
time around, it was the pace of the move in the euro/sterling rate which caught investors by surprise," said McEvoy.
Sterling drop hits Irish firms hard
Profit warnings were hurried out before stockbrokers had time to revise down their forecasts. However, this time 
around the market may be better prepared and a dramatic swing is less likely.
Some companies will have to watch the currency fluctuations very closely, however. Around 75 per cent of 
Greencore's profits are in sterling, which means any additional weakness in the currency puts pressure on their 
bottom line when earnings are translated back into euro.
For Kingspan and DCC, 58 per cent of their profits are in sterling. Over half of Ryanair's profits are exposed to 
sterling fluctuations. For Grafton it is 51 per cent of profits and for McInerney, 46 per cent.
Bookmaker Paddy Power recently reported a  5 million hit due to the weakening of sterling and would face a further 
hit if the currency continues to slide.
Cider maker C&C has so far been protected from the sterling dip due to favourable hedging. However, this sterling 
deal will end later this year and there will be another headache for the company, which has seen its Magners brand 
come under pressure in Britain.
One analyst commented that, while the sterling fall might be a concern for plcs, many were dealing with far more 
''alarming'' challenges in their businesses.
On the upside, several companies are getting an unexpected boost from the resurgence of the dollar against the 
euro. Among those which will benefit are CRH and Smurfit Kappa. The easing of oil prices is also offering some 
much needed respite to several quoted companies.

A group of Abu Dhabi investors agreed to buy Manchester City from Thaksin Shinawatra, the former Thai prime 
minister. Within hours of the deal, the new owners signed Robinho, the Brazilian forward, from Real Madrid for a 
reported £32.5m. The player had been sought by Roman Abramovich's Chelsea. The purchase by Abu Dhabi 
United Group for Development and Investment valued the club's equity and debt at £200m, according to a person 
familiar with the matter. Mr Shinawatra paid £81.6m for the club a year ago. American Airlines, British Airways and 
Spain's Iberia , which are seeking regulatory approval to forge a transcontinental venture, have challenged rivals' 
claims that the alliance would dominate important routes between the US and London. 
American, BA and Iberia aim to persuade US officials to grant their venture immunity from antitrust rules that limit 
their ability to co-ordinate schedules and fares, and to share revenue. The planned alliance drew fire from Virgin, 
BA's long-time rival. Dermot Mannion, chief executive of Aer Lingus, warned that the Irish airline must undertake 
"fundamental change" in order to minimise a "potential EUR100m [£82m] operating loss in 2009". Mr Mannion said 
Aer Lingus cannot afford the traditional protracted negotiations with its trade unions. Aer Lingus' results contrasted 
with those of Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, which reported a 19 per cent growth in passenger volumes. 
Underlying profits fell sharply, however, and the group said it may make a full-year loss for the first time since it was 
floated 11 years ago, citing falling air fares and surging fuel costs. Punch Taverns highlighted the uncertain outlook 
facing the pub industry after it scrapped its final dividend amid continuing weak sales in its managed and leased 
pubs. Giles Thorley, chief executive, said the credit squeeze made it uncertain whether Punch Taverns would be 
able to raise finance when it needed to repay a £295m convertible bond in December 2010. Greene King, however, 
said it was on track to meet its expectations for the current financial year in spite of weaker sales and rising costs, 
boosting shares in the pubs and brewing group. Greene King, whose brands include Old Speckled Hen and Abbot 
Ale, said sales in its pubs were down 1.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis in the first 16 weeks of its financial year to 
August 24.
The Week
Oil & Gas 
BP expressed its long-term commitment to its partnership with the Russian Alfa-Access-Renova group, after ending 
the acrimony over their TNK-BP joint venture. The agreement preserves 50-50 ownership but will lead to a float of 
20 per cent of the company. Many key details, including the appointment of a chief executive to replace Robert 
Dudley, are yet to be resolved. The long-running dispute had in part led Standard and Poor's, the ratings agency, to 
downgrade BP's long-term rating, but upgraded Royal Dutch Shell.
Electricity 
Electricité de France movedcloser to a deal to buy British Energy after talks with the nuclear generator made 
progress, according to people close to the situation. After British Energy rejected its offer in July, the French utility 
has boosted the potential pay-out under its alternative cash-and-paper bid, conditional on the UK company's 
performance.
Telecoms 
Cable and Wireless paved the way towards a possible break-up by offloading £1bn of pension liabilities. The 
purchase of an annuity policy by C&W's defined benefit pension fund trustees with Prudential is the largest UK 
transfer of retirement liabilities to date. C&W's pension trustees could still scupper a group restructuring if they 
feared it would jeopardise retirement benefits, but the Prudential transaction should ease such concerns.
Mining 
Xstrata has been given a deadline of October 2 by the Takeover Panel to make a bid for Lonmin or walk away. 
Earlier Lonmin , the platinum miner, had said there could be "significant synergies" in combining its operations with 
those of Xstrata, which is attempting a hostile £5bn takeover of the group. However, Lonmin said it would only 
consider talking to Xstrata about a deal if it raised its proposed offer of £33 a share, so that both sets of 
shareholders could share the benefits.
Banks 
Potential buyers are emerging for the British core of Dresdner Kleinwort , the investment banking franchise of 
Dresdner Bank, after the German group's recent acquisition by its rival Commerzbank. Collins Stewart , the 
stockbroker, is considering an approach for Dresdner Kleinwort's UK advisory, capital markets and equity trading 
businesses, people familiar with the matter said.
General Financial 
Philip Richards stepped down as chief executive of RAB Capital to focus on running the Aim-listed company's 
biggest hedge fund, saying it was "too onerous" to manage the company as well as the fund amid the market 
turmoil. Media The board of Informa  rejected its second offer in two years, saying the 450p approach by the 
private equity consortium led by Providence Equity Partners "significantly undervalued" the business information 
group that publishes Lloyd's List. The consortium, originally made up of Providence and Carlyle Group - and later 
joined by Blackstone - first approached Informa at the start of July with a 506p a share indicative proposal valued at 
£3.4bn. However, tumbling markets forced it to reduce the offer by almost 10 per cent, valuing Informa at closer to 
£3bn.
Support Services 
Babcock International signed a £1.5bn contract to train Britain's military engineers over the next 30 years. The deal 
will significantly boost Babcock's order book, which currently stands at more than £5bn. The company, together with 
its partner Carillion, will take over the provision of training, training support and infrastructure at the Royal School of 
Military Engineering. The contract, worth £3bn in total, will be delivered by Holdfast Training Services, a joint 
venture between the two companies.
The Week
Aerospace 
Qinetiq, the defence research group, won a 15-year contract from the Ministry of Defence to secure critical ship and 
submarine testing facilities in the UK. Under the £150m contract, called the Maritime Strategic Capabilities 
agreement, the two parties will commit to a significant investment in Qinetiq's facilities, in particular submarines.
Engineering 
Jarlway is to cancel its Aim listing at the end of the month as the Chinese concrete pumpmaker struggles to repay 
its debts in China. The withdrawal is a blow to London's junior market, which has made attracting foreign 
companies central to its growth, but has seen several of its listings begin to look elsewhere for liquidity. Jarlway said 
its financial situation had deteriorated significantly.
General Retailers 
Falling demand for electrical goods across Europe caused fresh pain at DSG International, with like-for-like sales 
dropping at the owner of PC World and Currys. UK group sales fell 7 per cent in the 16 weeks to August 23, while 
like-for-like sales at DSG's southern Europe division, which is being reviewed by the group's bankers, dropped 12 
per cent.
