Struggling regional airports, such as the now closed Galway Airport, could now qualify for State aid after the EU 
Commission today adopted new guidelines on how Governments can prop up failing airports.
State aid for investment in airport infrastructure is allowed if there is a genuine transport need and the public 
support is necessary to ensure the accessibility of a region. The new guidelines define maximum permissible aid 
intensities depending on the size of an airport, in order to ensure the right mix between public and private 
investment. The possibilities to grant aid are therefore higher for smaller airports than for larger ones, the EU 
Commission said this morning.
Operating aid to regional airports (with less than 3 million passengers a year) will be allowed for a transitional period 
of 10 years under certain conditions, in order to give airports time to adjust their business model. To receive 
operating aid, airports need to work out a business plan paving the way towards full coverage of operating costs at 
the end of the transitional period. As under the current market conditions, airports with an annual passenger traffic 
of below 700 000 may face increased difficulties in achieving full cost coverage during the transitional period, the 
guidelines include a special regime for those airports, with higher aid intensities and a reassessment of the situation 
after 5 years.
Start-up aid to airlines to launch a new air route is permitted provided it remains limited in time. The compatibility 
conditions for start-up aid to airlines have been streamlined and adapted to recent market developments. Europe's 
biggest airline, Ryanair, today welcomed the new guidelines. "All of Ryanair's arrangements with airports around 
Europe comply with the Market Economy Investor Principle (MEIP). The new State aid Guidelines reinstate the 
MEIP at the heart of the test for whether State aid exists in the arrangements between airports and airlines. Ryanair 
welcomes this clarification," a statement said.

Ryanair could nearly double its fleet size to 600 aircraft and carry 150m passengers a year by 2030, according to its 
deputy chief executive Michael Cawley.
In an interview today with the Irish Independent, Mr Cawley also said that despite the airline having appealed a 
ruling in the UK that it must reduce its stake in Aer Lingus to 5pc from nearly 30pc, the holding is no longer 
important to Ryanair.
The Michael O'Leary-led company agreed last year to buy 175 aircraft from Boeing, which Mr Cawley - who is also 
chief operating officer at the airline - described as a "very modest" order.
The first of those planes will be delivered in the autumn, and the order will boost Ryanair's fleet size to a little more 
than 430. The airline has a current target of carrying 110m passengers a year by 2019. The Irish Independent

How Morocco Is Prospering As A Tourist Destination

 As tourism declines in Egypt, Morocco has been making the most of its status as a safer destination in Muslim 
North Africa.
 On Tuesday, a Sinai-based extremist group warned all tourists to leave Egypt within days, or risk attacks. The 
terror group, called Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, is the same organization that claimed responsibility for the explosion of a 
South Korean tour bus near the Egyptian city of Taba on Sunday that killed four and injured 17.
 'The tourism sector remains the most affected by the political scene in Egypt,' Omneia Helmy, director of research 
at the Egyptian Center of Economic Studies, told International Business Times[1]. 
 Even before the recent attacks, tourist visits to Egypt dropped 31 percent to just 678,000 in 2013, according to 
CAPMAS, the state statistical agency.
 Meanwhile, more than 10.5 million tourists visited Morocco last year - up 7 percent since 2012, according to AFP.
 Last week, Lahcen Haddad, Morocco's tourism minister, told Bloomberg[2] that airlines and tour companies see 
the country as 'a secure destination.' 
 He noted that he's been speaking with British Airways, Lufthansa, Ryanair, EasyJet, Transavia and Air Berlin about 
organizing routes. Plus, he said direct flights to and from China should become a reality in 2015. 
 Despite the increased numbers, tourists are spending less in Morocco, thanks to a slow economy in Europe. In 
fact, tourism receipts fell 0.5 percent last year. But the country is still in a much better state than its neighbors and 
seem to be taking advantage of the situation.
 'In a region that has recently come to be associated with social upheaval and anemic growth, Morocco often stands 
out as an exception,' reads a World Bank report issued Jan. 24. The bank's data shows that tourism now accounts 
for 11 percent of the country's GDP and officials are also pursuing emerging sectors such as eco-tourism.

RYANAIR and EasyJet have been fined more than (EURO)1m for not being clear enough about the travel 
insurance they sell to Italian customers alongside flight bookings.
Italy's competition authority has imposed an (EURO)850,000 (£697,000) penalty on Ryanair and a (EURO)200,000 
fine for EasyJet for "unfair commercial practices".
The low-cost airlines failed to tell customers about the risks covered by the insurance policies and set excesses so 
high that they were sometimes more than the original cost of the ticket, the Autorita Garante della Concorrenza e 
del Mercato added.
Passengers who fail to board their flight have to get proof from the airline in order to claim on cancellation 
insurance. Ryanair charged customers (EURO)20 to obtain a certificate and EasyJet levied a (EURO)12 fee, which 
was slammed as unfair by the regulator as this confirmation "could be easily given to the insurance company 
without any burden to consumers".
The watchdog also criticised Ryanair's website for having the "do not need insurance" option lodged between the 
Netherlands and Norway on a drop-down menu entitled "select the country of residence". It said this set-up was 
"unfair, cumbersome and misleading".
The anti-trust body has given Ryanair 30 days to set out how it intends to make its optional flight cancellation 
insurance easier for consumers to understand.
Ryanair's fine was larger due to the scope of the breaches of Italy's consumer code and the fact that the airline has 
broken the code several times. It said EasyJet had already made efforts to fix its website.

"We note this ruling and while we disagree with its findings and have instructed our lawyers to appeal, we will be 
amending our website accordingly," said a Ryanair spokesperson yesterday.
EasyJet, which uses Allianz to provide its insurance, said it has remedied the issues raised and that it was 
considering its options.

Italy's antitrust watchdog, AGCM , has fined Ryanair and easyJet more than EUR1m for misleading customers over 
travel insurance, writes Jane Wild .
It said that the airlines' insurance policies had not given customers enough information to make informed choices. 
Their websites did not clearly explain what risks were covered, excess charges were disproportionately high and 
the fee attached to requesting a refund was greater than the cost of the insurance itself.
Ryanair was criticised for making the option to refuse insurance difficult to find. It was placed on a drop-down menu 
of countries, between the Netherlands and Norway.
Ryanair must pay a penalty of EUR850,000, while easyJet was fined the lesser sum of EUR200,000 because it had 
already amended its website. Ryanair said it disagreed with the decision and would appeal against it, but that it 
would alter its website.
EasyJet said it was "disappointed" by the decision. "All of the issues raised in the decision have already been 
remedied in consultation with the AGCM and our insurance partner Allianz." It added that it would review its options.

Iberia strikes deal with union to freeze pilots' pay; TRAVEL & LEISURE

Iberia has reached a deal with its pilots' union on pay and productivity that looks set to help the airline back on the 
road to profitability.
The Spanish flag carrier said yesterday it had agreed with Sepla, the union, to freeze pilots' pay until 2015.
After that, salary increases would be tied to the airline's profitability, International Airlines Group, its parent 
company, said.
A 4 per cent wage cut would be reversed in return for productivity improvements such as flying more hours, but an 
earlier 14 per cent cut would remain in place.
IAG said the deal would help it to cut costs and make Iberia more competitive and hailed a better relationship with 
Sepla after years of conflict.
Analysts said the deal, reached after months of talks, was likely to end the industrial relations disputes that have 
dogged Iberia's turnround efforts and could set a precedent for other workers such as cabin crew and ground staff.
Iberia has undergone a tough restructuring, with the loss of 3,100 jobs, and its weak performance pushed IAG into 
a pre-tax loss of EUR997m last year.

It had suffered from the Spanish economic crisis and tough competition in Europe from the likes of Ryanair, but also 
on its routes to South America.
Iberia, which merged with British Airways in 2011, has been turning more bullish; last year its second and third-
quarter results showed improvement and in November it lifted its profit target.
IAG's share price rose 2.9 per cent yesterday to 442p.

Body
Norwegian Air Shuttle has said that its long-distance subsidiary had formally received an operating license from the 
Irish Aviation Authority but with a pilots' organisation claiming safety dangers and calling it "a flag of convenience".
This clears the path for the budget carrier to seek approval in the United States for a plan to offer cut-rate flights 
across the Atlantic that has been fiercely opposed by airlines and pilots there and in Europe.
Airline and pilots unions on both sides of the Atlantic had called on Ireland to refuse a license that would allow the 
subsidiary, Norwegian Air International, to be based in the 28-member European Union. They argue that the 
carrier's business plan, which involves basing some of its pilots and crew in Thailand and hiring American flight 
attendants, gives the airline an unfair advantage.
Norwegian Air already operates flights to the United States and Thailand from Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo 
with jets registered in Ireland. The airline said that it had submitted its application to the United States Department 
of Transportation for a foreign permit for Norwegian Air International. Such an authorisation would allow it to add 
Los Angeles, Orlando, Florida and other destinations under the auspices of a 2007 agreement that liberalised air 
travel between the United States and the European Union. Norwegian Air, Europe's third-largest budget carrier, 
after Ryanair and easyJet, has rejected accusations that its choice of an Irish base is nothing more than a bid to 
skirt Norwegian labour laws that restrict the hiring of less expensive workers abroad. Norway is not a member of the 
European Union. The European Cockpit Association, a representative body for pilots, said it regret the Irish Aviation 
Authority (IAA) decision to grant a permanent operating license and Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) to Norwegian 
Air International - a long-haul subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle - which seeks to fly between Europe, Thailand 
and the USA. "With this, the IAA sets a harmful precedent allowing airlines to 'shop around' for lenient legislation, 
bypassing regulatory, tax and social obligations that their competitors have to comply with in their countries. It also

raises questions about the potential flight safety implications of NAI's deliberately complex business structure," it 
said. "The Irish Aviation Authority's decision will have serious safety and social repercussions. Competition in 
aviation is welcome but Norwegian's business model is a book example for a flag of convenience, opening the way 
to social dumping and undermining labour standards. This contravenes the EU-US Air Transport Agreement which 
contains distinct provisions against such practices," says Nico Voorbach, ECA President. "We therefore urge the 
EU Commission to take a firm stance to ensure the provisions of the EU-US Agreement are respected. For the 
same reason we call upon the US Department of Transport to refuse a foreign air carrier permit to NAI." Using the 
Irish AOC, the airline seeks to perform long-haul flights to the U.S. as an Irish airline, without ever touching Ireland - 
but benefitting from Ireland's favorable tax regime - while hiring pilots with Singaporean temporary contracts, basing 
them in Bangkok (Thailand), but allowing them (de facto) to live in Europe, where they will neither pay taxes nor 
social security. "Passenger safety is the other crucial issue, as we have severe concerns about the ability of the 
Irish authority to perform adequate safety oversight on such a complex and opaque company set-up" says Philip 
von Schoppenthau, ECA Secretary General. "NAI's business set up contains a similar mix of elements that 
contributed to the fatal Cork accident and its 'employment' model discourages an open incident reporting by crews 
hired on temporary contracts in Asia. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic must think carefully about the 
potential safety implications their decision might have."

Ryanair has mounted a challenge to a decision by the U.K. antitrust regulator ordering it to slash its stake in Aer

Ryanair is appealing the U.K. Competition Commission's August ruling on the grounds there is no basis in law for it 
have to have come to its decision, and that the procedure was flawed, David Pannick, a lawyer representing 
Ryanair said on the first day of the three-day hearing at the London Competition Appeals Tribunal, according to a

Ryanair's 29.8 percent holding in Aer Lingus, valued at about E249 million, affects Aer Lingus's policy and strategy, 
the Competition Commission said in a report published in August ordering the Dublin-based company to cut its 
stake in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair is appealing the regulator's decision on six grounds, Pannick said. Europe's largest low-cost carrier has 
done battle with competition authorities in Europe since it first bought Aer Lingus shares as part of a takeover bid in 
2006. Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary's most recent offer for the smaller rival was blocked in 
February 2013 by the European Union, which ruled it would increase fares and reduce choice.

Ryanair has mounted a challenge to a decision by the U.K. antitrust regulator ordering it to slash its stake in Aer 
Lingus Group Plc (AERL) to no more than 5pc.
Ryanair is appealing the U.K. Competition Commission's August ruling on the grounds there is no basis in law for it 
have to have come to its decision, and that the procedure was flawed, David Pannick, a lawyer representing 
Ryanair said on the first day of the three-day hearing at the London Competition Appeals Tribunal, according to a 
report on Bloomberg.
Ryanair's 29.8 percent holding in Aer Lingus, valued at about E249 million, affects Aer Lingus's policy and strategy, 
the Competition Commission said in a report published in August ordering the Dublin-based company to cut its 
stake in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair is appealing the regulator's decision on six grounds, Pannick said. Europe's largest low-cost carrier has 
done battle with competition authorities in Europe since it first bought Aer Lingus shares as part of a takeover bid in 
2006. Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary's most recent offer for the smaller rival was blocked in 
February 2013 by the European Union, which ruled it would increase fares and reduce choice.

Globehook, a new online recruitment site just launched by Margaret Townsend and Keith Sheehan and that has 
already booked some top-name clients, aims to shake up the industry at home and around the world.
Globehook.com is intent on revolutionising recruitment with a new Cloud based job site that promises accurate 
matches for employers with jobs and candidates seeking work.
The idea behind the site is to overcome the hurdles associated with 'crude and generic' online recruitment 
approaches for filling vacancies.
On average only 3pc of candidates hired are sourced from each of the top 3 recruitment sites (Indeed, Monster, 
Careerbuilder) and 2.9pc are sourced from social media (including LinkedIn) meaning that advertising jobs and 
searching for candidates on these websites is not hitting the sort of employers, despite the money and time being 
spent on them. "Having worked as both an employee and employer I know the disappointment of not hearing back 
when sending out CVs and the time consumption that is used when responding to job seekers. Globehook is a very 
simple tool which gives 100pc privacy, efficiency and is highly personalised. SMEs make up over 90pc of 
companies globally and it this area which we are focussing on. We have had large support from Enterprise Ireland 
and the Kerry Enterprise Board along with private investing and we are looking forward to building Globehook into a 
recruitment tool that will be used by businesses worldwide," said Ms Townsend. The duo created a site that 
ultimately took over a year to build, incorporating a unique matching algorithm an easy to use interface and 
management tools. The Globehook site was build on .Net and MS SQL platform by Continuum Technologies and is 
based on more than 10 elements including job type, location, qualifications and salary. Over E200,000 has been 
invested in the business to date, and has been given High Potential Startup status by Enterprise Ireland. Globehook 
went live in December and already Version 1, Ryanair, Ergo, TerminarFour, Central Bank of Ireland, Stream 
Ireland, EBay Europe are some of the companies signed up.

The ISEQ fell slightly this morning after last week's rebound as investors pocketed gains.

European shares inched higher, led by Nokia's gains after settling patent claims with rival HTC and on relief that

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, easyJet's founder and largest shareholder, is expected to vote against plans to award the 
chief executive Carolyn McCall a £6.4m pay package.
People close to Sir Stelios, whose family is the largest shareholder in the low-cost airline with a 36 per cent stake, 
said it is likely he will oppose the remuneration report at Thursday's AGM.
Sir Stelios, who founded the airline in 1995, has campaigned against excessive boardroom pay at the airline. Last 
year, he voted against Ms McCall's £5m pay package, saying she was "overpaid" .
In December, easyJet revealed that she was in line for pay of £6.4m for 2013 . This included a bonus of £1.2m and 
£4.6m under a long-term incentive plan, on top of her basic salary of £665,000. Chris Kennedy, chief financial 
officer, will receive £3.7m, including a bonus of £533,000 and £2.7m under the incentive plan, more than double 
that of last year.
Ms McCall's pay packet comes after a year in which the airline's profit soared 51 per cent to £478m and it 
announced a £175m special dividend to shareholders.
But her remuneration outstrips that of her peers. Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, took home EUR1.2m 
last year.

David Malanaphy has been group general manager of the O'Callaghan Hotel Group (OCH) since early 2012. The 
group has four hotels in Dublin, including the Mont Clare, the Davenport, the Alexander and the Stephen's Green 
Hotel. Overseas, it owns Gibraltar's Elliot Hotel and the Annapolis in Maryland in the US. The Mont Clare, OHC's 
first hotel, opened in 1990 and now employs 350 people.
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
I manage and direct the company's operations in Ireland and our two international properties. I am also responsible 
for strategy and development, working with the management team and the board of directors, to devise strategic 
plans and implement new processes and approaches to achieve our goals and objectives.
**What motivates you in your job?**
In hospitality, I get great satisfaction in delivering excellent customer care. I believe hotels should be welcoming 
customers as if they were coming into your own home. My job as a hotelier is to make the customer feel special and 
to make their life a little easier. I love people in general, so I am in the perfect industry. I enjoy working with, hiring, 
sharing and learning with my teams. Feeling valued also motivates me. I believe that, to get the best out of 
everyone on your team, they have to feel valued within an organisation.
**How would you describe your work style?**
I take a leadership approach and value flexibility. You have to be able to adapt to the audience and the situation 
you are dealing with.
**What is the most valuable professional lesson you have learned so far?**
Working Week
We all make mistakes, but the key is to ensure that you don't keep making the same mistake over and over again. I 
successfully opened two hotels during my career, which was a great learning curve for me. Starting a hotel from the 
ground up is no easy task, between hiring new recruits, training and then driving sales to ensure success.
**Whose career do you most admire and why?**
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary. I really admire the big risks he has taken throughout his career and how 
he is not afraid to stand over his comments, no matter what the backlash is. He has changed Ireland's aviation 
industry, making it much more competitive and attracting many more tourists into the country. Outside Ireland, I 
really admire Richard Branson for his mantra ''screw it, just do it. He has a great business brain and prioritises 
customer care and employee culture.
**What is the most valuable career advice you can offer others?**
Tap into the experience around you. When starting my career, I ensured I had a good network of people from the 
hospitality industry, as well as friends and family. This gave me encouragement and helped me focus on my goals 
and objectives. Do a job you love. If you are not happy in your role, you will not give it 100 per cent.
**In terms of doing business in Ireland, what do you think is the biggest challenge we face?**
I am a firm believer that, in business, realising your vision is all about having the right people on board. The single 
biggest challenge is finding the right staff, and ensuring they buy into this vision. I look at personalities and attitude 
first. I can train people to do a job, but I can't change someone's attitude. The key is to learn how to deal with 
different personalities, figure out what drives each individual team member and tailor your management 
accordingly.
**What is your ultimate professional goal at this point?**
Ultimately, I would like to lead a company and believe the lessons you learn in hospitality can be applied in a wide 
range of industries.

Scandinavian airline SAS plans to raise more than $600m from a preference share and convertible bond issue to 
shore up its balance sheet and modernise its ageing fleet.
SAS staved off looming bankruptcy in 2012 and posted its first annual profit since 2007 last year. But it is still 
struggling to compete amid weak economic growth against leaner, more efficient low-cost carriers such as 
Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair.
The carrier plans to raise SKr2bn ($308m) through an issue of 4bn preference shares and drum up an additional 
SKr2bn through the issue of convertible bonds, it said.
"The capital injected will primarily be used to strengthen SAS's financial ability for continued renewal of the aircraft 
fleet . . . for more profitable production," the airline said in a statement.
Funds raised would also be used "to strengthen SAS's financial preparedness and to reduce its dependence on 
bank financing".
SAS , which has signed a EUR150m financing agreement with UBS, said it could increase the share issue to raise 
a further SKr1.5bn if needed.

The airline was weeks away from bankruptcy in late 2012 when it reached agreements with pilots and cabin crew 
on pay cuts and benefit curbs. It warned in December it would miss financial goals for the fiscal year ending in 
October 2014.
It plans to invest in 12 long-haul and 30 short-haul aircraft over the next seven years.
SAS will use proceeds from the bond issue to refinance an outstanding convertible bond amounting to SKr1.6bn.

The ISEQ, along with most European bourses, got a lift from today's regular meeting of the ECB's governing 
council, which kept rates on hold and played down deflationary worries.
By the close, the index was up 69.96 points to 4,764.58.
The European Central Bank left interest rates at a record low today but put markets on alert for a possible move in 
March, acknowledging that emerging-market turbulence could hit the euro zone. Risks to the currency bloc's 
economy remain skewed to the downside, ECB President Mario Draghi said after interest rates were held at 0.25 
percent, and inflation would be low for a protracted period. "Developments in global money and financial market 
conditions and related uncertainties, notably in the emerging- market economies, may have the potential to 
negatively affect economic conditions," Draghi told a news conference. "The reason for today's decision not to act 
has really to do with the complexity of the situation ... and the need to acquire more information," he said.

Ryanair today said that passengers can now use their portable electronic devices (PEDs) - tablets, smartphones, e-
readers and MP3 players - for the entire duration of their flights.
That is once these devices are switched to 'flight mode' and all safety demos/briefings are observed, it said.
This is the latest customer initiative introduced by Ryanair as it continues to improve its battered and bruised 
customer service record, and follows the recent roll out of allocated seats for all customers, which was successfully 
introduced last Saturday.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: "Ryanair customers can now use their personal electronic devices at all stages of their 
flight, while they enjoy their allocated seats, our low fares and on-time arrivals. The IAA is one of the first regulatory 
authorities in the world to approve this measure and we wish to commend them for their initiative. We are working 
hard to improve our service to all customers and today's PED approval is the latest in a series of changes which we 
know our customers will love."

Ryanair this morning said that its passenger numbers rose by 5pc to 4.6 million in January.
In the year to January, the Irish no-frills airline carried 81.6 million people, a rise on 3pc on the year before.
Its load factor - an industry-wide measure of how well airlines fill their aircraft - was unmoved at 71pc in the month 
and stood at 83pc for the year to the end of January.
"Ryanair carried 4.6m customers in January, thanks to the success of our lower fares, our easier to use website 
and customer service improvements including allocated seats from last Saturday (1 Feb) and use of personal 
electronic devices from today. Further improvements will be rolled out over the coming months as Ryanair 
continues to lower prices and improve our industry leading customer service," said Ryanair's Robin Kiely.

The country's biggest telecoms acquisition in a decade hangs in the balance with the European Commission 
lodging a statement of objections to the E700m takeover of O2 Ireland by 3 Ireland.
Fears of reduced access to the market for new entrants and an over-concentration of 4G spectrum are believed to 
be among the concerns harboured by the European body.
The commission is also understood to be considering fears that network-sharing deals such as those active 
between O2 Ireland and Eircom might fall into doubt.
"3 Ireland are analysing the statement and we will be responding to the commission's concerns," said a spokesman 
for the company. The Irish Independent XXXX Ryanair will ground fewer aircraft next winter as it uses its fleet to 
chase business travellers during the slower tourist season, according to the airline's boss, Michael O'Leary. The 
carrier will launch special business-fare products in May and has been eyeing the market as it derives more of its 
growth from primary airports around Europe. Mr O'Leary was speaking as Ryanair shares soared nearly 8pc as the 
airline reported strong forward bookings, despite the carrier posting a E35m loss in the three months to the end of 
December. Revenue was virtually unchanged at E964m, with a 9pc decline in average fares offset by a 13pc rise in 
ancillary revenue. It's on track to make a full-year profit of about E510m. The Irish Independent XXXX Corruption

Airlines are beginning to push for discounts on current generation Boeing 777s, as the airframer looks to bridge a 
gap in deliveries until the 777X enters service at the end of the decade.
âEœI think it is common knowledge that aircraft tend to be sold to large and good customers with substantial 
discounts,âE says Christoph Franz, chief executive of the Lufthansa Group, on a potential 777 discount during a 
media event in New York on 30 January. âEœSo, the question of if there is additional discount to the existing 
discount, that is an interesting question. Hopefully, we would be able to achieve this discount.âE
The list price of a 777 freighter is $300.5 million, according to Boeing.
The groupâE™s freight arm Lufthansa Cargo operates two 777 freighters with three more on order. However, it has 
not selected a replacement for the 13 Boeing MD-11s that will remain in its fleet after the last 777 delivery in 2015.
âEœThere are at least 13 MD-11 freighters waiting for roll over,âE says Franz. âEœFor us, this gives a perspective 
that there will be demand in the future for further freighter aircraft and the 777, as we have already five on our 
orderbook, is a nice aircraft and hopefully we would be one of the customers.âE
This is where further discounts could come in.
The Chicago-based airframer faces a steep drop in 777 deliveries after 2016. Deliveries will fall to just six in 2018 
from 56 in 2016, FlightglobalâE™s Ascend Online database shows. They pick up again with the entry-into-service 
of the 777-9X in 2020.
Boeing acknowledges a need to fill this gap.
Airlines begin push for discounted end-of-line 777s âE‹Airlines are beginning to push for discounts on current 
generation Boeing 777s, as the airframer looks to....
âEœWe anticipate being able to build that bridge over the next number of years as we approach 2020,âE said Jim 
McNerney, chairman and chief executive of Boeing, during an earnings call on 29 January. âEœWe are working 
with [customers] on combined orders for the current 777 as well as the new one. And we anticipate at least the 
same kind of result that we had with the [7]37.âE
Boeing has discounted end-of-line next generation 737s, which helped it land an order from Ryanair for 175 737-
800s in March 2013. Deliveries will continue through 2018.
The first 737 Max delivery is scheduled for the second quarter of 2017.
BoeingâE™s cost control initiatives are critical to any 777 discounts. These include the partnership for success 
programme where the airframer is forging long-term partnerships with certain suppliers in order to reduce costs in 
the near term, and its new contract with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) 
for work on the widebody.
McNerney implied in his recent comments that these initiatives will likely help Boeing maintain its profit margins on 
the current generation 777 during the bridge.
âEœNow the partnering for success will be hitting it's mid-stride right around the time that the [777] bridge is being 
implemented and thatâE™s not by accident,âE he said.
In addition to discounts, Boeing could reduce the production rate of the 777 from 8.3 per month âE" about 100 
aircraft per year âE" to help counter the gap in deliveries.
Lufthansa Cargo became the first operator of the type in the group, when it took delivery of its first 777 freighter in 
November 2013.
Entry-into-service was uneventful, says Franz. âEœThe best news of it âE" I didnâE™t get any complaints,âE he 
says.
Swiss will begin taking delivery of six 777-300ERs begin in 2016 and Lufthansa has an order for 34 777-9X aircraft 
with deliveries beginning after 2020.

Highlight: Ryanair Ltd has announced a partnership with Google to make its flight information available on Google 
Flight Search.
Body
Ryanair announced that its low fares are now available on Google Flight Search, allowing even faster access to its 
1,600 routes and ensuring Google Flight Search users can see just how much cheaper Ryanair's fares are 
compared to every other European airline. Using Google Flight Search, customers in the UK, France, Germany, 
Italy, the Netherlands and Spain (as well as Canada and the USA) can quickly find and compare flights to and from 
any of Ryanair's 186 airports in Europe and North Africa, view prices in their local currency and then book these low 
fares directly with Ryanair. Google's Flight Search feature also allows users to: explore possible destinations and 
view live ticket prices by surfing on an interactive map; browse and filter flights by price, airline, flight duration or 
date selector; and see a simple list of the most relevant flights, which are listed in order of price. 
Ryanair's partnership with Google Flight Search is the latest in a series of new digital innovations as Ryanair 
continues to improve its industry leading customer service, including a new Ryanair.com homepage and booking 
flow and a "My Ryanair" customer registration system, with mobile boarding passes, business and family products, 
a new mobile app and an entire Ryanair.com website overhaul to follow in the coming weeks and months. Ryanair's 
Michael O'Leary said: "Ryanair is pleased to announce our partnership with Google Flight Search which will 
dramatically change how Europe's passengers select and book their flights. Customers can now view Ryanair's 
lowest fares on Google Flight Search, browsing by country, date or flight duration and can book these low fares 
directly on Ryanair.com through Google Flight Search. This is the latest digital innovation we have rolled out and 
will be followed in early 2014 by mobile boarding passes, an improved app and a brand new Ryanair.com website." 
Google's David Robles said: "Research suggests that users tend to visit around twenty different sites before they 
book a flight. Google wants to help improve the travel experience by drastically reducing the time wasted on 
researching and booking flights. Google Flight Search is fast, easy to use and interactive so business people, 
parents, and star crossed lovers can quickly pay for their travel and get back to their work, parenting or pining. We 
want to give users as many flight options as possible, so introducing Ryanair, which is Europe's largest airline, to 
the Google Flight Search family is very exciting."

Ryanair looks to be regaining its footing in the competitive European low-cost airline market after a stumble last 
year, when it reported a rise in advance bookings and passenger numbers.
Shares in the budget airline rose yesterday as investors welcomed signs that its strategy was beginning to yield 
results. That came despite an overall post-tax loss of EUR35.2m during the last three months of the year, typically a 
weak period for airlines.
Actions such as bringing in a more user-friendly website, the move to allocated seating and priority boarding helped 
draw 6 per cent more passengers, taking the total to 18.3m in the third quarter and boosting ancillary revenue 13 
per cent.
However, Ryanair 's average fare fell 9 per cent as it offered discounts in response to a weak market in the autumn. 
Weaker sterling also hit trading.
"We responded to this weaker pricing environment in September with seat promotions and lower fares which 
stimulated traffic across markets," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
Michael Cawley, chief operating officer, said the outlook was improving. "While demand is soft, it has stopped 
falling."

Passenger comfort has never been a watchword at Ryanair. Last autumn, its investors started to feel cramped, too. 
Europe's biggest budget carrier gave two profit warnings. But those who kept faith were rewarded yesterday, when 
the airline talked of stabilising ticket prices in the market overall and offered a more cheerful outlook for its own 
yields for the March quarter. Coupled with typically disciplined figures on the cost side in the first nine months of 
2013-14, and confirmation that full-year net profits should be in the EUR500m-EUR520m range, the news drove the 
shares up 7 per cent. They have recovered almost two-thirds of the autumn loss.
Still, those who concluded that Ryanair's plan was to take price competition to emboldened rivals - Norwegian, say - 
and to expand its market through a slew of customer service initiatives, look vindicated. The first was a battle that 
the airline, with its lower cost base, was always likely to win. Its average fares were down 9 per cent, year on year, 
in the third quarter but passenger numbers rose 6 per cent and load factors nudged higher. With ancillary sales 
growing at a double-digit rate (goodbye, baggage fees: hello, reserved seating charges), revenues overall were flat.
The second is a more fundamental shift. Ryanair has begun to push into "mainstream" airports, such as Belgium's 
Zaventem, and is talking of joining an industry reservation system to woo business travellers. The trick will be to do 
this in a way that does not chip away at Ryanair's cost edge and leaves it sitting pretty when its extra capacity starts 
to arrive this year. Still, on the airport front at least, so far so good. Ryanair says savings at Dublin and Stansted 
should mean little change overall in airport costs next year. Its shares are back to over 14 times 2014-15 consensus 
earnings and the odds are on further uplift.

Average fares fall after weak demand
Body
Ryanair looks to be regaining its footing in the competitive European low-cost airline market after a stumble last 
year, when it reported a rise in advance bookings and passenger numbers.
Shares in the budget airline rose yesterday as investors welcomed signs that its strategy was beginning to yield 
results. That came despite an overall post-tax loss of EUR35.2m during the last three months of the year, typically a 
weak period for airlines.
Actions such as bringing in a more user-friendly website, the move to allocated seating and priority boarding helped

per cent.
However, Ryanair 's average fare fell 9 per cent as it offered discounts in response to a weak market in the autumn. 
Weaker sterling also hit trading.
"We responded to this weaker pricing environment in September with seat promotions and lower fares which 
stimulated traffic across all markets, resulting in 6 per cent growth in the third quarter, and a 1 per cent rise in 
monthly load factors," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.

Michael Cawley, chief operating officer, said the outlook was improving. "While demand is soft, it has stopped 
falling." he said. "It has stabilised, definitely."
Revenue per passenger dipped 6 per cent, while overall revenue in the quarter was EUR964m.
Ryanair was left on the back foot last year after rival Easyjet gained an advantage with initiatives such as allocated 
seating. It was forced to play catch-up by vowing to transform the way it treated customers and bring in fresh 
measures such as trying to win more business travellers.
The trading update was broadly in line with consensus and analysts welcomed its reported growth in forward 
bookings, and the airline's forecast that it would continue to increase passenger numbers and grow at primary 
airports this year.
"They have had a clear strategy to stimulate demand with competitive pricing and they are retaining customers 
because they are improving their quality of service," said Dónal O'Neill, an analyst at Goodbody.
"I think things are going exactly as they would have liked them to."
The airline restated that it expected its full-year net profit to be about EUR510m. It issued two profit warnings 
towards the end of last year and said full-year net profit would be between EUR500m and EUR520m, which would 
be the first fall for five years.
"Our third-quarter loss of EUR35m is in line with previous guidance and is entirely due to a 9 per cent fall in average 
fares and weaker sterling," said Mr O'Leary.
"We have proved that we are up to speed and we are ahead of the competition," said Mr Cawley.
Its shares were up 6.81 per cent to EUR6.74 yesterday.

RYANAIR said its customer services revamp was already impressing passengers, pushing its shares higher 
yesterday despite a pre-tax loss of (EURO)35m (£29m) in the final three months of 2013.
The low-cost carrier cut its average fare by nine per cent in the quarter to try and shore up its sales. Demand has 
now "stopped falling, it's stabilised", said deputy chief executive Michael Cawley.
Ryanair followed its smaller rival EasyJet into allocated seating and a more forgiving stance on lost boarding 
passes last year in the wake of two profit warnings.
Yesterday, the firm repeated its profit forecast in the year to the end of March at between (EURO)500m and 
(EURO)520m.
Passenger numbers in the quarter were up six per cent at 18.3m, though discounted tickets meant revenues were 
flat at (EURO)964m.
Bookings into the summer "are running significantly ahead of last year, albeit at weaker yields", the firm said in a 
statement yesterday.
"This business needs to be changed, it needs to be constantly changed," Cawley told reporters. "Of course we 
should have done it earlier but we've done it and we will be better than anyone in a few months."
But when asked if Ryanair is becoming part of the airline establishment, Cawley replied: "Perish the thought… 
Ryanair will always be the lowest cost operator."
Shares in the Dublin-listed carrier closed up more than six per cent at (EURO)6.73.

The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) has issued over 1,000 pre-Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) codes since launching its 
online application service through www.ISEdirect.ie last autumn, it said this morning.
Demand is set to rise as some organisations need to have pre-LEIs for regulatory reporting purposes under 
European securities legislation, which comes into effect on 12th February.
LEI is a global reference code which uniquely identifies each legal entity that engages in a financial transaction.
This regulatory initiative is designed to enable the identification and linking of parties to financial transactions and 
facilitates the better management of counterparty risk. Among the 1,000 codes issued, the ISE's customers 
includes well-known Irish brands such as Kingspan, Ryanair, Smurfit Kappa and Musgrave Group, international 
banks like Morgan Stanley, national service providers such as RTE and ESB as well as a large range of investment 
funds and debt issuers, both listed on the ISE and elsewhere. In addition, some SMEs in Ireland that engage in 
foreign exchange transactions to manage currency risk have also been applying for codes. The geographic spread 
of the ISE's customer base for their new service extends far beyond Ireland and includes Australia, USA and 
Canada, the United Arab Emirates and a wide range of European countries - United Kingdom, Germany, France, 
Spain and Italy. The LEI requirement is part of the international response by regulatory authorities to the global 
financial crisis. In December, the ISE was only the sixth organisation worldwide to be endorsed by the Regulatory 
Oversight Committee (ROC), the global body of regulators which oversees adherence to the LEI standards. The 
Central Bank of Ireland, which has sponsored the ISE as the pre-LEI provider in Ireland, is a member of the ROC. 
James Ferguson, Head of Operations and LEI Lead said, "The ISE's user friendly and simple application process 
on www.ISEdirect.ie has enabled us to attract entities, both existing and new customers. Based on customer 
feedback, we expect this strong interest in the ISE service to continue." Brian Healy, Director of Traded Markets, 
Development, Operations added, "We are delighted with the success of our pre-LEI service - having delivered over 
Irish Exchange issue 1k-plus LEI codes ISE LEI Codes
1,000 pre-LEI codes to more than 20 jurisdictions across the globe, the level of take-up is a real validation of the 
strength and quality of our offering and its international potential. The ISE has been at the forefront of the LEI 
initiative globally and our early endorsement by the Regulatory Oversight Committee re-enforces our expertise in 
this area."

The ISEQ rose steadily this morning, led by a near-7pc jump in Ryanair shares after it posted some strong 
indicators for future trading.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 36.83 points to 4,689.13.
Shares in Ryanair rose by 38c to E6.70 after it reported strong forward bookings and an easing of intense price 
competition among European airlines today, raising hopes it can quickly regain height with a new customer-friendly 
image after a profit warning spooked markets last year. Shares in the Irish airline, Europe's largest by passenger 
numbers, opened up 6 percent after it said it was already seeing improved demand for tickets following the changes 
to how it treats customers announced late last year. Ryanair lost 35 million euros after tax in the three months to 
Dec. 31, its worst performance in its seasonally weak third quarter since 2008. But the loss was in line with the 
warning last year and it reaffirmed the airline's forecast for a profit of between 500 million euros and 520 million for 
the full year ending in March. "Market pricing remains soft but is no longer declining," Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary said. Average fares will fall 8 percent in the first three months of 2013 rather than the 10 percent previously 
predicted," he said.
Elsewhere, shares in Aryzta fell 73c to E57.75. On January 30th, a new bakery cafe was opened in Los Angeles by 
La Brea, the US artisan-style bread subsidiary of Aryzta. It is up the street from where La Brea started. The cafe 
bakery Campanile, run by Nancy Silverton and her husband, closed in 2012. Nancy Silverton, who has remained an 
advisor since La Brea was acquired in 2001 by IAWS (which merged with Hiestand to form Aryzta), cut the ribbon 
on the new bakery cafe. La Brea is iconic in southern California with respect to its breads and because of 
contribution to the re-development of American cooking, Davy noted.

Ryanair reported its biggest third-quarter loss in five years today as average fares slumped 9 percent, but 
management said intense price competition in Europe was easing and forward bookings were up.
The Irish airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, issued its first profit warnings in a decade last year on 
weak winter bookings but has said it hopes to bounce back by improving its customer service.
The carrier said it lost 35 million euros (dollar 47.2 million) in the three months to Dec. 31, its worst performance in 
its traditionally weak third quarter since 2008.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the loss, due to lower average fares and weaker sterling, was expected and 
he reaffirmed the airline's guidance for profit of between 500 million euros and 520 million for the year. "Market 
pricing remains soft but is no longer declining," he said. Ryanair flew 6 percent more passengers in the last three 
months of 2013 compared with a year earlier, but revenue was flat due to the fall in ticket prices. British rival 
easyJet by comparison increased revenue 7.7 percent on passenger numbers growth of 4.2 percent in the same 
period. After being voted the worst of the 100 biggest brands serving the British market by readers of consumer 
magazine Which?, Ryanair said last year it was cutting baggage and boarding card fees, allowing passengers to 
bring a second carry-on bag and introducing assigned seating on all planes. Deputy Chief Executive Michael 
Cawley said the changes had not yet had an impact on profit, but that there signs the strategy was starting to bear 
fruit. "There has been a very positive reaction ... particularly in terms of forward bookings which we have never had 
as substantially ahead," Cawley said. ( C ) Reuters

The ISEQ bucked the global equities trend today thanks to a near-7pc jump in Ryanair shares after it posted some 
strong indicators for future trading.
The ISEQ gained 36.83 points to 4,689.13.
Shares in Ryanair rose by 40c to E6.71 after it reported strong forward bookings and an easing of intense price 
competition among European airlines today, raising hopes it can quickly regain height with a new customer-friendly 
image after a profit warning spooked markets last year. Shares in the Irish airline, Europe's largest by passenger 
numbers, opened up 6 percent after it said it was already seeing improved demand for tickets following the changes 
to how it treats customers announced late last year. Ryanair lost 35 million euros after tax in the three months to 
Dec. 31, its worst performance in its seasonally weak third quarter since 2008. But the loss was in line with the 
warning last year and it reaffirmed the airline's forecast for a profit of between 500 million euros and 520 million for 
the full year ending in March. "Market pricing remains soft but is no longer declining," Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary said. Average fares will fall 8 percent in the first three months of 2013 rather than the 10 percent previously 
predicted," he said.
Elsewhere, shares in Aryzta fell 148c to E57.00. On January 30th, a new bakery cafe was opened in Los Angeles

warning. "There had been an expectation that there might be a further downgrade. But the tone of the statement is 
quite positive looking into next year," said Donal O'Neill, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers. Ryanair flew 6

strategy was starting to bear fruit. "There has been a very positive reaction ... particularly in terms of forward 
bookings which we have never had as substantially ahead," Cawley said. The company's marketing spend is set to 
triple to 35 million euros this year, but that this would be dwarfed by savings from airport costs, he added.

The ISEQ is higher this morning at 4,683, up 31 points but lower than early trading as European manufacturing data 
comes in a little better than expected, at least from the bailout countries. Chinese data may curtail any euphoria.
Davy Stockbrokers puts the Ryanair losses into perspective:
Ryanair's net loss of E35m was in line with previous guidance and includes average fares down 9pc, passenger 
growth of 6pc and a 13pc rise in ancillary revenues. Operating expenses increased by 6pc, with fuel up 10pc.
Unit costs ex-fuel fell by 3pc and by 9pc on a sector-length-adjusted basis, underscoring its cost leadership. The 
balance sheet has gross cash of E2.825bn, net debt of E365m (after E414m in buybacks, nearly E500m now in FY 
2014) and should be back to net cash by the March year-end. A further c.E500m will be returned to shareholders in 
FY 2015 via a mix of special dividends and some limited share buybacks. Retains full-year guidance (profit range 
E500-520m) but FY 2015 shaping up to be a year of margin expansion Ryanair expects Q4 yields to decline by 
c.8pc (slightly better than the 10pc previously guided) with rising load factors and traffic up to 81.5m passengers for 
FY 2014. Ex-fuel costs are expected to fall c.4pc in the quarter. FY 2015 is shaping up to be a year of margin 
expansion, with commentary that the strategy of lowering fares and increased forward bookings is enabling the 
airline to better manage close-in bookings and yields as it moves into summer 2014. Fuel hedging has been 
extended to 90pc of FY 2015 (from 60pc) at dollar 960 per tonne and with the EUR/USD hedging allowing for a fuel 
cost saving of c.E80m in FY 2015. We are likely to leave our forecasts for FY 2014 and FY 2015 of net income of 
E510m and E644m respectively unchanged. New routes/bases; customer service and digital strategy should drive 
performance The uptake of allocated seating should allow for strong ancillary revenues in FY 2015 and customer 
service improvements should drive stronger forward bookings and load factors. Ryanair will appear in one or more 
GDS channels by mid-year, significantly enhancing the business platform. New bases are booking well. We expect

Ryanair's digital rollout, combined with its lowest cost base model, to be a winning proposition according to Davy

(RTTNews) - The UK market is trading lower on Monday, after an indicator of Chinese non-manufacturing sector 
activity declined in January, signaling that the economy is slowing amid Beijing's efforts to push through the 
planned reforms.
China's non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index declined to 53.4 in January from 54.6 in December, the 
results of a survey by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing and the National Bureau of Statistics 
showed.
In Germany, manufacturing sector growth rose to its strongest in thirty-two months in January, a survey by Markit 
Economics showed. The headline Markit/BME purchasing managers' index rose to a 32-month high of 56.5 in 
January from 54.3 in December. The flash result showed a reading of 56.3.
Meanwhile, the Eurozone manufacturing sector grew slightly more than initially expected in January, Markit 
Economics showed. The final results of Purchasing Managers' survey revealed that the manufacturing activity grew 
at the strongest rate since May 2011. The headline PMI has risen in each of the past four months and has signaled 
growth since July last year.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is losing 0.72 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is falling 0.60 percent.
The FTSE 100 index is falling 0.26 percent.

PPI business. Barclays is losing 1.8 percent.
ARM is falling 1.2 percent. Deutsche Bank cut the stock to ''Hold'' from ''Buy.''
Smith & Nephew, which agreed to buy US-based Arthrocare, is rising 1.6 percent.
Ryanair, which reported financial results, is gaining 5.7 percent.
RM, which proposed special dividend, is climbing 8.8 percent.
Other major markets in the region are trading lower.
UK Market Drops
The Asian stocks fell across the board, as data pointing to slowing growth in China's manufacturing and services 
sectors added to concerns the global economic recovery is faltering.
In the U.S., futures point to a lower open on Wall Street. In the previous session, stocks closed firmly in negative 
territory, as investors digested a handful of disappointing earnings reports and mixed economic data. The Dow shed 
0.9 percent, the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell half a percent and the S&P 500 slid 0.7 percent.
Crude for March delivery is falling $0.59 to $96.90 per barrel, while April gold is gaining $3.7 to $1243.5 a troy 
ounce.

Ryanair Slips To Loss On Lower Fares, Reaffirms Full-year Profit View
Ryanair Slips To Loss On Lower Fares, Reaffirms Full-year Profit View

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) Monday reported a loss for the third 
quarter, compared to a profit last year, reflecting 9 percent fall in average fares and weaker sterling. Revenues were 
flat, while traffic improved and ancillary revenues climbed 13 percent from the prior year. The company forecast an 
unchanged profit for the full year.
According to the company, its new routes and bases are performing well this winter, and expects these new bases 
to provide substantial growth opportunities for Ryanair. The market pricing remains soft but is no longer declining, 
the firm added.
CEO Michael O'Leary said, "We responded to this weaker pricing environment last September with seat promotions 
and lower fares which stimulated traffic across all markets resulting in 6% growth in Q3, and a 1% rise in monthly 
load factors."
Loss attributable to equity holders of parent was 35.2 million euros, or 2.50 euro cents per share, compared to a 
profit of 18.1 million euros or 1.25 euro cents per share in the prior year.
Loss before tax was 41.8 million euros, compared to a profit of 19.3 million euros a year earlier.
Total operating revenues slightly declined to 964.4 million euros from 968.8 million euros reported last year, 
reflecting 9 percent decrease in average fares, offset by a 13 percent rise in ancillary revenues and a 6 percent 
increase in passenger numbers.
Traffic grew 6 percent to 18 million passengers. Load factor was 82 percent, compared to 81 percent in the 
preceding year.
Revenue per passenger declined 6 percent from a year earlier.
Excluding fuel, sector length adjusted unit costs dropped 9 percent. Ancillary revenues climbed 13 percent, helped 
by strong customer uptake of reserved seating, priority boarding, and higher credit card fees, the company said.
Total operating expenses climbed 6 percent to 987.4 million, due to the 10 percent rise in fuel costs and increased 
costs associated with growth of the airline.
Ryanair Slips To Loss On Lower Fares, Reaffirms Full-year Profit View
Looking ahead, the company expects fourth-quarter yields to decline by about 8 percent, slightly better than the 10 
percent decline previously guided. The firm aims that its cost control measures will deliver a 4 percent fall in unit 
costs, ex-fuel in the quarter.
The company said it remains confident to deliver full-year net profit out-turn to be in the range of 500 million euros 
to 520 million euros as projected earlier. The company expects its fiscal 2014 traffic to rise to 81.5 million 
passengers, slightly higher than previously guided.
RYA.L is currently trading at 6.61 euros, up 0.30 euros or 4.83 percent, on a volume of 1.58 million shares.

(RTTNews) - The European markets ended the first day of the new trading week in negative territory. Investor 
sentiment was impacted by the drop in Chinese non-manufacturing data, which signaled that the economy is 
slowing amid Beijing's efforts to push through the planned reforms. The Chinese data overshadowed the Eurozone 
manufacturing data, which moved back into expansion territory.
An indicator of Chinese non-manufacturing sector activity declined in January, in another sign that the economy is 
slowing amid Beijing's efforts to push through the planned reforms. The non-manufacturing purchasing managers' 
index declined to 53.4 in January from 54.6 in December, the results of a survey by the China Federation of 
Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP) and the National Bureau of Statistics showed Monday.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks declined by 1.63 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, lost 1.56 percent.
The DAX of Germany dropped by 1.29 percent and the CAC 40 of France tumbled by 1.39 percent. The FTSE 100 
of the U.K. decreased by 1.11 percent and the SMI of Switzerland fell by 1.03 percent.
In Frankfurt, RTL Group declined by 2.62 percent. Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to ''Neutral'' from ''Buy.''
Hawesko dipped 0.20 percent. The stock was downgraded to ''Hold'' from ''Add'' at Commerzbank.
Evonik rose by 0.70 percent, after Exane BNP started the stock with an ''Outperform'' rating.
In London, Lloyds Banking Group dropped by 3.97 percent. The lender said it has made a further provision of 1.8 
billion pounds for legacy PPI business. Barclays lost 2.50 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland sank by 1.97 
percent.
ARM Holdings decreased by 0.53 percent. Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to ''Hold'' from ''Buy.''
Smith & Nephew advanced by 1.14 percent, after it agreed to buy US-based Arthrocare.
Ryanair, which reported financial results, increased by 6.81 percent.
RM, which proposed a special dividend, surged by 14.60 percent.
European Markets Pulled Back On China Concerns
Julius Baer tumbled by 5.93 percent in Zurich. The private banking group said it expects to achieve the asset 
transfer target from the integration of Merrill Lynch's International Wealth Management to be towards the lower end 
of the 57 billion francs to 72 billion francs range.
The Eurozone manufacturing sector grew slightly more than initially expected in January, Markit Economics showed 
Monday.
The final results of Purchasing Managers' survey revealed that the manufacturing activity grew at the strongest rate 
since May 2011. The headline PMI has risen in each of the past four months and has signaled growth since July 
last year.
The PMI rose to 54 in January, above the flash estimate of 53.9, from December's score of 52.7. The expansion led 
by Germany, and the Greek PMI moves back into expansion territory.
German manufacturing sector growth rose to its strongest in thirty-two months in January, a survey by Markit 
Economics showed Monday. The headline Markit/BME purchasing managers' index rose to a 32-month high of 56.5 
in January from 54.3 in December. The flash result showed a reading of 56.3.
French manufacturing sector contracted less than initially estimated in January, final results of a survey by Markit 
Economics showed Monday. The final purchasing managers' index rose to a four-month high of 49.3 in January 
from 47 in December. The flash survey results published last month showed a reading of 48.8 for January.
The U.K. manufacturing sector continued to expand in January, reflecting improvement in output and new orders, 
survey data from Markit Economics showed Monday.
The seasonally adjusted Markit/Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-
than-expected to 56.7 in January from 57.2 in December. Economists had forecast the reading to fall to 57.1 from 
December's originally estimate score of 57.3.
The average asking prices for a house in the United Kingdom was up 0.3 percent in January compared to the 
previous month, property tracking website Hometrack said on Monday in its monthly survey. That's slower than the 
0.5 percent monthly increase in December, although it represented an expansion for the 12th consecutive month.
While the Institute for Supply Management released a report on Monday showing modest growth in U.S. 
manufacturing activity in the month of January, the pace of growth slowed much more than economists had been 
anticipating.
The ISM said its purchasing managers index fell to 51.3 in January from a revised 56.5 in December. A reading 
above 50 indicates continued growth in the manufacturing sector, but economists had expected the index to show a 
much more modest decrease to a reading of 56.0.
Construction spending in the U.S. showed a slight increase in the month of December, according to a report 
released by the Commerce Department on Monday, with an increase in spending on private construction more than 
offsetting a drop in spending on public construction.
The report said construction spending inched up by 0.1 percent to an annual rate of $930.5 billion in December 
from the revised November estimate of $929.9 billion. Economists had expected spending to come in unchanged 
compared to the previous month.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair's strategy of cutting fare prices to keep planes full is costing it.
Europe's largest budget airline suffered a net loss of 35.2 million euros ($47.5 million) in the last three months of 
2013, compared with a profit of 18.1 million euros a year earlier.
It reduced fares by an average of 9 percent in the quarter, the third of its fiscal year. That helped it attract 18.3 
million passengers, up 6 percent on the year.
The figures Monday came after a profit warning in November, when the airline pledged to maintain discounts.
Ryanair is trying to change its corporate culture after customer criticism. The airline introduced fully assigned 
seating this week - a change from a model that required customers to form lengthy lines and scramble for seats.

MANUFACTURING data, due out today, is the first of the UK survey figures that will be the highlights of this week's 
economic calendar.
Construction figures will follow tomorrow and services data on Wednesday, with all sectors expected to show 
further growth. Industrial production data is due on Friday.
Martin Beck of Capital Economics said: "On balance, we think the (manufacturing) PMI could have strengthened in 
January to around 58, from 57.3 in December.
"This should set the stage for a period of strong growth in the manufacturing sector, which we think could grow by 
over three per cent in 2014."
On Thursday the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will meet to decide on interest rates. 
However, the MPC is thought likely to keep any change on hold ahead of the publication of its quarterly inflation 
report next week.
The corporate calendar begins this week with reports from Anglo Platinum, Creston, Future, Goldenport Holdings, 
Randgold and Ryanair.
Tomorrow BP and BG Group announce earnings, while Alumasc Group, ARM Holdings, Delphi Automotive, Kofax, 
Low & Bonar, Victrex, St Modwen Properties, TalkTalk, Ocado, Electrocomponents and UDG will also update the 
market.
Deutsche Bank remained pessimistic about Ocado's full-year figures, giving the retailer a "sell" rating and a price 
target of 440p, despite last year's tieup with Morrisons supermarket. The analysts said: "While we expect Ocado to

On Wednesday Wolfson Microelectronics is due to give fullyear figures while Hargreaves Lansdowne, Daily Mail

Ryanair has issued cabin crew managers with memos directing them to ''provide service with a smile and ''converse 
with customers as part of new customer service changes' in 2014.
The no frills airline issued all ''number ones, as they are described, with new instructions ten days ago, and told 
them they would be carrying out a widespread audit across all bases to ensure that crew briefings are held in ''an 
upbeat and enthusiastic manner, and that during boarding, crew ''greet our customers with a smile. . . and 
enthusiastically offer assistance.
Ryanair customers have previously complained that crew were far more interested in the shape or size of their 
cabin baggage -- and the significant fines that hand luggage over 10kg, or not the exact dimensions to fit into a 
Ryanair bag stand, attracted -- than being cordial.
In the memo, seen by *The Sunday Business Post,*Ryanair director of personnel and inflight, Robbie Wilson, 
warned about the ramifications of not complying with the new policy.
He wrote that recent MPRs (Mystery Passenger Reports) since the introduction of the new customer services 
initiatives this year, ''have highlighted that some crew have seen the introduction of quiet flights and the reduction in 
PAs [public announcements] as an opportunity to do the minimum . . . hiding in the galley and generally being 
invisible to customers -- that cannot and will not continue.
The airline is introducing a new rate my crew initiative' for top performers' to receive rewards, but while those who 
are ''deemed to fall short of the highest customer service standards will be given ''an opportunity to improve, those 
who fail to ''consistently reach the highest standards or who willfully fail to carry out their duties, ''will be removed 
from their Number One position and/or transferred from their existing base, in accordance with their contract of 
employment.

The cabin crew managers are told that being a number one ''is a privilege (particularly in our popular bases) and 
that ''privilege can only apply to those who ''consistently deliver outstanding customer service.
Crew who want to be promoted need to understand that the airline is ''raising the bar on what we expect and that 
''only those number ones who are truly leaders and inspire their crews . . . by providing for our customers . . . will 
remain in the role.
''I can't emphasise how serious we are about this, is Wilson's parting message, along with the addendum that ''the 
changes you have seen, are here to stay.

CV: Senator Mary Ann O'Brien
**Roles:**Taoiseach's nominee to the Seanad; founder of Lily O'Brien's Chocolates and the Jack and Jill Children's 
Foundation
**Age:**53
**Lives:**Ballitorie, Co Kildare
**Family:**married to Jonathan Irwin with three children -- Lily, Phonsie and Molly
**Hobbies:**gardening, showjumping and the odd game of golf
.....
When Senator Mary Ann O'Brien sits into a soft seat in a quiet, stately room in Dail Eireann, she exhales softly, as if 
she had not sat for days, at least not in relaxation.
It had taken two weeks to pin her down. Sources had whispered that her chocolate company, Lily O'Brien's, was 
about to be bought. She was not answering her phone. As the newspaper's deadline for last Sunday loomed, she 
had finally called back.
''I was out on a horse for a few hours, It's the only place I can get away from it all, she had said apologetically, 
before confirming the deal had been closed the night before.
The EUR 300 million Carlyle Cardinal Ireland SME Equity Fund, in which the National Pension Reserve Fund is a 
significant shareholder, is understood to have taken 80 per cent of the company, leaving O'Brien with 20 per cent 
and a cheque for probably around EUR 4 million. Confidentiality agreements mean she is unable to confirm the 
figures.
The Sunday Interview: Senator Mary Ann O'Brien
Hours after signing the deal, she was heading for the airport to go to ISM in Cologne, the world's biggest 
confectionery trade fair, to fill her order books for Easter 2015.
''The new investors have huge plans, O'Brien says, audibly jubilant. ''They are investing a million this year to double 
capacity. We want to get to EUR 40 or EUR 50 million turnover. At the moment, we are just over the EUR 20 million 
mark and on the way up.
Four days later, she arrives back at Leinster House ''straight from the runway with the division bell ringing 
incessantly through the house. First she must contribute to a debate on Seanad reform and cast a vote. But, later, 
as Leinster House falls quiet for the evening, O'Brien finally has an hour to sit and tell her story, before rushing off 
again to see her children, ahead of yet another trip on the Ryanair ''red eye in the morning.
.....
Three years ago, major investment in Lily O'Brien's probably seemed remote. It had built much of its success on 
providing fancy chocolate for airline passengers, counting 23 carriers, including Aer Lingus, British Airways and the 
world's biggest -- United -- among its customers. But by 2011, economic woes were driving airlines out of business 
and posh chocolates out of cabins. In just 18 months, Lily O'Briens went from selling seven million ''two choc boxes 
down to 1.3 million.
Chocs were out of favour. British Airways wanted chocolate mousse instead. Lily O'Brien's technical team ruled it 
out. The factory was not set up to handle a product made from fresh cream.
Mary Ann O'Brien was not going to give up so easily. She went home to her own kitchen and made 16 different 
chocolate mousses and flew with them to the British Airways chef. He chose one and ordered 2.8 million more for 
the year from the following May.
''I didn't tell him we didn't have a dessert factory and that I had made the mousse myself in my own kitchen. So we 
built a dessert factory and we now do all the desserts for British Airways. Desserts now account for close to 20 per 
cent of turnover and growing.
.....
Walk into any craft fair or country market on a cold Saturday afternoon and look at the wistful gaze on some 
stallholders' faces. O'Brien's story is the fairytale of which they dream. Or parts of it, at least.
She had been marketing manager for the Phoenix Park racecourse until it closed in 1991. She started her own 
event management company, but was suffering badly from what she describes as ''a strange immune attacking 
disease.
While holidaying in Cape Town in 1992, she noticed a chocolate chess set in her hotel reception. It had been 
crafted by the daughter of the hotel owner, who had a contract to make chocolate for BMW and Mercedes.
''Before I knew it, I was in the kitchen with her making chocolate. I wasn't seen again for the rest of the holiday.
Back in her kitchen at a flat she was renting in the grounds of Carton House in Kildare, she set to work with nothing 
more than her cooker, three saucepans and the enormous American-style fridge her new husband Jonathan Irwin 
had moved into the apartment. By June 1992, she had secured a £36,000 loan from AIB and bought her first proper 
machine.
''I had to collect it from Dublin Airport. I didn't even realise that I had to pay duty on it. I had a lot to learn, she says.
Her first big break was to win a contract to supply Superquinn in Lucan. She was soon supplying the chain's stores 
nationwide. She rented the newly-defunct Phoenix Park racecourse kitchen and the executive suites above as 
packing rooms. She made chocolate downstairs, and sent it up in the lift to the suites to be packed.
The Sunday Interview: Senator Mary Ann O'Brien
''I was the accountant, the delivery man, the salesman, the merchandiser and the producer. Gertie and Detta, my 
only two employees, did the packing. Superquinn was a huge account for one little business and it gave me my 
opportunity. We then won a contract to supply Wrights at Dublin Airport. I would be out there in a short skirt doing 
tastings for the passengers, and then I would run back to the Phoenix Park to make more.
But there were tough times, too. In 1994 she gave birth to twins, but sadly one died.
''Nothing much has changed since for entrepreneurs -- I got back from the hospital and there was no maternity 
leave so it was straight back into the kitchen with my newborn son, Phonsie, in a basket, she says. ''When the 
health officer called, I would put Phonsie in the lift and press the button for the suites, and Gertie and Detta would 
keep him there until the inspector was gone.
Yet the three-person team was getting noticed. Aer Lingus asked her to tender for a contract to supply four million 
mints and two million ''choc boxes. The scale of the order was too big to consider.
A holiday in Waterford changed all that. There, she met beef baron Peter Queally, and struck up a conversation.
''He is a serial entrepreneur. He could see I was madly passionate, but badly needed direction. He asked had I 
considered a BES. I thought he was talking about a cow disease.
Months later, Queally had bought into 50 per cent of Lily O'Brien's and helped guide it through a BES âEUR     a 
business expansion scheme -- that raised £1 million from tax break investors to build a factory in Naas, Co Kildare. 
The Aer Lingus contract was in the bag and O'Brien was eyeing up British Airways.
''Once we got to grips with Heathrow, anything was possible, she says.
.....
In 1996, as the business began to hum, O'Brien and her family were faced with an unimaginably difficult situation.
Two years after losing one child, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Jack. But two days later, he suffered a 
trauma that left him unable to swallow and most likely blind and deaf. The hospital had no hope to offer. O'Brien 
and her husband Jonathan refused to abandon Jack to a short life in a hospital and, with the help of neighbours, 
cared for him at home until he passed away 22 months later.
Out of the experience was born the Jack & Jill Foundation, led by Irwin with O'Brien on the board. It has since 
raised nearly EUR 50 million to fund home respite care for families of brain-damaged children. Little wonder that, 
upon her appointment to Seanad Eireann in 2011, charity regulation was top of her agenda, long before the current 
storm of controversy surrounding the sector erupted.
''I couldn't believe we didn't have a charities regulator, she says. ''We give away EUR 4 billion a year of taxpayers' 
money without even a website displaying where it goes.
She spent a year researching the issue, travelling to talk to regulators in England and Scotland.
''We need more than just soft-touch regulation. It must be belt and braces, and quickly. Irish citizens should be able 
to look up and see anyone who is earning more than EUR 60,000 and to be able to see what percentage of their 
funding comes from the government.
In the case of Jack & Jill, she says, 19 per cent of its funding comes from government. Her husband earns just 
under EUR 90,000 with no added pension or other perks.
This, she says, is an entirely justifiable salary considering his ''incredible dedication, the EUR 50 million he has 
raised and the six initial years he put in for free.
.....
The Sunday Interview: Senator Mary Ann O'Brien
O'Brien was putting the finishing touches to the new dessert factory in the early summer of 2011 when her 
receptionist told her the Taoiseach had phoned.
''I thought it was a joke. He rang back a few minutes later and it took him six minutes to convince me that he really 
was the Taoiseach, she says. ''He asked me would I be one of his nominees for the Seanad. I told him I was not 
interested in Fine Gael, but would do it as an independent.
She has been true to her word, opposing both his bid to abolish the Seanad and last year's abortion legislation. She 
is now a strong supporter of Seanad reform.
''If we had left Lily O'Brien's as it was in 1995, we'd have gone out of business. Yet the Seanad is untouched since 
1937. The world has turned itself inside out since then but the Seanad, and the Dail for that matter, are still the 
same. We need to evolve, she says.
''I would love to see more Feargal Quinns, or John Crowns, or Sean Barretts, or Katherine Zappones. Or . . . She 
pauses. '' . . . Ivana Baciks.
She continues: ''There are such wonderful people here if we can keep the politics out of it. We don't need a mini-D

frustrating.
''If we had to take a public consultation on a new idea write a report on it and then debate it before actually doing it, 
Lily O'Brien's would be long gone. Politics works slower than the real world, but we do need to bring a little bit more

She praises Lucinda Creighton's recent RDS meeting as a positive example.
''I would have gone, but I was in Germany. It wasn't just a talking shop. Change needs to come. There is huge 
disillusionment. The opinion of the Irish public about politicians has never been lower.
So would O'Brien join a Reform Alliance party with Creighton at its helm? Her opaque answer shows that a 
businesswoman from the real world can also learn a thing or two from politicians.
''Oh gosh, I don't know, she says. ''I'd have to have lunch with her. We'll have to see how she gets on with this baby

Highlight: Low cost carrier is pondering ratings as it diversifies away from export credit funding for its aircraft.
Body
Ryanair has signalled it will secure a credit rating in a bid to access the capital market for its future aircraft 
deliveries. Speaking at the 16th Annual Airfinance Conference Dublin, Ryanair CFO Howard Millar stated that the 
carrier was examining securing a corporate credit rating. Airfinance Journal understands that the carrier has 
mandated a US investment bank to help with this process. Over 75% of Ryanair's fleet has relied on export credit 
support. The recent changes to the ASU has prompted a change in behaviour among many airlines who were 
traditional users of ECA-guaranteed loans. Millar states: "We have an order book of 175 aircraft. Traditionally we 
have used a mix of export credit and we have used Jolco, and sale/leasebacks transactions. Our view is that we 
should diversify our source of finance and certaintly in the current pricing in the capital markets and the structural 
financings to US Ex-Im financing it is now an area we have to explore." "This will involve potentially a rating and 
then looking to see what the opportunities there are. I think it is an area we are interested in. We do need to give 
ourselves scale. We can look at capital markets and maybe even unsecured financings."

Irish Stock Exchange to launch aviation exchange

Highlight: ISE says new exchange will provide "visibility and specialist knowledge" for the air finance sector.
Body
The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) has announced it will launch a dedicated exchange for aviation finance.
The ISE says it has made the announcement today in the lead-up to this week's 16th Annual Global Airfinance 
Conference in Dublin, which over 1000 senior aviation executives will attend.
ISE says 26 specialist debt instruments, with a total value of $12.7 billion, are currently listed on the Irish market by 
issuers from the aviation industry.
They include a $927 million EETC from International Airlines Group, bonds totalling in excess of $1 billion 
associated with Emirates Airlines, a $636 million asset-backed security from lessor Avolon, debt instruments with a 
value of $12.7 billion, while the ISE is also home to equity listings for Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
The ISE says it has worked closely with Enterprise Ireland's Aviation Forum, as well as stockbroking firms and 
aircraft leasing companies, on plans for the exchange.
ISE chief executive Deirdre Somers says the dedicated exchange will provide issuers and investors with what they 
are looking for "visibility and specialist knowledge of their sector".
"Ireland is home to more than 30 companies engaged in this high-value, high-skilled sector. It is also home to two of 
Europe's best-known airlines in Ryanair and Aer Lingus. Investors and issuers around the world are familiar with 
Ireland's expertise in aviation and it makes sense to build on that," says Somers.
The initiative has drawn support from all corners of the industry, including Boeing Capital's Kostya Zolotusky, 
Goodbody Stockbrokers director Joe Gill, Irish Aviation Authority chief executive Eamonn Brennan and Tom 
Woods, head of Aviation Finance and Leasing at KPMG.

Body
The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) has announced it will launch a dedicated exchange for aviation finance.
The ISE says it has made the announcement in the lead-up to this week's 16th Annual Global Airfinance 
Conference in Dublin, which over 1000 senior aviation executives will attend.
The ISE says it has worked closely with Enterprise Ireland's Aviation Forum, as well as stockbroking firms and 
aircraft leasing companies, on plans for the exchange. Sources at the exchange state a formal launch of the 
aviation exchange is planned later in this quarter.
"It is a statement of intent that the Irish Stock Exchange is open to discussing ways and means of using its various 
platforms to support aviation finance," comments Goodbody Stockbrokers director Joe Gill.
"What the ISE is saying If people in the aviation industry want to come up with innovative ideas to support the 
Airfinance community than they are very open to exploring those: using the MSM, or the Global Exchange Market 
(GEM), or using the third market which is the Enterprise Securities Market (ESM). "
The Main Securities Market (MSM) of the Irish Stock Exchange is already used by aviation credits to list bonds.
The ISE says 26 specialist debt instruments, with a total value of $12.7 billion, are currently listed on the Irish 
market by issuers from the aviation industry.
They include a $927 million EETC from International Airlines Group, bonds totalling in excess of $1 billion 
associated with Emirates Airlines, a $636 million asset-backed security from lessor Avolon, debt instruments with a 
value of $12.7 billion, while the ISE is also home to equity listings for Ryanair and Aer Lingus.

Europe's best-known airlines in Ryanair and Aer Lingus. Investors and issuers around the world are familiar with 
Ireland's expertise in aviation and it makes sense to build on that," says Somers.
Update: Irish Stock Exchange to launch aviation exchange
The initiative has drawn support from all corners of the industry, including Boeing Capital's Kostya Zolotusky, Irish 
Aviation Authority chief executive Eamonn Brennan and Tom Woods, head of Aviation Finance and Leasing at 
KPMG.
Speaking to Airfinance Journal Zolotusky adds: "With such great concentration of lessor talent in Ireland, it is bound 
to be an important area of innovation in capital markets products that securitize aircraft portfolios and create a 
broader opportunity for lessors to sell down their aircraft."
The Irish government has been keen to support publicly listed Irish companies as a means to generate jobs. In its 
latest budget in October 2013 it decided to scrap the 1% stamp duty on the transfer of shares of companies on the 
ESM.
The rise of aircraft REITS or AVITS
The exchange may be the first step to create new publicly traded debt and equity instruments for aviation credits. 
Over the last 18 months the Irish government and the stock exchange have helped develop a new domestic Irish 
market for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS). REITS are companies that own or invest in real estate through 
properties or mortgages. Often publicly traded, they allow institutional and retail investors' access to hard assets 
while avoiding the initial capital outlay. Typically conservatively geared they deliver annual cash dividends.
Under the October 2013 Budget the Irish government adapted its legislation to recognise REITS.
Market sources say the work that the Irish government has put into REITS could be the first step into creating 
Aircraft or Aviation Investment Trusts (AVITs), a product which does not yet exist. Brokers state that the new 
aviation exchange could help prompt the creation of new financing vehicles and structures.
Gill adds: "REITS were introduced to allow mainstream retail and institutional investors to get access to long life 
assets without having to own those assets directly. They have been a huge success in the real estate market and 
the idea is could they apply for a long life asset like aircraft? If they could then maybe Dublin is the place to do that."

Highlight: Regulator says UK's major airport can only increase prices by inflation minus 1.5%.
Body
The United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has announced it will force the nation's largest airport, 
Heathrow, to cap the amount it charges airlines.
The regulation, which caps any increase in the level of charges at 1.5% below inflation over the next five years, 
have been called "draconian" by Heathrow's CEO Colin Matthews.
But the CAA says passengers will benefit from lower airfares as a result of the change.
The latest decision comes after CAA's "Final Proposals" in October suggested allowing prices to rise in line with 
inflation.
However the authority says the newly proposed limit was because passenger traffic forecasts had strengthened 
since October and the cost of capital had been revised.
Also near London, Gatwick Airport's agreement to maintain prices in line with inflation will be monitored by the CAA, 
while Stansted Airport will no longer have its prices regulated.
RyanAir's director of regulatory affairs Juliusz Komorek says the CAA's determination that Stansted did not have 
"substantial market power" was "false".
Other airlines led by British Airways have been reported as asking for Heathrow's charges to be limited to rises of 
inflation minus 9.8%.
Heathrow is able to appeal the CAA's decision.

Europe and US.
Body
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has said his airline will sell 10 euro ($13.66) flights to the United States.
Speaking at the Irish Hotels federation conference yesterday O'Leary was quoted as saying the airline had plans for 
trans-Atlantic flights, but they would not become a reality for several years.
The Irish Independent reported that O'Leary said the plan would have to wait because state-backed Gulf airlines 
were buying up all available aircraft and setting a high market price.
He said the return fares would be $10, but passengers travelling in both directions would pay extra for everything 
including baggage and meals.
"We can make money on 99 cent fares in Europe "" not every seat will be #8364;10 of course, there will also need 
to be a very high number of business or premium seats," The Telegraph quoted O'Leary as saying.
The flights would not operate from Dublin, but from up to 14 European cities to an equivalent number of US 
destinations.

HUNDREDS of flights in France were cancelled yesterday as air traffic control staff across Europe walked out over 
plans to unite the continent's air space.
The French civil aviation authority asked airlines to axe a fifth of flights into Paris airports yesterday, while 
passengers in Italy and Portugal also faced www.disruption.UK services, however, were largely unaffected by the 
industrial action. Heathrow cancelled around a dozen flights while Gatwick reported a handful of delays.
British Airways used larger planes on its services to Paris to accommodate passengers whose flights were 
cancelled, while lowcost carrier Ryanair had to scrap around 80 flights across Europe yesterday.
"After a long and disappointing process where unions and professional representatives have been constantly 
ignored, the promises made by the EC that our views and contributions would be taken on board have come to 
nothing… we have arrived to this stage," said the Air Traffic Controllers European Unions Coordination in a 
statement yesterday.
Air traffic controllers are protesting the European Commission's so-called single sky plan, which will merge some 
national air regulation in the hope of making flight patterns more efficient. The European Parliament is due to vote 
on the new rules in March.
Unions contend that the longawaited changes, first proposed in 1999, will endanger passengers and lead to 10,000 
job losses.

prompted by flight to security on emerging markets fears.
Body
The ISEQ fell again this morning as investors took their cue from a Europe-wide sell off in equities prompted by 
flight to security on emerging markets fears.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 40.61 points to 4,676.12.
Emerging markets led a global sell-off in risky assets today as European stocks followed sharp falls in Asia and 
safe-haven assets such as the yen and gold rallied. Concerns about China's economic slowdown and its shadow 
banking sector, combined with expectations that the Federal Reserve will scale back its bond buying further, are 
piling pressure on emerging markets dependent on external financing. Political risks in Ukraine, Turkey and 
Thailand as well as a looming financial crisis in Argentina are compounding the problem of emerging markets in a 
week when the Fed is expected to cut its monthly bond purchases by another dollar 10 billion. Emerging markets 
experienced a similar synchronised sell-off last May when the Fed initially suggested stimulus wind-down. But this 
time, local factors are playing a bigger role.
Shares in CRH rose 8c to E19.27. Data released on Friday by the American Institute for Architects (AIA) shows that 
the non-residential construction market is now expected to grow by 5.8pc in 2014. Ryanair's stocks dipped 2c to 
E6.64. Core portfolio stock Ryanair is expected to release Q313 results on Monday Feb 3rd. The low cost airline 
remains our favoured play in the airline space for a recovery of yields and earnings, according to Dolmen 
Stockbrokers. "The price war currently being waged by Ryanair, though painful in the short term, is likely to benefit 
shareholders in the longer term, by capping the expansion plans of rivals. In addition, efforts on the company's part 
to improve its public image through customer service and a more user friendly website should also be earnings 
enhancing," the broker said. Aer Lingus shares fell 6c to E1.37.

Without good customers, you don't have a business. The only reason you will have customers is if you offer what 
the customer needs, and then supply it better or cheaper than someone else.
There are low cost value models such as Ryanair who get and keep customers by keeping the price down it's that 
simple. Then there's the luxury or premium models such as The Ballyfin Hotel where price is not as important. The 
model must deliver what it promises or you won't keep the customer. Do you know what your value proposition is? 
When starting out you need to choose the value, provide the value and communicate the value to the target market.
You need to develop understanding of your customer and what is important to them and how you can help them do 
their job or fulfil a need.
Continuously refine your business processes to make it easier for your customers to do their jobs. You need to 
intertwine your business into your customers business, the borderless business model it's called.
Target the right customer. Measure your profitability by customer, and find out which customers are making you 
money and which are not, and then take the necessary action.
Satisfied customers are normally the best source of referrals, so what are you doing to generate referrals from your 
customer base?
Feargal Quinn devotes a full chapter of his book Crowning The Customer to the subject of how to generate 
complaints.
This might seem a bit unusual, but it was critical to him in building his business empire. His philosophy was to find 
the unhappiness and deal with it positively, so then you have more satisfied customers than before.
A key element of market knowledge is competitor knowledge. Continually review what your competitors are doing, 
what they are doing better than you, worse than you or differently to you.
Your Business: How to hold onto your customers
An awareness and understanding of competitor activity and aspirations can help clarify one's own market position. 
Competitors can be good teachers, as well as good motivators.

Low-cost airline easyJet warned yesterday that the late timing of Easter would weigh on results in the first half of its 
financial year even as it reported a strong growth in revenues.
The Luton-based airline carried 4 per cent more passengers in the last three months of 2013, and its shift to 
allocated seating helped it make 1.4 per cent more on each seat in constant currency. Revenues increased 7.7 per 
cent to £897m in its first quarter, compared with the same period the previous year.
The share price fell 3.4 per cent to £16.83p, due to profit-taking and to the update being the first without an upgrade 
for a while.
The growth follows a strong year last year, during which it outperformed rival carrier Ryanair and delivered a £175m 
special dividend to shareholders.
EasyJet predicted that as Easter would come in April its pre-tax loss would be between £70m and £90m in the first 
half of its financial year, assuming there was no unusual disruption.
Last year Easter fell earlier, boosting its first-half earnings by £25m. It had a £61m loss in that period.
Over the summer, easyJet agreed a deal to order 135 A320 Airbus aircraft, with an option to take 100 more. Higher 
airport charges at regulated airports also added to its increased costs.
EasyJet warning despite strong revenue growth TRAVEL & LEISURE
The consensus forecast for easyJet's full-year profit before tax is £540m; it made £478m in its last full-year 
earnings.
Because of disruption such as the power outage at Gatwick, air traffic strikes and bad weather, easyJet cancelled 
360 flights in the three months to the end of the year, up from 64 the previous year.

EasyJet's success in attracting cost-conscious business travellers helped the no-frills British airline to report a 7.7 
percent rise in first-quarter revenue, though it warned the timing of Easter would hit first-half results overall.
Shares in Europe's second-biggest budget airline by passenger numbers, which have doubled in value over the 
past year, slipped as much as 3.6 percent today.
"The negative is that it's exactly as people expected it to be," said Panmure analyst Gert Zonneveld of the results.
"Given the shares have had a phenonmenal run, you would expect a bit of profit-taking." EasyJet has stolen a 
march on bigger rival Ryanair by introducing measures such as allocated seating and allowing passengers to 
change their flights in a bid to appeal to business travellers. While easyJet posted a 51 percent rise in profit in its 
2012-13 financial year and announced plans for a special dividend for shareholders, Ryanair cut its annual profit 
target twice in two months late last year. EasyJet said today that business passenger numbers rose 8.9 percent in 
the three months ended Dec. 31, the first quarter of its financial year, more than double the 4.2 percent rise in 
overall passengers. However, the Luton, England-based firm said the timing of Easter, which this year falls in April 
and so outside the first half of its financial year, would hit revenues in the six months to March 31. In the first half of 
last year, revenues got a 25-million-pound (dollar 41.5 million) boost from Easter, it estimated. As a result the 
group, which traditionally sees fewer customers fly over the winter season, expects a first-half loss of between 70 
million pounds and 90 million pounds, more than the 61 million pounds loss in the same period last year. "EasyJet 
has made a good start to the year. The performance in the quarter demonstrates our continued focus on cost, 
progress against our strategic priorities and easyJet's structural advantage in the European short-haul market," 
chief executive Carolyn McCall said in a statement. A focus on costs would help the company continue to deliver 
sustainable growth, it said, adding it expected first-half revenue per seat to rise slightly on the prior period. EasyJet 
EasyJet revenues up 7.7pc in 1st quarter EasyJet Revenue
said its first-quarter revenue rose 7.7 percent year-on-year to 897 million pounds. While in line with expectations, 
Richard Hunter, head of equities at brokers Hargreaves Landsdown, said the update did not match the "great 
expectations" to which easyJet investors had become accustomed. At 1055 GMT, easyJet shares were down 2.8 
percent at 1,694 pence, valuing the business at about 6.7 billion pounds. Ryanair, which is in the midst of a drive 
aimed at improving its image and wooing business travellers, is due to report its third-quarter results on Feb. 3.

The ISEQ's latest rally came to an abrupt end today as investors took profits amid unease over the latest world 
economy data.
At the close, the ISEQ was down 38.53 points to 4,815.08.
U.S. stocks and global emerging markets sold off sharply on disappointing Chinese manufacturing data and weak 
company earnings, while the euro rose against the dollar after encouraging survey results on the euro zone's 
private sector. European shares backed away from their lofty multi-year highs hit earlier in the week as caution set 
in over global growth trends.
easyJet has this morning reported a Q114 IMS which has shown strong revenue growth offset by higher costs. 
Total revenue per seat (RPS) was up 3.4pc to £55.7 and up 1.4pc to £54.6 at constant currency. This compares to 
our estimate of 1.5pc and was driven by allocated seating (1/3 of the increase) and robust late sales. As expected, 
trading through December was very strong relative to October and November. Non-seat revenue increased by 8p to 
88p per seat. Ryanair shares fell 4c to E6.84.

Ryanair today said that it has struck a deal to make its fares available via Google Flight Search, in a move some 
say will completely change the way we search for and buy flights.
Users in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Holland, Spain, Canada and US will be able to find and compare flights to 
and from 186 airports in Europe and North Africa, view prices in their local currency and book direct with the budget 
carrier.
"Ryanair is pleased to announce our partnership with Google Flight Search which will dramatically change how 
Europe's passengers select and book their flights. Customers can now view Ryanair's lowest fares on Google Flight 
Search, browsing by country, date or flight duration and can book these low fares directly on Ryanair.com through 
Google Flight Search. This is the latest digital innovation we have rolled out and will be followed in early 2014 by 
mobile boarding passes, an improved app and a brand new Ryanair.com website," said CEO Michael O'Leary.
Reports earlier this month said that Ryanair's deal with Google will cost the Irish airline nothing. "Because Google, 
being Google, want to show all of the prices from all of the airlines on display. They don't want to charge us, they 
make all of their money out of advertising," said Mr O'Leary. "They don't want to have a limited or biased search. 
They want to be able to say they've screened all of these airlines on all of the routes. They need to find who has got 
the lowest airfare on these routes... and that's us." Google's David Robles said that research suggests that users 
tend to visit around twenty different sites before they book a flight. "Google wants to help improve the travel 
experience by drastically reducing the time wasted on researching and booking flights. Google Flight Search is fast, 
easy to use and interactive so business people, parents, and star crossed lovers can quickly pay for their travel and 
get back to their work, parenting or pining. We want to give users as many flight options as possible, so introducing 
Ryanair, which is Europe's largest airline, to the Google Flight Search family is very exciting," he said.

"Ryanair is pleased to announce our partnership with Google Flight Search which will dramatically change how 
Europe's passengers select and book their flights. Customers can now view Ryanair's lowest fares on Google Flight 
Search, browsing by country, date or flight duration and can book these low fares directly on Ryanair.com through 
Google Flight Search. This is the latest digital innovation we have rolled out and will be followed in early 2014 by 
mobile boarding passes, an improved app and a brand new Ryanair.com website," said CEO Michael O'Leary.
Reports earlier this month said that Ryanair's deal with Google will cost the Irish airline nothing. "Because Google, 
being Google, want to show all of the prices from all of the airlines on display. They don't want to charge us, they 
make all of their money out of advertising," said Mr O'Leary. "They don't want to have a limited or biased search. 
They want to be able to say they've screened all of these airlines on all of the routes. They need to find who has got 
the lowest airfare on these routes... and that's us." Google's David Robles said that research suggests that users 
tend to visit around twenty different sites before they book a flight. "Google wants to help improve the travel 
experience by drastically reducing the time wasted on researching and booking flights. Google Flight Search is fast, 
easy to use and interactive so business people, parents, and star crossed lovers can quickly pay for their travel and 
get back to their work, parenting or pining. We want to give users as many flight options as possible, so introducing 
Ryanair, which is Europe's largest airline, to the Google Flight Search family is very exciting," he said.

THIS year, Ryanair is changing. At least that's what the budget airline's boss, Michael O'Leary, claims in a new TV 
advert, which is part of multi-pronged marketing effort to convince consumers that it is turning over a new leaf.
To get out the message that it is now a kinder, gentler company, it has appointed a chief marketing officer, is 
running ads on the London Underground, and will host weekly Twitter chats with customers.
It is also rolling out a slew of new initiatives to make flying Ryanair more pleasant, including a new website, mobile 
boarding passes, and - perhaps in an effort to steal some of EasyJet's thunder - allocated seating.
Using our social media analysis tool, SoMA, we can see Twitter users' reactions to the company's efforts, and most 
were sceptical: "Michael O'Leary ad says Ryanair will make your flight more enjoyable, kinda sounds like a threat to 
me," said one. "Ryanair takes to Twitter to acknowledge existence of human beings," quipped another.
The social media reaction illustrates the uphill battle the brand still faces to improve its image. However, looking at 
Ryanair's Index score (a composite of six key image attributes), there has been a consistent improvement in 
several markets since the customer service push was launched last autumn.
In Britain, Denmark, Finland and Sweden the brand continues to improve in the eyes of consumers. But in France, 
Germany and Norway people are still not convinced it has truly changed. Furthermore, archrival EasyJet enjoys a 
brand advantage over Ryanair that ranges from considerable to massive in every market where we track the pair.
While Ryanair is still light-years away from being one of Britain's best loved - or indeed, even liked - brands, the 
relatively modest steps it has taken since the end of September have led to a 17 per cent increase in its overall 
Ryanair 's charm offensive starting to win round flyers BRAND INDEX
perception score in the UK. Consumers are not yet fully convinced, but they do appear to be open to the possibility 
that Ryanair really is changing.

IRISH airline Ryanair is considering tapping bond markets directly for the first time, it emerged yesterday.
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers has issued bonds backed by ExIm bank previously, but is in the 
process of seeking a rating to gain direct access to the debt markets.
"We are putting ourselves in a position to allow us access to capital markets. We have done it using US 
government export credit...[but] we haven't raised any money on Ryanair's book in debt markets," corporate 
treasurer James Dempsey told Reuters.

The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) has announced plans to create a dedicated exchange for aviation-related debt and 
other instruments.
The exchange will offer a highly efficient, low-cost platform delivering better visibility, greater investor reach and 
improved market intelligence, the ISE said.
The announcement was made ahead of this week's 16th Annual Global Airfinance Conference 2014 in Dublin, a 
major aviation industry event that is being attended by over 1,000 senior aviation executives from around the world.
Already, 26 specialist debt instruments with a total value of dollar 12.7 billion are currently listed on ISE markets by 
issuers from the aviation industry. These include: A dollar 927m EETC from International Airlines Group (the parent 
of BA and Iberia); bonds totalling in excess of dollar 1bn associated with Emirates Airlines; a dollar 636m Asset-
Backed Security from Avolon (a commercial aircraft leasing company) and debt instruments with a total value of 
dollar 12.7 billion. The ISE is also home to equity listings for Ryanair and Aer Lingus The dedicated platform aims to 
be an international hub for aviation finance assets creating a market that will be enhanced by specialist knowledge 
of the industry in Irish-based leasing, broking and corporate finance firms. ISE Chief Executive Deirdre Somers said 
Ireland is a world leader in aviation finance and the Irish Stock Exchange is a world leader in debt listings. "We want 
to combine these skills to make Ireland even more attractive for aviation issuers and investors. We are creating a 
dedicated platform specialising in aviation-related debt instruments that will provide issuers and investors with what 
they are looking for - visibility and specialist knowledge of their sector," she said. Ms Somers said Ireland is already 
the world's biggest centre for aircraft leasing, with more than half of aircraft leasing worldwide led by companies 
based here. "Ireland is home to more than 30 companies engaged in this high-value, high-skilled sector. It is also 
home to two of Europe's best-known airlines in Ryanair and Aer Lingus. Investors and issuers around the world are 
familiar with Ireland's expertise in aviation and it makes sense to build on that," she said.

Ryanair is looking at tapping capital markets directly for the first time as it prepares to take delivery of recently 
ordered Boeing aircraft, a senior executive said today.
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers has raised funds in the past through bonds backed by the U.S. 
government-owned ExIm bank, but is in the process of seeking a rating to gain direct access to the debt markets.
"We are putting ourselves in a position to allow us access to capital markets. We have done it using U.S. 
government export credit...(but) we haven't raised any money on Ryanair's book in debt markets," corporate 
treasurer James Dempsey told Reuters.
Among options on the table, Ryanair is exploring whether to use a rare euro-denominated version of Enhanced 
Equipment Trust Certificates (EETC), a dollar-denominated funding structure popular with U.S. airlines and 
gradually being adopted abroad. "We tend to value our aircraft owned in euros and we are in the euro zone," 
Dempsey said, speaking on the sidelines of an Airline Economics conference in Dublin. "If you take a U.S. capital 
markets product, we have to swap that back (from dollars). So we prefer to raise the money in euros. That is 
something we would be very interested in," he added. So far, only Air France has used euro-denominated EETC 
instruments, conference delegates said. EETCs, a critical source of funding for U.S. carriers, are attractive because 
the planes -- the carrier's main long-term asset -- are put into a special-purpose trust to protect investors in case of 
an airline default or insolvency. Such structures from non-US carriers are more rare. Asked about the timing of a 
possible debt-market debut, Dempsey noted that the first of 175 recently ordered Boeing 737s would not be 
delivered until late this year. Ryanair ordered the current-generation jets last year, taking advantage of attractive 
discounts as Boeing prepares to switch to a more efficient 737 MAX model, due out from 2017. It has however said 
it is interested in ordering the MAX as it seeks to expand passenger numbers by 50 percent by the end of the 
decade. Dempsey declined to comment on those negotiations, but indicated that the airline did not feel under

pressure to make a quick decision due to Boeing's long waiting list. Most 737 MAX production slots are sold out 
until late-decade. "The fact that the (737 MAX) aircraft is coming in 5, 6, 7 years' time makes it a lot easier to say 
that there is only one aircraft available today ... rather than the 13 percent (gain in) efficiency that will come in 
2018," Dempsey told delegates at the conference, part of a week of air finance meetings. Airlines have been 
upgrading to the re-engined 737 MAX or the competing Airbus A320neo amid high fuel prices.

the planes -- the carrier's main long-term asset -- are put into a special-purpose trust to protect investors in case of 
an airline default or insolvency. Such structures from non-US carriers are more rare. Asked about the timing of a 
possible debt-market debut, Dempsey noted that the first of 175 recently ordered Boeing 737s would not be 
delivered until late this year. Ryanair ordered the current-generation jets last year, taking advantage of attractive 
discounts as Boeing prepares to switch to a more efficient 737 MAX model, due out from 2017. It has however said 
it is interested in ordering the MAX as it seeks to expand passenger numbers by 50 percent by the end of the 
decade. Dempsey declined to comment on those negotiations, but indicated that the airline did not feel under

pressure to make a quick decision due to Boeing's long waiting list. Most 737 MAX production slots are sold out 
until late-decade. "The fact that the (737 MAX) aircraft is coming in 5, 6, 7 years' time makes it a lot easier to say 
that there is only one aircraft available today ... rather than the 13 percent (gain in) efficiency that will come in 
2018," Dempsey told delegates at the conference, part of a week of air finance meetings. Airlines have been 
upgrading to the re-engined 737 MAX or the competing Airbus A320neo amid high fuel prices.

Twenty years after the spectacular
collapse of Irish tycoon Tony Ryan's
plane leasing empire, the Emerald Isle
has restored its grip on the world's
aircraft fleet with a mega-merger that
could pave the way for a wave of multi- billion-dollar IPOs. The dollar 5 billion takeover of U.S. leasing giant ILFC by 
AerCap , a firm that emerged from the ruins of Ryan's pioneering Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), is set to send 
ownership of its fleet of 1,000 jets to Shannon, a small town in the west of Ireland where GPA pioneered the plane 
leasing industry in the 1980s. A disastrous bet on an airline boom that was cut short by the Gulf War led to GPA's 
effective collapse in 1993 and an exodus from Shannon. Ryan bounced back to found Ryanair, now Europe's 
largest carrier by passenger numbers, and firms set up by the jet- setting Irishmen he trained have brought 
ownership of about one in four of the world's commercial fleet back to Ireland. "What goes around comes around is 
an expression I could use," said Patrick Blaney, one of the GPA executives who helped restructure the firm after a 
failed initial flotation in 1992 and who still lives nearby. "It leaves me with a warm feeling, for certain." 
Like other executives from the firm who remember how the exuberance of the late 1980s gave way to the airline 
failures of the early 1990s, Blaney sees some warning signs that not all of the world's aviation firms will survive the 
current boom intact. Yet Ireland's rebirth looks set to whet the appetite of aircraft financiers holding their own mini-
Davos gathering in Dublin this week. Their industry is basking in greater market recognition in the wake of the 
purchase of ILFC and is at last supported by robust profits at many airlines after years of restructuring and

adjustment to high oil prices. "This transaction will drive a lot of people to look at the IPO market," said Aengus 
Kelly, Chief Executive of AerCap. "It may encourage people to get involved in this business soon, before the values 
start to move on further." From shaky roots in the 1970s, leasing has become a dominant force in aviation, with 
aircraft portfolios at leading firms worth an estimated dollar 200 billion. The industry is credited with making air 
travel cheaper and safer. Operating leases allow airlines to avoid huge capital costs and rent a modern jetliner, 
potentially worth dollar 40-50 million at market prices, with all the latest equipment. A mid-level executive from 
Ireland's national airline Aer Lingus in the mid- 1970s, Ryan, who died in 2007, spotted the same opportunity as his 
great rival ILFC founder Steven Udvar-Hazy in California. When Ryan was tasked with finding a home for a 
mothballed Aer Lingus Boeing 747 during the winter months, he flew around the world until Thailand's Air Siam 
agreed to take it. He quickly realised serious money could be made by financing and operating planes for other 
airlines. After founding GPA in 1975, he surrounded himself with a team of ambitious young executives who 
travelled hundreds of thousands of miles a year - occasionally dipping behind the Iron curtain - to match parked 
planes and expanding airlines. At weekends they would retire to their country piles near the Shannon estuary, a key 
refuelling spot for transatlantic planes from the 1930s to 1960s, where locals suffering from the 1980s recession 
looked on in awe. "They had more money than anyone in the town had ever seen," said the manager of the nearby 
Dromoland Castle Hotel, Mark Nolan, who remembers struggling to meet the demands of his "spoiled, opulent" 
clientele. "But it all dried up pretty quickly," he said. The good times ended when the first Gulf War hit the industry 
and torpedoed Ryan's attempted IPO, leaving him with dollar 17 billion in orders and not enough capital to fund 
them. "He over-reached himself," said Christopher Brown, author of "Crash Landing", an inside account of how 
GPA crumbled. "He bought too many aircraft and didn't realise the cycle was turning until it was far too late to get 
out of the hole." Just before turbulence hit, ILFC managed to sell itself to insurance giant AIG, guaranteeing it a 
steady flow of cheap funding, until it was laid low by the 2008 financial crisis, which froze its access to unsecured 
market financing. While Ryan was ruined, until Ryanair rebuilt his fortune, some executives joined the two entities 
that split from GPA, and others set up by themselves. GECAS, built by General Electric on about 60 percent of 
GPA's fleet and 75 percent of its people, went on to become the world's largest lessor, with most of its 1,700 planes 
owned and still managed from its Shannon office. Other executives played a key role in the rise of several of the top 
10 lessors, including SMBC Aviation Capital, Babcock and Brown Aircraft Management and AerCap, now the 
industry number two. "Ireland is the centre of air leasing in the world, and that came from GPA. The seeds were 
sown," said Kelly, whose company AerCap acquired what was left of GPA after its carve-up. As AIG desperately 
searched for an owner for its leasing unit last year, Kelly stepped up again, orchestrating a merger with AerCap and 
bringing ILFC under what is left of GPA. While AerCap's corporate headquarters is in the Netherlands, it manages 
its fleet in Ireland, which remains the industry hub, thanks to what many say is an unrivalled web of international tax 
agreements, a low corporate tax rate and world-leading aviation financing expertise. The deal, which is due to close 
in May, will create a listed company with a market cap likely around dollar 8 billion, hugely expanding the volume of 
publicly traded shares in the sector. "This is a transformative transaction. It shows for the first time that large- scale 
consolidation is possible, and it should make the public market more attractive," said Domhnal Slattery, who started 
his career in GPA and now manages 182 planes at privately owned Dublin-based lessor Avolon. However, another 
wave of record aircraft orders and the bulging backlogs of leading planemakers Airbus and Boeing, have renewed 
fears that the industry is over-extending itself, just as it did in the late 1980s. Airbus and Boeing have announced 
record combined orders for more than 3,000 passenger jets in 2013, and the waiting list for new jets is as long as 
nine years on average, a headache for buyers unable to finance commitments so far in the future. At the same time, 
manufacturers are vying to increase output, raising fears of overproduction, a double headache for lessors who are 
chasing the same airlines and also depend on healthy second-hand prices in order to preserve the underlying value 
of their assets. Still, most forecasters in the industry say the economic picture has changed for the better. China 
and emerging markets have spurred demand that did not exist in Ryan's day, and air travel is expanding to serve a 
new Asian middle class. The bruises and knocks still felt by GPA veterans may, in theory, have led to a more 
mature, less gung-ho industry. Executives say many of the checks and balances were brought to the industry by 
GECAS, which married financial portfolio skills with the international reach and customer focus of the old GPA. 
"What GPA did not have, which is an integral part of most leasing companies today, is a deep-rooted system of risk 
management," said Slattery, who started at GPA and then GECAS. "It was an entrepreneurial, opportunistic, go-go

It's not every day that a major listed company announces nine senior appointments simultaneously. That sort of 
change at the top is so extraordinary that it took even the disastrous Irish banks several years to accomplish a clear 
out of pre-crash senior management.
But Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is not just anybody. And he's certainly no banker. The iconic head of 
Europe's biggest airline made a series of changes to his operations and marketing teams last Friday, the most 
noteworthy of which was the appointment of Kenny Jacobs as chief marketing officer. Jacobs held the same role for 
Moneysupermarket and also served in senior roles for Tesco in Ireland and Britain. The impending departure of 
O'Leary's deputy and chief operating officer, Michael Cawley, has set off a domino run of promotions.
But there is something deeper at work than just personnel turnover. Ryanair is going through a kind of rebirth, with 
highly publicised moves to soften its public image as well as concessions on customer service that O'Leary would 
have scoffed at just a few years ago. Things have clearly changed. Ryanair issued its first profit warning in a 
decade last March, which appears to have rattled the otherwise cocksure chief executive. Price cuts are not yielding 
the volumes they used to; cost cuts appear to be reaching their limits. Moreover, Ryanair's many imitators have 
started closing the distance.
So O'Leary is flipping the script. He's now doing group and business bookings . He's hooking up with Google and 
decluttering the website. Even baggage restrictions have been relaxed. At some point, everybody has to grow up. 
Jacobs, young as he is at 40, looks as if he'll be key to this transformation.

**The real test of Ireland's rating**
There was a lot of hand-wringing and agonising over whether ratings agency Moody's would finally upgrade 
Ireland's credit rating last week and join S&P and Fitch in the global celebration of the country's return from its near-
Ex Post Facto: Behind the stories
death brush with national bankruptcy. In the event, Moody's not only upgraded the rating, but also the outlook, 
indicating another upgrade may be on the way. But how much does Moody's approval really matter?
Surely at this point it amounts to a formal exercise that validates what the market has already decided: Ireland is no 
longer junk, but a moderate investment risk. Ironically, Moody's was a leader in market implied' ratings just before 
the crash of September 2008.
The agency devised a system for deriving a rating from actual bond prices to give clients a sense of how the 
market's judgment would translate into its hierarchical measurement system. One infamous victim was Irish 
Nationwide. The building society was on investment grade as late as August 2008, but the bond markets were wise 
to the looming disaster. Some of the bonds were trading at yields above 30 per cent. Moody's duly noted this 
implied a rating eight notches below the formal grade - and deep into junk territory.
The real test of Ireland's rating - whether with the agencies or real investors - will come when big holders of Irish 
debt such as Franklin Templeton's Michael Hasenstab start taking profits from their in the money positions. 
Hasenstab has a position worth close to Euro 10 billion. When he decides the run is over, he'll start selling. Then 
we'll see what kind of yields bring in new buyers.

Company: Shannon Airport
**Done deal:**1.4 million passenger through-put in 2013The clincher: From here on, we are in growth mode and 
have a very solid platform laid thanks to the advances made in 2013, but particularly the new routes secured that 
are now in place for 2014.'' **Rose Hynes,**chairwoman, Shannon Airport.
.....
Shannon Airport stemmed a five-year decline in passenger numbers in 2013, its first year as an independe nt entity, 
new figures have shown.
Some 1.4 million passengers passed through the airport last year, up marginally on the 2012's 1.39 million figure. 
Shannon launched new transatlantic routes in 2013 to Chicago and Philadelphia, along with a new British service to 
Liverpool and European services to Alicante, Faro and Lanzarote
''2013 was always going to be challenging, not least at the beginning of the year as we emerged from the state 
airports group,'' said Neil Pakey, CEO, Shannon Airport.
''After a slow start in terms of passenger numbers over the first five months, trends improved considerably as the 
year drew on and the second half of the year was very positive.''
The airport's chairman Rose Hynes said new services due to launch this year would include eight Ryanair routes to 
Berlin, Paris, Fuerteventura, Warsaw, Faro, Munich, Nice and Krakow.
Aer Lingus Regional will start new daily services to Boston, JKF New York and Bristol. It will increase its 
Manchester service from twice to three times daily and add a second daily service to Birmingham. United Airlines 
will increase capacity on its Shannon-Chicago service, with the addition of 90 flights.
Shannon Airport in growth mode'
''From here on, we are in growth mode and have a very solid platform laid thanks to the advances made in 2013, 
but particularly the new routes secured that are now in place for 2014. We achieved our stated objectives for 2013 
regarding passenger numbers and increased connectivity,'' said Hynes.

Body
The National Asset Management Agency has been successful in 89 of the 90 completed legal cases in which it has 
been involved since it was set up in December 2009.
In response to questions from The Irish Times, Nama confirmed yesterday it has succeeded in the 60 legal cases 
that it has initiated to date and that have been completed.
In addition, Nama has succeeded in 14 of the 15 completed cases that have been taken against the State agency. 
In a case involving property developer Paddy McKillen, Nama was "partially unsuccessful".
In total, 31 actions have been initiated against Nama, with 16 still active.
Nama has instigated 117 sets of legal proceedings. Of that number, 60 are complete, with 57 going through the 
courts. Nama has also been involved in 26 appeal cases. It has been successful in all 13 completed cases while the 
remaining "post-judgment" actions are ongoing. The Irish Times XXXX A consortium backed by French giant, 
Bouygues, looks poised to take over troubled building group, Siac, after the original preferred bidder for the 
company, businessman Brian Harvey, decided against going ahead with an offer. The High Court appointed 
Michael McAteer of Grant Thornton as examiner to Siac Construction and eight related companies late last year, 
giving them protection from creditors, including three banks owed E42 million. It is understood that a consortium 
made up of French group, Bouygues and involving Siac's owners, the Feighery family, is likely to take the business 
out of examinership this month at a cost of between E12 million and E13 million. The move is likely to secure the 
group's core construction and engineering contracting operations and the 200-plus jobs that they support. The 
Feighery family will have a minority holding in the rescued business. The consortium is also said to involve Siac's 
former chief executive, Finn Lyden. The Irish Times XXXX Aventas Group, the renamed former Quinn Group of 
companies, is to invest E16 million in its Quinn Cement plant in Co Cavan. Aventas said it has appointed 
Roundup-NAMA wins legal battles News Roundup
contractors PJ Carey to convert the landmark cement plant which towers 90m over the town of Ballyconnell, to use 
solid recovered fuel. About 100 construction jobs will be created in the conversion. The investment is part of an 
overall spend of between E30 million and E50 million which Aventas plans to make in upgrading and maintaining 
the plant over the next five years. Aventas is 75 per cent owned by its former creditors - mainly banks and hedge 
funds - with the remainder held by its principal former lender, Irish Bank Resolution Corporation. The Irish Times 
XXXX Ryanair will launch a new service for business travellers in the coming weeks. The carrier also said 
yesterday that it had appointed Lesley Kane as its new head of groups and corporate travel. She was previously 
head of European sales and marketing at the airline. Ryanair is in the process of reinventing itself as it tries to lure 
more families and corporate travellers. The airline's boss, Michael O'Leary, said in November that the new business

The ISEQ's New Year rally resumed today with the index breaking through the 4,800 mark for the first time since 
2008.
The index rose 34.38 points to 4,817.42.
European shares rose to fresh 5-1/2 year highs, buoyed by a better global growth outlook from the World Bank, with 
gains supported by easing regulatory concerns over banks in the euro zone. Euro zone banks gained 1.3 percent, 
the top sectoral riser, after the European Central Bank said lenders will not be required in upcoming stress tests to 
adjust sovereign debt portfolios they hold to maturity to reflect current market values.
Airline industry body IATA expects 2014 to be a record year of profitability. This has been led by the US, where 
consolidation is at a much more advanced stage than elsewhere. In Europe, low-cost carriers (LCCs) are back on 
the growth path and legacy airlines are in significant restructuring mode. However, with some capacity growth 
returning to the market, profits will be driven more by volumes and efficiencies. 2014 is the year when restructuring 
programmes will need to start delivering, Davy Research noted. Shares in Ryanair climbed 10c to E6.64 while Aer 
Lingus rose 5c to E1.49. "Ryanair (market position, balance sheet/cash flows, product improvements, easy 
comparables in 2014) and Lufthansa (restructuring/cost initiatives, balance sheet strength, valuation, aviation leader 
in related businesses - MRO, cargo) are our top picks," the broker said. Britany Ferries has announced an order for 
a new ship costing E270m to enter service in late spring 2017. While operating on longer routes between the UK 
and Spain, it may also service the Cork-Roscoff Irish-French route. Shares in Irish Continental Group fell 43c to 
E28.21.

By 12:30, the index was up 27.44 points to 4,810.48.
European shares rose to fresh 5-1/2 year highs, buoyed by a better global growth outlook from the World Bank, with 
gains supported by easing regulatory concerns over banks in the euro zone. Euro zone banks gained 1.3 percent, 
the top sectoral riser, after the European Central Bank said lenders will not be required in upcoming stress tests to 
adjust sovereign debt portfolios they hold to maturity to reflect current market values.
Airline industry body IATA expects 2014 to be a record year of profitability. This has been led by the US, where 
consolidation is at a much more advanced stage than elsewhere. In Europe, low-cost carriers (LCCs) are back on 
the growth path and legacy airlines are in significant restructuring mode. However, with some capacity growth 
returning to the market, profits will be driven more by volumes and efficiencies. 2014 is the year when restructuring 
programmes will need to start delivering, Davy Research noted. Shares in Ryanair climbed 11c to E6.65 while Aer 
Lingus rose 2c to E1.46. "Ryanair (market position, balance sheet/cash flows, product improvements, easy 
comparables in 2014) and Lufthansa (restructuring/cost initiatives, balance sheet strength, valuation, aviation leader 
in related businesses - MRO, cargo) are our top picks," the broker said. Britany Ferries has announced an order for 
a new ship costing E270m to enter service in late spring 2017. While operating on longer routes between the UK 
and Spain, it may also service the Cork-Roscoff Irish-French route. Shares in Irish Continental Group fell 5c to 
E28.59.

Shannon Airport has stemmed a five-year decline in passenger numbers in its first year as an independent entity, 
passenger figures for 2013 confirm.
Some 1,400,032 passengers flew through Shannon over the course of the year, up from 1,394,781 in 2012.
The marginal increase was achieved despite a difficult start to 2013 as month-over-month passenger numbers 
again decreased in the months through to June when the airport recorded its first month-over-month increase in five 
years.
The increase in the latter half of the year was most pronounced on transatlantic routes where 22pc growth was 
achieved, thanks to new services to Chicago and Philadelphia. UK/European routes were also boosted by new 
services during 2013, to Alicante, Faro, Lanzarote and Liverpool. "2013 was always going to be challenging, not 
least at the beginning of the year as we emerged from the State airports group. After a slow start in terms of 
passenger numbers over the first five months, trends improved considerably as the year drew on and the second 
half of the year was very positive. We are very confident that we will now achieve real growth as we move into 2014 
and beyond," said Shannon Group plc CEO Neil Pakey: Its Chairman Rose Hynes predicted that growth will be 
accelerated in 2014 from March onwards when services at the airport will be significantly enhanced. This will arise 
as Ryanair commences eight new routes - to Berlin, Paris, Fuerteventura, Warsaw, Faro, Munich, Nice and Krakow 
- and Aer Lingus Regional starts its new daily Bristol service, increases Manchester from twice to three daily 
frequencies and doubles the existing Birmingham single daily service. 2014 will also see Aer Lingus fly daily on its 
Boston and JKF New York services while United Airlines will increase its capacity on the Shannon-Chicago service 
by 88pc as it puts on an additional 90 flights this year. "The target of the independent Shannon Airport at the start of 
the year was to halt the decline in passenger numbers and we have achieved that," said Ms Hynes. "From here on 
we are in growth mode and have a very solid platform laid thanks to the advances made in 2013 but particularly the 
Shannon stems 5-year passenger decline Shannon PAX
new routes secured that are now in place for 2014." "We achieved our stated objectives for 2013 regarding 
passenger numbers and increased connectivity. This is a significant achievement and I would like to pay tribute to 
Neil Pakey and his team for their commitment and hard work. We are now working on many initiatives for 2014 
which we hope will bring further success."

Stansted is back in growth for first time since the recession

STANSTED Airport has returned to growth last year for the first time since the recession, with annual traffic up 2.2 
per cent to 17.8m passengers.
The airport said yesterday it took 1.3m passengers in December, up 7.7 per cent on the previous year and the 
fourth consecutive month of rising traff ic.
Manchester Airports Group bought Stansted from Heathrow owner BAA for £1.5bn last year, following a competition 
commission ruling. The airport focuses on short haul travel to Europe but hopes to attract longhaul carriers as part 
of MAG's growth plans.
"December's traffic results are a clear indication that Stansted is back and successfully competing with other 
London airports," said managing director Andrew Harrison.
"We now expect the airport to enter a period of sustained growth this year following the signing of long-term 
agreements with both Ryanair and EasyJet.
"[There] are real signs of change after years of declining traffic. With the centre of London's economy shifting 
eastwards, we're determined to maximise Stansted's potential to drive economic growth and boost the 
competitiveness of London and the east of England."
While the airport has not been shortlisted by the government's aviation commission as a possible site for a new 
runway, Stansted has plenty of space to expand.
Stansted is back in growth for first time since the recession
It has the capacity to carry 35m passengers a year using its existing runway. Stansted peaked at almost 24m 
passengers in 2007 but has been in decline since the financial crisis dampened demand for air travel.
Stansted's growth follows record traffic at Gatwick and Heathrow for the last year.

Cameron shelves migration report David Cameron shelved a government report on EU migration, after Theresa 
May, home secretary, failed to provide evidence to support her case for imposing tighter curbs on immigrants. May, 
whose department was responsible for drafting the report, said last month there was "abuse of free movement" and 
that some migrants were attracted by "access to benefits" - although she has struggled to prove her contention that 
limiting EU migration would be good for Britain. Immigration has surged up the political agenda but ministers have 
failed to provide evidence to back claims, repeated by Cameron, that many migrants travel to Britain for generous 
benefits.
Russia ups clout with Hungary loan Moscow is set to lend Budapest (EURO)10bn (£8.32bn) to finance two 
Russian-built reactors at Hungary's only nuclear power plant, in the latest in a series of Russian moves to use its 
energy and financial clout to restore influence in eastern Europe. Moscow announced last month a bailout of 
Ukraine and cut natural gas prices to the country by a third after Kiev spurned an EU deal. Wells Fargo calls bitcoin 
summit Wells Fargo has convened a group of finance executives, virtual currency experts and representatives from 
the US government to discuss "rules of engagement" with bitcoin, amid concern about the money laundering risks 
of the new currency. The ban has expressed an interest in dealing with bitcoin.
Love is in the air Another day, another publicity stunt at Ryanair. The airline has launched a "Love Ryanair" 
competition to capitalise Valentine's Day run up. It has invited couples who "found love with Ryanair" to share their 
story, for the chance to win a dream wedding and to propose on a flight. Toshiba set new pace in nuclear drive 
Aspirations for a new generation of British nuclear power stations were given a boost yesterday when Toshiba 
promised to build a reactor in Sellafield in half the time planned to complete the Hinkley Point nuclear plant. The 
multinational confirmed it had bought a stake in the consortium held by Iberdrola.
Cameron says no blackout danger Britain is in "no danger" of suffering blackouts due to energy shortages, David

Irish budget carrier Ryanair will open bases at Athens and Thessaloniki in April 2014, adding three more aircraft 
and nine new routes to its Greek operations.
Ryanair plans to base two aircraft in Athens, which will be used to add services to Chania, London, Milan, Paphos, 
Rhodes and Thessaloniki.
It will also base a single aircraft at Thessaloniki and open three new routes from the airport: Athens, Pisa and 
Warsaw.
Rapidly expanding Ryanair, which already has a single Greek base at Chania, estimates the openings will add 1.2 
million passengers from Athens per year and a further 1.6 million from Thessaloniki.

Is Hargreaves Lansdown's announcement of its unbundled charging structure the start of a new cleaner era in fund 
investing? I think it probably is.
Hargreaves has hacked into its legendary profit margins to provide some investors with a combined fund and 
platform charge of just under 1% a year. It's a big improvement on what went before.
But don't be too seduced by the headline figures: there's also some Ryanair-style hidden charges lurking in today's 
announcement. For a rundown of all the changes, watch my video above.

Passenger numbers at Dublin Airport increased by 6pc to 20.2 million last year as an extra 1.1 million people used 
the airport.
Growth was led by a record-breaking performance on transatlantic traffic, which saw a 13pc increase during 2013.
As a result of the strong growth in passenger numbers, Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) is paying a E5.6 million 
rebate in airport charges to a total of 40 airlines that increased their business at Dublin Airport during 2013, it said 
today.
"Dublin Airport had an excellent performance last year," said Dublin Airport Managing Director, Vincent Harrison. 
"Passenger numbers increased across all areas of the business and Dublin Airport's growth outperformed the 
European average in every month of 2013." Mr Harrison said the performance of the transatlantic market was 
particularly pleasing last year. "We saw a record 1.9 million people flying between Dublin and North America last 
year, as our airline customers added extra capacity to existing routes and we also saw the start of a new daily 
American Airlines service to JFK in New York." Long-haul traffic to the Middle East grew by just over 13pc last year 
and passenger numbers travelling to and from Dublin Airport's largest markets of Europe and the UK also 
increased. Transfer traffic saw strong growth during 2013, as transfer passengers increased by 36pc to almost 
550,000. Last year was Dublin Airport's third successive year of growth and the airport's busiest year since 2009. 
This year is expected to bring further growth, according to Mr Harrison. "We're very positive about 2014, as we 
already have 16 new services scheduled and significant expansions of some existing services have also been 
announced." Aer Lingus is launching services to San Francisco, Toronto, Hanover and Pula, Ryanair will have nine 
new services including Lisbon, Prague, Bucharest, Basel, Marrakech, and Almeria, Canadian airline WestJet will 
have a new route from Dublin to St John's, Newfoundland, and Air Canada rouge will operate its new Dublin-
Toronto service. Under its Growth Incentive Scheme, which has operated since 2011, DAA pays an airport charges 
Dub Airport passengers up 6pc to 20.2m Dublin Airport
rebate to each airline that increases its passenger numbers at Dublin during the year. Airlines that increased 
passenger numbers at Dublin Airport last year and are being paid rebates under the scheme include; Aer Arann, 
Aer Lingus, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta, Lufthansa, Norwegian, Turkish Airlines, Ryanair, SAS, Tarom, 
and United. This is the third successive year of Growth Scheme payments at Dublin Airport and during that period, 
DAA has rebated a total of E8.6 million in airport charges to its airline customers. "This incentive scheme was 
designed to encourage growth in passenger numbers and we are delighted to have paid a rebate in each of the 
three years it has operated," Mr Harrison said. DAA has recently decided to renew the Growth Incentive Scheme for 
a further three years up to 2016. The new scheme will apply to all scheduled airlines using Dublin Airport, and will 
operate alongside DAA's existing generous route incentive schemes.

Ryanair pilots under scrutiny by British revenue
Ryanair pilots under scrutiny by British revenue
Sunday Business Post

British revenue authorities have written to Ryanair pilots seeking information about the services they provide, in a 
widening of their probe into how the airline's pilots are hired, and where they pay their taxes.
*The Sunday Business Post*reported last August that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) had sent letters and 
questionnaires to British pilots employed by Ryanair, questioning why they could not find their tax returns or social 
insurance records.
Many Ryanair pilots are not direct employees of the company, but are hired as contractors through a complex 
structure. The pilots are assigned as directors in pre-formed companies, and then subcontract their services.
Brookfield Aviation Limited, a British pilot employment agency, have been one of the main suppliers of contracted 
pilots to the Irish airline in recent years. Ryanair has about 900 pilots based in Britain, and it is understood that 
around 70 to 75 per cent of these are on Brookfield contracts . Last month HMRC wrote to these pilots, and asked 
them a series of questions about the services they have provided to the British employment agency.
In the letter the pilots are asked if they were told'' where their operational base would be, or if they had a choice'' in 
this.
They were asked if they were given a choice with regard to their self employment status, and if that was employed, 
self-employed or a personal limited company.''
The letter also asked how often they invoiced Brookfield Aviation for payment, and whether they were given advice 
on how to include income and expenses on their annual tax returns, or on any taxation matters. They were also 
questioned about whether they were "told which professional advisor to use.''
In an earlier letter in July, sent to a smaller cohort of the airline's pilots - and also seen by this newspaper - the 
recipients were thanked for completion of form CA8421 (an application form for an certificate to show the country in 
Ryanair pilots under scrutiny by British revenue
which you are paying social insurance) and then informed you would appear to be operating in a complex structure 
that is viewed generally by HMRC as an attempted National Insurance [PRSI equivale nt] avoidance scheme.''
One source said that while last month's letter to pilots was separate to July's one, both appeared to be connected in 
an intensification of the investigation process.''
.....
**Backdated tax bills of EUR 40,000' - Ryanair pilots**
One Ryanair pilot, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that he had been employed with the airline under 
Brookfield Aviation, but had to set up a limited Irish company for the purposes of his contract.
The pilot, who has been working with the airline for two years, did not want to reveal his nationality in case of 
identification.
While he pays income tax in Ireland, he is also subject to employer and employee PRSI in Spain - which comes to 
36 per cent - because he is considered to be an employee, in a company he owns.
He said he set up the company with the help of an accountant, chosen from a list of accountants that Brookfield 
provided him with.
When I Google the name of my [Irish limited] company, I can see there are other directors, though when I signed 
the papers for it, these names were not included,'' he said.
Some of these other directors are pilots, and I have no idea who the others are.
Often the limited companies that are formed have three or more pilots in them. I had to comply, and sign the initial 
company documents, or I would not have got my contract.''
My job is a pilot, I fly from A to B and only work for Ryanair.
My training is in the cockpit, and not in business or accounting, but I need to keep checking my emails, and trying to 
find out if I am compliant in the three countries I am connected to.
I have colleagues in Germany and Italy who have received backdated tax bills of EUR 40,000 from the authorities.
This is very stressful, and I am expecting something soon, as more and more countries are looking into this,'' he 
said.

Trade union leaders take long road to key demands

Trade union chiefs plan to hold fire in their campaign to secure some form of collective bargaining or union 
recognition rights after failing to achieve any new legislation during 2013. Last week the Irish Congress of Trades 
Unions (ICTU) said the ball was in the government's court and they did not envisage stepping up their campaign, 
which has become centred on legalistic rights.
For many years union leaders had given a historical hostage to political fortune when they declared their ambition to 
achieve legal rights to compel employers to recognise union representation in the anniversary year of the 1913 
Lockout.
The joint government programme in 2011 declared that ''we will reform the current law on employees' right to 
engage in collective bargaining [the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2011], so as to ensure compliance by the 
State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights''.
A few months later, in June 2011, the Minister for Jobs, Richard Bruton told the D  ¡il that ''there are no proposals in 
the government's legislative programme that would require an employer to recognise a trade union or compel an 
employer to engage in collective bargaining with a union''.
Impact union president Kevin O'Malley was one of many who linked the bargaining issue with the Dublin Lockout 
centenary, but it has come and gone without any legislative move. Last weekend the union activists celebrated the 
close of commemorations in Glasnevin cemetery at the grave of Alicia Brady. She was a striking Jacob's worker 
who died of infection in December 1913 after a bullet fired by a strike-breaker hit her.
Back in 2009, Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore told ICTU delegates that when in government his party would 
''as a matter of priority'' introduce legislation to provide for collective bargaining. He later added the qualification that 
the new collective bargaining rights would be preceded by consultations with the social partners.
Gilmore told the biennial ICTU conference that his party would commit to giving domestic effect to the principles, 
including collective bargaining, enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Trade union leaders take long road to key demands
Social partnership, by then largely discredited, collapsed five months later. The last partnership pay pact, Towards 
2016, when reviewed in late 2008 contained a government pledge to restore the arms-length' bargaining, through 
the Labour Court, contained in the 2001 and 2004 Industrial Relations Amendment Acts.
This half-way house to European-style union recognition rights emerged after a bitter strike at Ryanair in 1997 
involving baggage-handlers, which Siptu lost. Ryanair then succeeded, ten years later, in getting this legislation 
overturned in an appeal to the Supreme Court over Impact-IALPA efforts to secure indirect bargaining for pilots at 
the airline.
Impact then brought a complaint to the UN's International Labour Organisation which issued a report in 2012. Its 
freedom of association committee advised the government to promote ''machinery'' for ''voluntary negotiation'' 
between employers' and workers' ''organisationsâEUR

This year is shaping up to be the busiest ever year in Knock Airport's history with passenger numbers expected to 
exceed 700,000 for the first time.
In 2013, the annual number of passengers using Ireland West Knock reached 665,000 - the second highest traffic 
figures at the airport since it opened in 1986.
The Airport now serves over 25 International destinations and is served by four of Europes biggest airlines Aer 
LIngus, Flybe, Germanwings and Ryanair.
The Gathering provided a major boost for passenger numbers in 2013 particularly from key markets in the UK, Italy 
and Germany. It saw a 7pc increase in traffic on London services; a 23pc increase in traffic from the Italian market 
on Ryanairs Milan service and a 28pc increase in traffic from the German market on Lufthansas Dusseldorf service. 
Flybe celebrated 100,000 passenger milestone at Ireland West Airport Knock on their Birmingham, Edinburgh and 
Manchester services and the Airport won the Social Enterprise Award for Connacht in the Ulster Bank Business 
Achiever Awards. New destinations for 2014 include a new twice weekly service from Eindhoven in Holland which 
commences at the beginning of April. In addition, Ryanair will commence new direct services, three times weekly, to 
Glasgow, starting June 2014, and Kaunas, once weekly, (Lithuania) from next April. Furthermore Ryanair will add 
an additional 60,000 seats on their hugely popular Luton and Stansted services, with new evening departures on 
Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays, to cater for the increasing demand amongst the business and commuter market. 
Starting May 31st 2014, the airport welcomes another of Europes biggest carriers to the airport, Germanwings, 
which is wholly owned by Europe's largest airline, Lufthansa, and will operate direct flights to and from Cologne-
Bonn in Germany every Saturday until the end of October. Connecting services to their expanded network of over 
80 destinations worldwide will also be bookable as part of the new service. From Cologne/Bonn airport the cities of 
Cologne and Bonn are only 15 minutes away with both Dusseldorf and Frankfurt also within 90 minutes drive. In 
Knock expects busiest ever year in 14 Knock Hopes
recent weeks the airport also welcomed the decision by Government to change the policy on Regional airports that 
will see exchequer support for Ireland West Airport Knock extended to 2023. A further positive development in this 
regard was the publication of the Study Group report on the future development and growth options at Ireland West 
Airport Knock in December. Looking forward to 2014, Joe Gilmore, Managing Director at Ireland West Airport Knock 
said: "We are delighted to have had another strong year in 2013 against what continues to be a very challenging 
environment in the aviation industry. We are looking forward to the year ahead being the busiest year in the airports 
history with four new services being launched, extra capacity on our key London services and the Wild Atlantic Way 
project getting underway. We hope the Wild Atlantic Way initiative will be a major tourism success story for the 
region and our continued growth and the addition of new services will be central to its success as Ireland West 
Airport will be the main international Western gateway for the route, which runs from Donegal to West Cork."

This year is shaping up to be the busiest ever year in Knock Airport's history with passenger numbers expected to 
exceed 700,000 for the first time.
In 2013, the annual number of passengers using Ireland West Knock reached 665,000 - the second highest traffic 
figures at the airport since it opened in 1986.
The Airport now serves over 25 International destinations and is served by four of Europes biggest airlines Aer 
LIngus, Flybe, Germanwings and Ryanair.
The Gathering provided a major boost for passenger numbers in 2013 particularly from key markets in the UK, Italy 
and Germany. It saw a 7pc increase in traffic on London services; a 23pc increase in traffic from the Italian market 
on Ryanairs Milan service and a 28pc increase in traffic from the German market on Lufthansas Dusseldorf service. 
Flybe celebrated 100,000 passenger milestone at Ireland West Airport Knock on their Birmingham, Edinburgh and 
Manchester services and the Airport won the Social Enterprise Award for Connacht in the Ulster Bank Business 
Achiever Awards. New destinations for 2014 include a new twice weekly service from Eindhoven in Holland which 
commences at the beginning of April. In addition, Ryanair will commence new direct services, three times weekly, to

Ryanair Criticizes UK CAA's Decision On Stansted Airport - Quick Facts
Ryanair Criticizes UK CAA's Decision On Stansted Airport - Quick Facts
RTT News (United States)
January 10, 2014 Friday

Body
(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) on Friday criticized the UK Civil Aviation 
Authority's claim that Stansted airport does not have substantial market power, and the consequent deregulation of 
Stansted. Ryanair said it condemns the CAA's continuing failure to effectively regulate Stansted.
Against evidence and its own earlier findings, the UK CAA now inexplicably claimed that airlines are able to exert 
buyer power on Stansted in circumstances where Stansted was allowed by the CAA to double its charges in 2007, 
which caused a 5 year 27% traffic collapse at Stansted while Heathrow and Gatwick were growing. Even Easyjet 
moved flights to Southend to avoid Stansted's high charges.
According to Ryanair, Today's deregulation decision by the CAA will allow Stansted to increase charges in future 
and will result in yet more damage to UK consumers and competition. This decision confirms yet again that the 
CAA's regulatory regime is "inadequate", as previously found by the Competition Commission in its 2009 decision 
to break up the BAA airport monopoly.
Earlier today, The UK Civil Aviation Authority has published its final decisions on economic regulation at Heathrow, 
Gatwick and Stansted after April 2014 - with passengers benefiting from lower prices and high service standard.
The CAA said it has therefore assessed the market power of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted (passenger market 
only for Stansted). It has decided passengers would not benefit from further regulation of Stansted, but that 
Heathrow and Gatwick will both require airport licences from April 2014 onwards.
At Heathrow, the CAA's price control decision will see prices fall in real terms by 1.5% per year between 2014 and 
2019 (RPI-1.5%). This has changed from the CAA's Final Proposals published in October, which suggested prices 
rising in line with inflation. The changes have been made as passenger traffic forecasts have strengthened since 
October, and the cost of capital has been revised. This decision places affordability centre-stage, while ensuring 
there is still a supportive environment for capital expenditure (with provision for nearly 3 billion pounds of 
investment).
The CAA said it has completed its assessment for Stansted's passenger market, taking into account the long-term 
contracts the airport now has in place with its main airline customers, and determined that the airport does not have 
substantial market power. This means the airport will not be economically regulated by the CAA from April 2014 
onwards. The CAA noted that it will publish its decision on Stansted's cargo market power before the end of March 
2014.

Ryanair yesterday announced it was winding up the Irish company's main defined benefit pension scheme after 
agreeing to fix its EUR10m deficit.
Europe's largest low-cost airline by revenue said it had reached agreement on the plans with the trustees to the 
scheme "following protracted negotiations".
The windup of Ryanair's Irish defined benefit scheme means that after fixing a deficit calculated at EUR9.7m on 
December 30, its assets will be cashed in.
The 121 members will then have the value of their accrued benefits transferred into the company's defined 
contribution pension fund.
About 200 scheme members who have left Ryanair, but yet to retire, will also have their accrued benefits put into 
the company's defined contribution fund.
They will all have the value of their benefits enhanced by 10 per cent through a EUR2.8m top-up payment made by 
Ryanair.
Howard Millar, Ryanair's finance director, said the "less than 20" pensioners drawing on the defined benefit scheme 
would have annuities bought for them that guaranteed future payments in retirement.

He added the company was winding up the Irish scheme because it was likely that the deficit would increase, partly 
because people are living longer.
Ryanair has not decided what to do with its UK defined benefit pension scheme, which is markedly smaller than the 
Irish equivalent. Mr Millar said 12 Ryanair employees were members of the UK scheme, which also has "less than 
10" pensioners claiming benefits.

THE ARTIST known as #MOL hit Twitter once more yesterday as Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary continued his 
charm offensive, answering customer questions and, er, wearing a red nose. The airline boss greeted his fans with 
his usual stinted text speak tweeting: "MOL here. H nu yr. Luv u all x x x Hope u as excira bout 2014 as me 
#AskRyanair." We are excira Michael, we are.
The outlandish Irishman first appeared on Twitter back in October, a month after he admitted Ryanair needed to 
stop "unnecessarily p*ssing people off." A change of heart or a reaction to the airline's fight to hold off strong-
performing rivals? Yesterday, his new dedication to customer service saw him answering hundreds of questions. 
Some Ryanair related, others ... not.
Highlights included his suggestion for a transport essay title: "Is MOL God or just Jesus," his request that Brad Pitt 
play him in the next Ryanair ad and his response to the question, "what does it take to be a Ryanair pilot?" - "It 
takes brains, talent, skill & good looks.
In other airlines, usually it takes a lobotomy!" Oh and in case you're wondering, O'Leary insisted his Granny knitted 
his hat.

EasyJet, Europe's No 2 discount airline, grew faster than market leader Ryanair last year as Chief Executive Officer 
Carolyn McCall refined its product offering to appeal to a wider range of clients.
EasyJet's passenger count rose by 2.13 million, or 3.6 per cent, to 61.3 million in 2013, the UK carrier said. That 
compares with 2.3 per cent growth at Ireland's Ryanair, which added 1.8 million travelers for a total of 81.4 million.
Under McCall, EasyJet has boosted frequencies on core routes and introduced allocated seating and flexible tickets 
to draw corporate clients. The Luton, England-based airline lifted traffic in the first three months of 2013 even as 
about 80 jets were idled at Ryanair, where CEO Michael O'Leary recently began a campaign to improve standards 
of customer service.
The U.K. company also filled 89.3 percent of available seats on average in 2013, compared with a load factor of 83 
percent at Dublin-based Ryanair, which has its biggest hub at London Stansted airport. Shares of EasyJet doubled 
in value last year to 1,536 pence after a 79 percent gain in 2012. Ryanair rose 32 percent in 2013 after saying back 
in September that it might miss profit goals for the year to March 31, and is up 4.1 percent in 2014 for a value of E9 
billion.

EASYJET carried 3.6 per cent more passengers than it did a year ago in 2013, helping narrow the gap between the 
budget carrier and its larger rival Ryanair. The orangeliveried airline booked in 61.3m customers in 2013, it said 
yesterday.
Traffic in December was up 3.5 per cent at 4.5m, giving FTSE 100-listed EasyJet a strong end to the year despite 
Christmas Eve disruption at Gatwick, where it is the biggest airline.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers, said last week its annual traffic rose two per cent to 
81.4m.
Meanwhile IAG, the parent company of British Airways, said it carried 67.2m passengers last year, up 2.1 per cent 
excluding the effects of takeovers.
British Airways traffic was up 3.9 per cent on a revenue passenger kilometre measure, while its struggling Spanish 
sibling Iberia saw traffic fall 16.5 per cent.
IAG said European travel was up 8.5 per cent, not including its recent acquisition Vueling.
Flights to Africa and Asia proved popular, though traffic to Latin America and the Caribbean was down 11.8 per 
cent.

(RTTNews) - UK-based low-cost airline easyJet Plc (ESYJY.PK, EZJ.L) Tuesday reported increase in passengers 
for the month of December, while load factor remained flat with last year.
The number of passengers, which represents the number of earned seats flown, in December advanced 3.5 
percent to 4.49 million from 4.34 million in the previous year.
Since easyJet is a no-refund airline, earned seats for the company include seats that are flown whether or not the 
passenger turns up. Earned seats also include seats provided for promotional purposes and to staff for business 
travel.
Monthly load factor, which stands for the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available for 
passengers, was 87.9 percent, unchanged from December 2012.
For the preceding month of November, the firm had reported a 3.4 percent growth in passenger numbers, while 
load factor marginally declined from the same month last year.
For the rolling 12 months ended December 2013, passengers improved 3.6 percent to 61.33 million while load 
factor advanced 0.4 percentage points to 89.3 percent.
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) last week said its December-month traffic grew 4 
percent to over 5.0 million passengers, from 4.8 million passengers last year, thanks to its lower fares, easier to use 
website and customer service improvements. During December 2013, load factor remained unchanged from last 
year at 81 percent.
EZJ.L added over 2 percent on Monday to close at 1,597.00 pence.

Lisa Madden has been International Currency Exchange's country manager for Ireland since 2005. ICE provides 
retail foreign exchange services from outlets located in the airports at Dublin, Shannon, Knock and Belfast. The 
company has 96 staff in Ireland and recently launched an online currency service, Click & Collect, which allows 
travellers to reserve foreign currency online for collection at the airport.
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
I have overall responsibility for the operation of all ICE outlets in Ireland and Northern Ireland, which makes for a 
varied and busy day-to-day role. I am also responsible for strategy and business development for ICE Ireland and 
we recently launched Click & Collect, Ireland's first online currency service. It is a new service, which has been an 
exciting challenge for me professionally.
**What motivates you?**
Travelling through airports can be quite stressful for passengers. This motivates me to ensure my team provides a 
professional, friendly service to our customers.
**How would you describe your work style?**
I have a hands-on approach to management as I strongly believe that working as part of a team is vital for the 
success of the operation.
**What is the most valuable professional lesson you have learned?**
Launching Click & Collect was a steep learning curve for me. I had never dealt with the online market before and 
faced many challenges along the way. I had strong support from our marketing department in Britain and our go-live 
date was a very rewarding experience. I am confident this new service will strengthen our position in Ireland's 
foreign exchange market.
Working Week
**When doing business in Ireland, what do you think is the biggest challenge we face?**
Businesses today are operating in a competitive environment. They have to provide a quality service, while 
ensuring that the cost base for doing so remains viable. The challenge is providing a professional and competitive 
service while maintaining a profitable business. I would like to see more focus on the quality of a company's 
services, rather than who may or may not have the biggest budget to offer incentives or run big advertising 
campaigns. Companies should be judged on how they treat their customers.
**Whose career do you most admire and why?**
I admire Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair. Through a high-risk strategy, he has changed the aviation 
industry in Ireland. He consistently breaks into new markets and has made the industry competitive, which benefits 
the consumer. Where other industry leaders have left, he has made Ireland his home and I believe he will continue 
to develop the aviation industry here, creating much needed employment.Based on your experience, what is the 
most valuable career advice you can offer others?
That you should work hard and take responsibility for your role.
No matter what level you work at, or what size the company you work for, management will notice if an employee is 
interested in helping to drive the business forward. Coming from a customer-led industry like ours, it is extremely 
valuable to have people who take ownership of their role and who have the business' interests at heart.
**What is your ultimate professional goal?**
My immediate goal is to continue managing our existing outlets in Ireland while making our new online Click & 
Collect service successful. Ultimately, the focus of my attention in 2014 will be to make ICE the leader in retail 
foreign exchange in Ireland.

Jolly good news for Barclays shareholders. Antony Jenkins, chief executive, says the bank will not be paying more 
to top executives than necessary.
This is in clear contrast to the last lot in charge there, whose approach at times seemed to be: here's the cheque - 
you fill in the amount.
Mr Jenkins could hardly refuse the BBC's offer to be a guest editor of Today , and the New Year's eve programme 
provided a perfect platform to explain why it's all going to be different under him.
After what he bizarrely described as a "30-year shift to short-termism" in banking, greed is definitely off the menu. 
Mind you, he's proposing to stay in those activities traditionally ruled by greed, and so will have to pay accordingly.
He would like the Barclays boys to think about the interests of their customers rather than merely about their own, 
and to prove that good banking is also profitable banking. This is such a challenge that even if he's serious, and can 
take the rest of the top echelon with him, he's likely to have gone long before it happens.
He reckons it could take a decade to change the culture, assuming that it really has started already.
Perhaps there is no latter-day equivalent of PPI mis-selling going on at present, or of viable small businesses being 
sent to the wall, or traders gaming the rules. Perhaps Mr Jenkins really has disbanded the department of tax fiddles, 
Barclays culture change is too big a challenge for Jenkins' term
as he claims, but as John Kay gloomily put it in the programme: "It's not archbishops who tell you they're honest, it's 
bankers." Of course, it's the editor's decision when to run such critical comments - like before 6.30am.
Bad luck if you bet on miners and gold last year. Clever you if you stocked up on airlines. If anyone got that double, 
they're keeping strangely quiet. A year ago gold was the low-risk insurance policy, while the airlines were at the 
mercy of dearer fuel, more taxes and cash-strapped consumers.
They still are, but the sea change (air change?) in the industry came with Michael O'Leary's admission that there 
was a limit to the humiliation that Ryanair passengers would endure for cheapish flights to somewhere quite near 
their destination. They would pay for something a bit better. Service is hard to get right , but lucrative for the carriers 
if they do.
Gold, meanwhile, proved again that trying to value it is a game for mugs and bugs. Even while the world's central 
banks are printing money like never before, the metal can endure an eye-watering bear market. While the gold 
miners can only hope that it doesn't keep going, the base metal miners are, at last, embarking on some self-help 
after the excesses of the boom.
The talk at all the big houses is of projects postponed, businesses sold or efficiency drives. This is a slow process, 
needing painful write-offs and repentance from previous excesses, but it generates prodigious amounts of cash. As 
that money starts to flow towards the shareholders, miners will be viewed as income stocks in a market where 
sustainable dividends become increasingly expensive.
A bear market in copper and steel would upset the ore-train, but continuing recovery in America and the start of one 
in the eurozone should sustain demand as it finally flags in China.
The US can hardly fail to grow, driven by cheap oil and dirt-cheap gas from fracking, an energy revolution whose 
consequences will be profound. The investing lesson from last year is that gold was not the insurance policy it 
seemed. This year's may be that mining useful things is quite attractive after all.
If you're struggling to understand why British productivity is so poor, then look around you and consider the past two 
weeks. With Christmas day falling on a Wednesday, the opportunity to faire le pont by bridging to le weekend 
becomes more like a pontoon, with working days broken into such short chunks that it's hardly worth the bother of 
coming in. Not so much a lost weekend, then, as a lost fortnight, or almost 4 per cent of the year.

Stock markets flew in much of the world last year so it's only fitting that the FTSE 100's biggest two gainers in 2013 
were airlines.
While the UK's blue chip index advanced 14.4% investors in International Airlines Group (ICAG.L) saw their shares 
soar more than 117%, while shareholders in Easyjet doubled their money, according to Thomson Reuters data.
IAG has reaped the reward of restructuring British Airways a few years ago and is getting the benefit of the doubt in 
its efforts to turn round Iberia, the loss-making Spanish airline with which BA merged in 2011. In November it 
impressed the City with a doubling in first half profits and raising its 2015 profit target to 1.8 billion (£1.5 billion) from 
1.6 billion (£1.3 billion).
This is good news for investors in the Templeton Growth fund, co-managed by the Citywire AAA-rated Peter 
Moeschter and Dylan Ball, and the highly regarded Majedie UK Equity fund, which both hold IAG as a top 10 
position.
Easyjet (EZJ.L) has also bucked the impact of weak economic growth and high fuel costs. Its switch to a more 
customer-friendly approach outfooted arch rival Ryanair (RYA.L) and boosted profits, enabling it to pay a £175 
million special dividend. Among investors to be pleased was Tom Dobell, manager of the M&G Recovery fund, 
which allocates 2.5% of its money to Easyjet. The fund needed a boost after indifferent performance in recent 
years.
Speaking of dividends, our two tables show the yield of the top risers and fallers, based on analysts' dividend 
forecasts for the year ahead. After last year's strong share price gains, it's no surprise that the top FTSE risers (see 
below) yield less than the 10 biggest fallers (see bottom of the article), most of which are in the battered mining and 
natural resources sectors.
As feared, the controversial mega-merger of Glencore and Xstrata signalled the peak of the commodities boom. 
The merged company (GLEN.L) marked its first year with an 11% share price fall, although that was relatively light 
compared to the carnage elsewhere in the sector, particularly in precious metals where silver miner Fresnillo 
(FRES.L) slumped nearly 60%.

House builder Persimmon (PSN.L) is an exception, yielding just over 5% despite a near two thirds leap in its share 
price in response to the government's housing market intervention last year. That's one reason why the body of 
analyst opinion remains in favour of the stock (Thomson Reuters records seven 'holds', four 'buys' and two 'strong 
buys' offset by just one 'sell' and 'strong sell' apiece).
To be fair, the collective opinion of City scribblers is broadly positive on all the stocks, whether they are at the top or 
the bottom of the FTSE 100. Many analysts are presumably betting on the big risers maintaining their momentum 
while reckoning those at the bottom of the pile may bounce back in 2014.
The one stock where there is an even split in analyst opinion is Hargreaves Lansdown (HRGV.L). Analysts are 
divided on whether the online stock broker and funds supermarket can maintain its progress after a year in which its 
share price doubled and its leadership of the growing market for DIY investors was confirmed. According to 
Thomson Reuters, six analysts rate the stock a 'hold' with three analysts recommending it either as a buy or sell. 
With the shares trading at 33 times forecast earnings, investors are clearly having to pay for the growth it offers.
Much may depend on customer reaction to the new tariffs and charges that Hargreaves - and its rivals - are 
expected to unveil shortly. Fund managers Harry Nimmo (pictured) and Nick Train are betting the company will pull 
through any turbulence and will benefit from the growing numbers of people switching to the Internet to take charge 
of their savings and investments. They respectively hold 3.5% and 7.6% of their Standard Life Investments UK 
Smaller Companies and Linsdell Train UK Equity funds in the stock.
Elsewhere, Travis Perkins (TPK.L), the country's biggest supplier of building materials, held by Nigel Thomas in the 
AXA Framlington UK Select Opportunities fund, has also benefited from the coalition efforts to stimulate the housing 
market.
Similarly, Ashtead (AHT.L), which hires diggers and building tools, has continued to enjoy the boom in US 
construction, much to the pleasure of manager Richard Watts who has it as a top holding in the Old Mutual UK Mid 
Cap fund.
Sports Direct International (SPD.L), the retailer controlled by Mike Ashley, the billionaire owner of Newcastle United, 
shows the reward of supplying consumers with affordable goods. Crispin Odey (pictured) has traded in SPD 
through his Allegra International, Opus and UK Absolute Return funds. However, the share price has dipped 3% in 
the past month after analysts detected a less than stellar trading performance in the half-year results last month.
Sentiment remains positive for ITV (ITV.L). Although it lost the Christmas ratings war with the BBC, investors have 
been impressed with the turnaround wrought by chief executive Adam Crozier and are looking forward to another 
special dividend if this year's World Cup brings in the advertisers to the broadcaster of Downton Abbey and the X-
Factor. According to Thomson Reuters, Clive Beagles, the Citywire AA-rated manager of JOHCM UK Equity 
Income took some profits in the stock last September.
Lastly, there has been a dramatic turnround in Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L). Although the shares are well below 
their pre-crisis levels, they have surged in response to the government's decision to start selling down its stake and 
signals from chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio that a return to the dividend list may not be far off. However, the 
13% slide in Standard Chartered (STAN.L) following the downturn in emerging markets shows that the sector needs 
careful handling. The same applies to RSA Insurance Group (RSA.L), victim of three profits warning last year.

Restructuring plan is emblematic of the challenges facing Europe's airlines, says Andrew Parker
Body
Iberia starts 2014 with its contentious cost-cutting plan approaching a critical stage.
The Spanish flag carrier - which combined with British Airways in 2011 to form International Airlines Group - is 
starting to improve its performance after axing thousands of jobs and cutting the salaries of those remaining.
But much now rests on the company's management reaching agreements with trade unions on improved workforce 
productivity that could enable Iberia - a leading provider of European flights to Latin America - to compete 
successfully with more nimble rivals.
The two sides were trying to reach agreement before the end of 2013, but this did not happen. Both are privately 
saying deals could be concluded soon after months of talks.
The complex restructuring of Iberia exemplifies the challenges of putting European airlines with unwieldy cost 
structures on a profitable footing. American carriers have used the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy process over the past 
decade to reduce operating expenses and debt loads, but there is no equivalent procedure in Europe, leaving the 
region's airlines to attempt more piecemeal cost-cutting.
Iberia revamp at critical stage on landing path TRAVEL & LEISURE
The need to restructure Iberia was laid bare in IAG's full-year results for 2012, when the group plunged to a pre-tax 
loss of EUR997m because of the Spanish airline's struggle to compete - whether with Ryanair on short-haul 
European flights or Latam Airline Group on long-distance routes to Latin America. It has also been hit hard by 
Spain's deep economic downturn.
But Iberia's second- and third-quarter results in 2013 were an improvement on 2012, leading Willie Walsh, IAG's 
chief executive, to say in November: "There's a lot of work that we need to do, but it is work in progress and it is 
heading in the right direction."
This sense of momentum has given investors increasing confidence in Iberia's turnround, and helped propel IAG's 
shares to record levels. The stock rose 117 per cent in 2013, making it the best performer in the FTSE 100 index.
Iberia's restructuring is far from complete, however. At its annual briefing with analysts in November, IAG signalled 
Iberia could make a reduced contribution to group operating profit in 2015 compared with previous expectations.
In 2012, IAG implied Iberia could generate up to EUR300m of operating profit in 2015, but Neil Glynn, analyst at 
Credit Suisse, estimates the airline will only generate EUR100m.
The principal reason for his EUR100m estimate is Iberia's management has been unable to proceed with its original 
plan to axe up to 4,500 jobs - or 23 per cent of the workforce.
This is because unions responded to the plan with strikes, and the Spanish government then intervened by 
appointing a mediator who proposed that only 3,100 jobs be cut - 16 per cent of the total.
IAG is hoping the lower cost savings at Iberia can be offset by a better revenue performance, but with the final job 
cuts being less than those initially sought, it has heightened the importance of the airline securing improved 
productivity deals with unions representing pilots, cabin crew and ground staff.
Some analysts say Sepla, the pilots union, is the main stumbling block to management finalising these 
arrangements, and one of the most sensitive areas during negotiations has been Iberia Express, the low-cost 
carrier set up in 2012 by Iberia because its own short-haul operations were uncompetitive.
Iberia Express has performed well, with management expecting a 5 per cent operating margin in 2013, but Sepla 
opposed its creation, and strikes took place in 2011 and last year.
Pilots at Iberia Express work longer hours than those at Iberia's mainline business. Iberia Express pilots are flying 
about 850 hours each year - compared with 650 at Iberia's short haul operations.
Justo Peral, head of Sepla's Iberia branch, says the union is willing to accept that Iberia pilots should fly up to 850 
hours a year - but it wants a commitment by management to grow the airline. The fleet's capacity was cut by 15 per 
cent last year to eliminate lossmaking routes.
In a further sign of potential compromise with the management, Mr Peral says Sepla may accept a limited 
expansion of Iberia Express - although he rejects the case for it expanding from its existing 14 aircraft to 40 
passenger jets.
Iberia's management was originally hoping to increase Iberia Express's fleet to 40, but Luis Gallego, chief 
executive, said in November that he did not have a "clear number", partly because the government appointed an 
arbitrator who ruled the carrier could not grow until after 2014.
Mr Gallego declined to be interviewed, but one IAG insider says there is optimism that productivity deals can be 
finalised with the unions, noting that Sepla was engaged in constructive talks with management.

The Reit way up
Not so long ago it was all about wreaths for the dying Irish property market. But now Reits, or real estate investment 
trusts, are helping to breathe new life into a stabilising patient.
When Green Reit debuted on the Iseq in July, it was clear from the outset that there was an appetite for a property 
owning, publicly quoted trust. It rose 9 per cent on day one of its IPO, one of Europe's biggest this year.
It raised Euro 310 million from investors, Euro 110 million more than its original target. By the end of October, it had 
spent Euro 178 million of that on Dublin property, including a portfolio of Danske Bank property.
The positivity, of course, has been helped by the presence of big US heavy weights including billionaire John 
Paulson, investment firm BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton, which now holds 13.55 per cent.
Last month, Green was joined on the Iseq by Hibernia Reit, which raised Euro 365 million in its IPO.

**Service with a smile**
While Ryanair may continue its expansion eastward to Russia or Israel, the most intriguing Irish corporate journey 
this year was its chief executive Michael O'Leary's Pauline conversion on the road to Damascus. The new, friendlier 
Ryanair has cut excess baggage fees, introduced allocated seating and grace periods for booking errors. O'Leary 
himself as even taken to Twitter to answer customer complaints.
Of course, there is nothing like a profit warning or two to instil some repentance in a chief executive, and that is 
exactly what Ryanair was forced to deliver in the autumn against the backdrop of a brutally competitive European 
short-haul market.
Markets: the hits and misses of 2013
But it wasn't all bad news. The lifting of the controversial travel tax by the government provoked an immediate 
reaction from the company, and it has promised to carry one million extra passengers through Irish airports per 
annum.

**The whey ahead**
The relative price of the different parts of an egg provide for an interesting illustration as to the ever increasing 
sophistication of the Irish food industry.
With menus becoming ever more health conscious, the price of protein rich egg white has rocketed 60 per cent 
recently, leading to an oversupply of fattier egg yolks and a volatile overall egg market. In steps Glanbia with its 
Optisol 3000 egg replacement system, which utilises whey protein and flaxseed and picked up an international 
innovation award for the company.
While the company's impressive 30 per cent share price rise this year is driven by strong sales growth, increasing 
internationalisation and the promise of huge opportunity in the dairy sector, such innovation is key to its success.
Confidence, too, is a potent ingredient for the increasing success and internationalisation of the Irish food sector.

**A lot done, more to do**
In many ways, it was a tremendous year for Bank of Ireland, particularly if, like the Irish state, you owned the stock. 
The bank shone a bright light down the path that leads away from state-owned bailout misery towards a brighter 
future. The government's sale of the bank's convertible capital notes, or CoCos, in January was an early sign of 
progress, for the bank and for Ireland.
Some analysts believe that the government should complete the job by following up its recent disposal of a EUR 1.8 
billion preference shareholding in the bank by cashing in its remaining 14.1 per cent stake sooner rather than later. 
If other banks in the beleaguered sector manage to stumble in the same direction the entire country will benefit.
Nevertheless, huge challenges await in 2014. Mario Draghi recently refused to give the Irish banking system his full 
vote of confidence and the European Central Bank stress tests due next year are the key hurdle. Moody's 
downgrad ed Bank of Ireland earlier this month saying that ''banks such as BoI with poor-quality lending books, 
relatively low levels of provisions and poor profitability, are at relatively greater risk of failing the test.''
A lot done, more to do, as a big fan of the shares once said.

**One-hit wonders?**
Markets: the hits and misses of 2013
Rock bands speak fearfully of the difficult second album - the one that decides whether they are one-hit wonders or 
destined for a life of rock'n'roll excess. Well, Barryroe was a big hit back in 2012 for exploration company 
Providence Resources. But 2013 was the year of the difficult Dunquin North/Porcupine basin follow-up concept.
When a much-heralded drilling exploration hit water rather than oil, the well was abandoned and the shares tanked. 
But all is not lost. Farming out Barryroe could be lucrative. Analysis of the Dunquin data suggests all is not lost and 
the company still has a portfolio of other licences around the Irish coast. Rock on, Providence.
**Providence Resources shares year-to-date, -67 per cent**
**Petroceltic shares year-to-date, -11 per cent**
**Lazarus bows out**
And so the rollercoaster shudders to a halt. Elan was always a breathtaking ride. Its story is now closing after 
Michigan-based healthcare firm Perrigo agreed to buy it for $8.6 billion. Royalty Pharma had battled unsuccessfully 
earlier in the year to acquire Elan against its will.
Such fevered interest was a remote possibility back in the dark days of 2002 when Elan had taken a $400 million 
writedown and its shares had plunged 96 per cent.
It was voted least favourite stock on the Iseq, while Anglo Irish Bank was the favourite. But Elan recovered to go on 
to ease the suffering of thousands of MS patients, make a stab at curing Alzheimer's and, following the closure of 
the Perrigo deal, deliver a Euro 1 6 million payout to seven company executives.
**Elan shares year-to-date, +62 per cent**
**United Drug (London listed) shares year-to-date, +16.9 per cent**
**All boxed off**
Packaging giant Smurfit Kappa may appear unremarkable. But during a deep recession, in an industry that tends to 
track economic growth, it has excelled.
Smurfit Kappa boss Gary McGann said earlier this year that his company can afford a EUR 300 million acquisition 
every year without adversely affecting its debt-to-equity metrics. It has already helped smooth European growth 
issues with its Euro 260 million purchase of Mexican firm Orange County last year, helping to prove that Irish 
companies can and do excel abroad.

With a population of just under a million it is hardly surprising that the South West region has started to emerge 
from the downturn - with a substantial increase in the number of new enterprises reported in and around Cork city in 
particular.
''In the last 22 months we've funded 82 enterprises to the tune of Euro 1.8 million, or an average of EUR 22,000 per 
business. The demand for advice, mentoring and training has soared,'' said Sean O'Sullivan of the South Cork 
Enterprise Board.
In itself, the South West is a sizeable market for local service providers and producers.
Add to that the increase in tourists visiting the region through its three international airports and port in Cork, and 
the potential gain for the right enterprise is obvious.
In 2012, more than two and a half million tourists from overseas visited the South West and Shannon regions, with 
an estimated revenue intake of almost EUR 800 million.
Not surprisingly, the counties of Cork and Kerry fared best, with the former attracting 1.2 million foreign visitors and 
Kerry 826,000.
The domestic tourist influx swells the population of the South West further, especially during the summer months, 
and tourism numbers for 2013 are set to eclipse those of last year.
In Kerry, the impact of the collapse of the construction industry can still be felt, but Tomas Hayes, chief executive 
officer of the County Enterprise Board (CEB) there, explains how a strong network of support in the county is 
helping people re-invent themselves.
''If you go back to 2008, something like 30 per cent of employment in the county was construction-related, from 
builders to interior designers, architects, engineers and so on,'' he said.
Start-ups nationwide: South West finds an appetite for innovation
''Kerry has always had a vibrant entrepreneurial community though, and many of those who lost their jobs in the 
construction sector bounced back, with start-ups in completely different fields.
''There's a huge appetite for innovation here, together with a recognition that we have to look to external markets to 
grow businesses.''
Grant aid of EUR 479,602 was approved by Kerry CEB for 40 micro enterprises in 2012, with the potential to create 
124 full time and 37 part-time or seasonal jobs. A further 38 projects were approved in 2013 to the end of October.
Since gaining independence from the Dublin Airport Authority, Shannon Airport has witnessed its first increase in 
traffic for three years - in the month of June alone the number of passengers using the airport jumped by 8 per cent 
from the same month in 2012.
As a successful 2013 drew to a close for the rejuvenated airport, Ryanair announced it was to initiate eight new 
routes from Shannon next April.
The boost sent ripples of optimism into the surrounding towns and villages of county Clare and, as Eamon Ryan of 
the Limerick City enterprise board explains, they are even reaching the Treaty city itself.
''Greater volumes of people mean greater purchasing power, so those businesses that supply our retail outlets 
inevitably have an increased market. The hotels are busier, so local food producers are passing on more stock. The 
positive impact of the airport's success on Limerick City and the Shannon region can't be understated,'' said Ryan.
Back in South Cork, Sean O'Sullivan told *The Sunday Business Post*that a change in approach by the large multi-
national supermarket chains is having a hugely positive impact for local food producers.
''When people think of Cork they think of food, and we have to make sure we build on that brand. The number of 
new artisan food producers serving local farmer's markets has increased dramatically.
''Of course, that's a major shop window, as the multiples realise the national palate has changed and people want 
more diversity and quality - and, crucially, they want to buy Irish,'' said O'Sullivan.
''The Tescos of this world are sending people out to country markets. The end of central buying is a major 
development in the indigenous food sector.''
Further north, Michael Hanley of the North Cork Enterprise Board has also noticed a much greater concentration on 
food production.
''Traditionally, the niche food stuffs would have been associated with just west Cork, but not any more. Even here, 
which traditionally would have been a manufacturing and processing area, the growth in food start-ups is 
remarkable.''
In the Cork Business Innovation Centre the concentration is on more high-tech and knowledge-intensive industries. 
A private-sector led organisation, it develops several high potential start-ups or expansions each year. It claims that 
85 per cent of the new enterprises it assists survive past the crucial five-year stage.
In the west of the region, Enterprise Ireland now oversees many of the duties formerly carried out by Shannon 
Development in Clare, Limerick and parts of Kerry, Offaly and Tipperary.
While counties such as Limerick suffered particularly badly during the economic collapse, the University of Limerick 
and Limerick Institute of Technology have played their part in re-establishing a culture of enterprise through their 
role in Enterprise Ireland's New Frontiers Programme. Social problems continue to exist, though - parts of Limerick 
still suffer from huge unemployment.
Start-ups nationwide: South West finds an appetite for innovation
Across the Shannon, in Clare, the scene is more encouraging. Ennis Innovate, a regional innovation centre, 
delivers a range of services to new enterprises, from training and mentoring to academic linkages, and is able to 
refer new start-ups to possible streams of funding.

2013: The year that brought us twerking and squinching

What a difference a year makes. Just 12 months ago, most of us didn't know what twerking was, while we all did 
our best to avoid squinching. In 2013, however, both words became popular search terms, particularly among 
internet users in Ireland.
Google's annual zeitgeist report, which highlights the most searched for people, places and things, has once again 
thrown up a fascinating snapshot of what is and isn't in fashion. What's most interesting about this year's edition is 
how many of the trending terms have been with us for a while.
Take twerking. The provocative dance has been around since at least the early 2000s, but recently hit the headlines 
when Miley Cyrus took it upon herself to indulge in a spot of it at an awards ceremony. Meanwhile, squinching is 
simply the act of squinting while posing for a photograph to look more beautiful and that's been around as long as 
the camera.
Another popular trending term this year is catfish, a phase used to describe an individual who pretends to be 
someone they're not by using social media to create false identities and pursue deceptive online romances. A 
documentary called Catfish was released back in 2007, and the word has since slipped into popular parlance.
In addition to providing a snapshot of what's trending globally, Google offers country-wide zeitgeists for over 70 
countries. Its reports for Ireland date back to 2008, when Bebo was the most searched for term and Lisbon Treaty-
related keywords were in vogue.
This year's zeitgeist - the German for the spirit of the times - mirrored that of other countries with television shows 
such as Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones featuring at the top of the lists. The personalities that Irish people 
wanted to know more about included Nigella Lawson, Oscar Pistorius, Amanda Bynes and Pope Francis.
Many of the top searches around personalities would be pretty similar from country to country. There are a lot of 
well-known individuals we lost in 2013, including the late Fast and Furious' star Paul Walker, Glee' actor Cory 
Monteith, former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and the Sopranos' lead James Gandolfini. People from 
2013: The year that brought us twerking and squinching
across the globe wanted to know more about them, as well as the likes of Nelson Mandela,'' said Fionnuala 
Meehan, online sales and operations manager at Google Ireland.
The top trending generic searches is where you see the differences between countries. In Ireland the issues that 
were top of people's minds involved travel, with the likes of Ryanair and Trivago among the top searches, and 
issues such as the property tax,'' said Meehan.
According to Meehan, each zeitgeist report throws up a few surprises and this year's edition is no different.
One of the main surprises for Ireland is that there continues to be a good mix of international and local, and old and 
new, in the searches people carry out. For example, in terms of personalities, One Direction and Miley Cyrus 
feature highly, but so do Bonnie Tyler and Cher. The likes of Love/Hate and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here 
have been popular, but so have traditional programmes such as The Rose of Tralee,'' said Meehan.
The zeitgeist report, first made available in 2001, captures a moment in time. It offers an invaluable insight into the 
current preoccupations of internet users around the world. As most leading search terms are related to news 
events, it's not easy to predict with any certainty what will crop up in the coming year.
Social media and the constant sharing of information mean that new words and phrases are coming up all the time 
and so it is impossible to know what is likely to be popular over the next 12 months,'' said Meehan.
Having said that, I think that with wearable gadgets such as Google Glass coming on-stream, we're going to see 
these items featuring prominently in search results in the near future,'' she said.
Anyone hoping that the zeitgeist offers some kind of crystal ball into what will remain popular in the coming years is 
set to be disappointed. For while it can be useful as a guide of what's up and coming, the zeitgeist often serves to 
show what is just a flash in the pan, particularly when it comes to popular websites.
Former high-scoring trends among Irish internet users over the past few years have included Chatroulette, a 
controversial website that pairs random people from around the world together for webcam-based conversations, 
and the aforementioned social networking site Bebo, both of which are now very much in the where are they now' 
category.

The 20 millionth passenger mark: record numbers for Dublin Airport
The 20 millionth passenger mark: record numbers for Dublin Airport

Dublin Airport will welcome its 20 millionth passenger of the year within the next 48 hours, after an extra one million 
passengers used the airport during 2013.
It is the first time in four years that the airport will break the 20 million mark. The spike came after airlines added 
significant extra capacity at Dublin Airport this year, particularly on transatlantic routes.
Transfer traffic also expanded rapidly. There was growth in passengers travelling to the Middle East and Europe, 
and the Gathering tourism initiative also boosted numbers.
Transatlantic traffic led the way, with a record 1.8 million passengers flying between Dublin and North American 
destinations in 2013.
This narrowly beat the previous all-time record of 1.79 million, set during the dying days of the Celtic Tiger era in 
2008.
The number of available seats on flights between Dublin and North America increased by more than 20 per cent 
during 2013. Demand for this additional capacity was strong, according to DAA chief executive Kevin Toland.
''We're up almost 6 per cent for the year, which is our third consecutive year of passenger growth at Dublin,'' Toland 
said.
''Dublin Airport has had 16 consecutive months of traffic growth, and has outperformed the European average in 
each of the past 14 months.
''Passenger growth is expected to continue into next year as we already have 15 new services confirmed for 2014, 
as our airline partners launch new routes to North America and Europe.''
The 20 millionth passenger mark: record numbers for Dublin Airport
Annual passenger numbers at Dublin Airport peaked at just under 23.5 million in 2008, and fell back to 18.4 million 
in 2010 before beginning to grow again.
New routes for 2014 include Aer Lingus services to San Francisco, Toronto, Hanover and Pula; Ryanair routes to 
Lisbon, Prague, Bucharest, Basel, Marrakech, Almeria, Bari, Chania and Comiso; Westjet services to St John's in 
Newfoundland; a Luxair route to Luxembourg; and an Air Canada Rouge service to Toronto.
Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Leo Varadkar greeted the growth at Dublin Airport as further evidence of 
the strong performance of the tourism sector over the past 12 months.

**Most Irish workers would consider emigration, new survey shows**
More than two-thirds of Irish workers would consider looking abroad to further their career, according to a new 
emigration survey by recruitment specialist Hays.
While the number of people emigrating from Ireland is believed to be falling, 67.4 per cent of people surveyed by 
Hays said they would consider leaving Ireland if their career prospects showed little improvement over the next 
three years.
Hays found that there had been an increase in optimism about Ireland's prospects, with 47 per cent of people 
confident that employment prospects would improve here over the next three years.
Around 10 per cent of people responded that they were very confident, while 42 per cent of people replied that they 
were not confident.
The survey found that, of those who had already moved abroad, up to two-thirds would move back to Ireland if job 
prospects improved in their sector.

A staff retraining scheme has left low-cost rivals scrambling to catch up, says Jane Wild 
Body
At easyJet's training academy, a room of cabin crew are watching comedian Dawn French hurtle, screaming, 
towards a lake before launching herself in.
The video cuts to a drawing room of a stately home where a hushed circle of suspects is sternly informed by a 
detective of the crime - murder - but the weapon? Behaviour and poor treatment at the hands of sales assistants, 
which proved fatal.
EasyJet staff have gone back into the training room to be instructed on their ABC - attitude, behaviour and 
communication - and are being shown how unwitting actions make an impression on customers. There are 
disapproving tuts as they watch cabin crew actors on screen stow up trays with a sigh or a pouting stewardess 
flouncing towards a departure gate.
Customer service has become easyJet's own weapon, wielded against rivals in the highly competitive airline market 
. Under Carolyn McCall, chief executive, raising the customer satisfaction bar has been placed at the heart of what 
easyJet does, in its aim to seize more market share and reach its goal of becoming Europe's preferred short-haul 
airline.
EasyJet blazes a trail on overhauling customer service TRAVEL & LEISURE
The low-cost airline is pushing ahead with a programme to transform company culture and the results have been 
evident: its full year pre-tax profit increased 51 per cent to £478m and it will pay out a £175m dividend.
Furthermore, after two recent profit warnings Ryanair has acknowledged the success of its rival's efforts and done 
an abrupt U-turn, with chief executive Michael O'Leary admitting it needed to stop "unnecessarily pissing people 
off".
"As a low-cost airline it's where we can differentiate ourselves," Angie Mullen, easyJet's cabin crew service and 
standards manager says of its drive.
As she walks through the academy she points out staff who have won awards and talks about the inter-airline 
competitions coming up. "No pressure," she says as she paces down the corridor, "no pressure".
Ms McCall has underscored the difference between it and the "stuffy" and more formal competition. "If you go on 
our planes, our crew will have a laugh with you," she says. "If it's appropriate, they'll have a joke - they're very easy 
."
Getting that judgment right is down to experience, says crew member Jonathan Roberts. His colleague, Leslie 
Gamble adds: "With businessmen often you get them a coffee, say 'anything else sir', get a 'no thanks' and you 
move on. But you get other passengers that want to share their life story."
Meanwhile, the list of initiatives to raise standards and burnish the "orange spirit" is lengthy and growing. Out has 
gone the old uniform with the garish orange men's shirt, in instead are touches of orange and a "fun" striped tie. A 
magazine-style book of style tips dispenses advice such as "the tousled look has no place onboard" and instructing 
ladies to keep underwear to white or nude shades only.
There is a customer charter, made of promises from staff. There are scores of "customer champions", employees 
with a brief to inform and inspire colleagues.
There is a pledge day, numerous internal awards and a Spirit Awards Portal, where staff log on to commend 
colleagues.
There are feel-good videos and, next, behaviour pins, to be won by crew for displaying certain behaviours towards 
passengers.
"We've been working really hard for two years on this cultural transformation around the customer," says Lisa 
Burger, head of customer experience. Customer satisfaction is up, and the test now will be keeping the momentum 
to stay ahead.
"We're full of ideas," says Peter Duffy, marketing and customer director. "We have a raft of stuff coming, some 
small, some big, which is going to make us better and better."
He is particularly proud of the work that has gone into repositioning the brand, into the website and app as well as 
on innovations such as allocated seating.
Rivals will not be able to catch up, he insists, because "we've been hiring against the criteria of great service for 
years and that is very, very difficult to replicate".
But Ryanair dismisses that argument. "I don't buy that," says Caroline Green, head of customer service. "We've 
always had good service on board. Some of the policies being softened make it easier for excellent service to show 
through. They [easyJet] will have their work cut out because we're going to be up and on a par with them very, very 
quickly."
It has followed in simplifying its website, is to introduce allocated seating in February and said last month it would 
take only three to six months to catch easyJet up.

Analysts point to the time needed to effect change. "You can't put a time on how long it takes to strengthen your 
brand name, for the perception of the airline to improve among the general public," says Gert Zonneveld, analyst at 
Panmure Gordon.
With many of easyJet's 30,000 staff being well educated and not direct employees, such as at airports, Ms Burger 
admits that other airlines may reap the advantages of their efforts.
But she says: "The industry is now challenging the industry to get better; that is only a benefit for everybody."

The ISEQ was trading flat this morning after a three-day rally as Ireland received some good news from S and P but 
after the ratings agency downgraded the EU.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was up 1.49 points to 4,464.66.
Global ratings agency, Standard and Poor's, this morning reaffirmed Ireland's debt rating and kept its "positive" 
outlook, adding that there is a one in three chance it could raise its rating in the next 18 months. It said it believes 
Ireland will continue to reduce its general government debt burden through budgetary consolidation and asset 
sales, as the domestic economy improves, allowing it to exit the EU/IMF program and maintain access to capital 
markets.
However, S and P cut its long-term rating of the European Union by one notch to AA+ today, saying it had concerns 
about how the bloc's budget was financed, a view EU leaders and other officials dismissed as misguided. "In our 
opinion, the overall creditworthiness of the now 28 European Union member states has declined," S and P said in a 
statement that came 11 months after it announced it had a 'negative' outlook on the bloc. "EU budgetary 
negotiations have become more contentious, signaling what we consider to be rising risks to the support of the EU 
from some member states." European officials said they were not surprised by the move since S and P recently 
downgraded the Netherlands and has lowered its view on six other member states - France, Italy, Spain, Malta, 
Slovenia and Cyprus - in the past year. Shares in Ryanair rose 8c to E6.24 while Aer Lingus stocks climbed 2c to 
E1.28. The number of overseas trips to Ireland by non-residents increased from 2.1 million in Quarter 3 2012 to 
2.26 million trips in Quarter 3 2013, latest figures from the CSO show. The number of nights spent in Ireland by 
overseas travellers increased by 8.7pc in Quarter 3 2013 compared with the same period of the previous year, up 
from 17.0 million to 18.5 million.

The ISEQ was trading flat this morning after a three-day rally as Ireland received some good news from S and P but 
after the ratings agency downgraded the EU.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was up 1.49 points to 4,464.66.
Global ratings agency, Standard and Poor's, this morning reaffirmed Ireland's debt rating and kept its "positive" 
outlook, adding that there is a one in three chance it could raise its rating in the next 18 months. It said it believes 
Ireland will continue to reduce its general government debt burden through budgetary consolidation and asset 
sales, as the domestic economy improves, allowing it to exit the EU/IMF program and maintain access to capital 
markets.
However, S and P cut its long-term rating of the European Union by one notch to AA+ today, saying it had concerns 
about how the bloc's budget was financed, a view EU leaders and other officials dismissed as misguided. "In our 
opinion, the overall creditworthiness of the now 28 European Union member states has declined," S and P said in a 
statement that came 11 months after it announced it had a 'negative' outlook on the bloc. "EU budgetary 
negotiations have become more contentious, signaling what we consider to be rising risks to the support of the EU 
from some member states." European officials said they were not surprised by the move since S and P recently 
downgraded the Netherlands and has lowered its view on six other member states - France, Italy, Spain, Malta, 
Slovenia and Cyprus - in the past year. Shares in Ryanair rose 8c to E6.24 while Aer Lingus stocks climbed 2c to 
E1.28. The number of overseas trips to Ireland by non-residents increased from 2.1 million in Quarter 3 2012 to 
2.26 million trips in Quarter 3 2013, latest figures from the CSO show. The number of nights spent in Ireland by 
overseas travellers increased by 8.7pc in Quarter 3 2013 compared with the same period of the previous year, up 
from 17.0 million to 18.5 million.

 The Malaysian-based airline AirAsia X is expected to start running cheap, long-haul flights from south-east Asia to 
Europe after purchasing 25 long range A330-300 aircraft from EADS (BMAD:EAD) operated Airbus for $6 billion.
 The deal represents the largest single order for the wide body twin engine aircraft that Airbus has ever received. It 
will start delivering to AirAsia in 2015, adding to the airline's current order of 26 A330-300 and 16 that already 
operate on routes from Kuala Lampur to asian and the middle-eastern destinations. 
 The airline's director, Tony Fernandes, also said on Wednesday that the order is a statement of intent in Air Asia's 
'next phase of development to be the undisputed global market leader.'
 The order is for newest version of the Airbus A330-300 which is capable of flying from Asia to the Americas or 
Europe non-stop. However, there has been no indication of how much the tickets will be, but whatever the cost 
passengers will be expected to pay extra for food, comfort kits and entertainment, as is the norm with other 
economy airlines.
 The order is the latest round in a flurry of business between AirAsia and Airbus over the last few years, including 
an order for 200 A320 Neo planes worth $16.24 billion, one of the biggest orders of commercial aircraft at that time. 
In separate deals they have also ordered 10 long-range Airbus A350-XWB.
 Other budget airlines recently have attempted to enter the long-haul market. Air Norwegian (OSLO:NAS) will start 
three-times-aweek service in July that will see flights going from London's Gatwick to New York, Los Angeles and 
Fort Lauderdale, Florida with fares starting at around $200 one-way.
 Ryanair (LON:RYA) has also expressed an interest in the market, claiming they will offer flights as little as $15-$20 
from Europe to the U.S., not including baggage fees and extra charges.

STANSTED executives were stoic yesterday after the airport was left off the shortlist for a new runway.
The airport, which was taken over by Manchester Airports Group in February, had set out plans to build a second 
runway - and Boris Johnson had talked up the site's prospects as a five-runway hub.
However, Sir Howard Davies said that Gatwick was a better option for expansion, as it nears the end of a council-
imposed ban on new construction before 2019.
Davies said Stansted would cost too much to transform into a megahub, meaning airline fees would double, and the 
airport has less need to expand as it is currently using just 53 per cent of its landing slots.
"As the report points out, there's still plenty of capacity to use up," said Tim Hawkins, corporate affairs director at 
MAG. "Improving the rail links will be key for us next year… and our focus is that by 2030 we will be making the 
best of the capacity we've got."
Chief exec Charlie Cornish said Stansted would reconsider its plan for an extra runway "at the right time".
Ryanair, which is Stansted's biggest airline, said it was disappointed by the news and called for "the deadhand of 
political interference" to be removed from decisions on runways.
The budget carrier plans to increase its traffic at Stansted by 50 per cent to more than 20m by 2023.
Luton, which is 49 per cent full, was also denied a place on the list for a new runway. But London's smaller airports 
are in line to get better road and rail links, after the chancellor pledged to upgrade surface access in his Autumn 
Statement this month.

In the year of another austerity Budget, more taxes, political scandals, the exit of the Troika and the continuing deep 
malaise in the banks, Irish people most wanted to know 'What is 'twerking'?'
That's according to Google's Zeitgeist results for 2013 today which also found that Paul Walker topped both 
Ireland's top searches and people list for 2013 while Irish mixed martial artist Conor McGregor was the top sports 
personality of the year.
Phil Hogan was the top trending Irish politician and Miley Cyrus the top trending artist, the annual Zeitgeist, which 
takes a look at the top trending and most popular search terms among Irish users on the Internet, found.
This year's results show that the Irish were either searching online for the latest updates on big events or trying to 
be responsible citizens. With the deadline given for homeowners to indicate how they wished to pay in 2014, 
'Property tax' was a popular search term on Google, as homeowners searched for more information. Travel and big 
events also interested the Irish with 'Ryanair', 'Trivago', 'Royal Baby', 'Oxegen' and 'Eurovision 2013' all making it 
into the top ten most popular search terms of 2013. The death of 'Fast and Furious' star Paul Walker, 'Glee' star 
Cory Monteith and more recently, the former president of Africa, Nelson Mandela all dominate the top trending 
searches for Ireland. New words in the Irish lexicon that weren't around in our father's day include: catfish - 
someone who pretends to be someone they're not, using social media to create false identities, particularly to 
pursue deceptive online romances. Twerking, as demonstrated by Miley Cyrus at the VMA awards, this search term 
also topped the What is..? list. Grumpy cat, it's a cat that - you've guessed it - looks grumpy. Squinch, a technique 
employed by models where you make a squeeze and pinch movement with your eyes - apparently it makes one 
look more attractive. Dr Who fans, or 'Whovians' make the list as the Sci-fi TV programme celebrated its 50th 
anniversary this year.

A new report on entrepreneurship is casting doubt on Ireland's reputation as a leading hotbed for innovative start-up 
activity. The report, by DCU Ryan Academy for Entrepreneurs, compares entrepreneurial rates and supports in 
Ireland with those of Netherlands, to determine how progressive our start-up scene really is.
Entrepreneur Watch: Ireland or the Netherlands, Which Country is More Entrepreneurial? illustrates the extent to 
which the Netherlands has overtake n Ireland in terms of business start-ups in the past decade, according to the 
academy.
The key findings of the report, co-authored by Professor Colm O'Gorman and Vanessa Diaz of DCU Business 
School, were as follows:
In 2005, Ireland was ranked first of the EU-15 countries in terms of the rate of entrepreneurship, with the Dutch 
ranked ninth. By 2012, the situation had reversed with the Netherlands ranked first and Ireland dropping to ninth 
place.
The rate of new business start-ups in 2012 was 2.5 times higher in the Netherlands than in Ireland.
While Ireland ranks higher than the Netherlands in terms of ease of doing business and the ease of starting a new 
business, the Dutch policy of reducing rules and regulations, reducing direct interventions targeted at business and 
diverting savings towards lowering taxes on business, have created an environment that is more business-friendly 
and encouraging of start-ups.
Significantly more people in the Netherlands perceive entrepreneurship to be a desirable career choice, while more 
Irish entrepreneurs report that their motivation was that there was no better alternative''.
On a more positive note, more Irish entrepreneurs are in medium- or high-tech sectors and are more ambitious in 
terms of expectations of growing their business or developing into international markets.
Talking Point: Why the Dutch lead the way
O'Gorman said that, while Ireland still ranked high as a good place to do business, the report indicated that the 
recent economic crises had a significant impact on the number of start-ups here.
Ireland continues to face a significant industrial development policy - how to create a context that supports business 
start-ups and growth?'' he said.
While some commentators have suggested that Ireland tops European league tables when it comes to attracting 
funding in the high-tech start-up sector, Ann Horan, chief executive of DCU Ryan Academy, said Entrepreneur 
Watch revealed a bleaker picture'' for the country's overall start-up activity in recent years.
Learning from the Dutch model, there is clearly a job of work to be done in terms of changing perceptions of 
entrepreneurship as a least-worst option, and creating a more supportive regulatory environment for start-ups,'' said 
Horan.

Home Secretary criticised for red tape Theresa May has been accused by cabinet colleagues of undermining the 
government's pro-business agenda by refusing to cut red tape in the Home Office. The Home Secretary was sent a 
"scathing letter" late last month by Michael Fallon, the Conservative business minister, and Vince Cable, the Liberal 
Democrat business secretary. They warned her department's poor record on cutting red tape was imperilling the 
coalition's goal of reducing the overall burden of regulation by 2015. The letter was dispatched after a meeting 
between Home Office officials and Cable at a cabinet subcommittee to track the progress of deregulation across 
government.
Carlyle picks Madrid for Applus float Carlyle has chosen Madrid over London for the multibillion-euro stock market

Shale gas boom helps US exports The US chemicals industry is planning a sharp increase in its exports as a result 
of the cost advantage created by the shale gas boom, putting pressure on competitors in Europe and Asia. The 
American Chemistry Council, the industry association, predicts in forecasts published this week that US chemicals 
exports will rise 45 per cent over the next five years, as a result of a wave of investment in new capacity.
Ryanair bows to passengers on bags Passengers habitually stung by Ryanair's hefty fees for overweight bags were

customer service. Ryanair has cut its excess baggage fees from (EURO)20 per kg to (EURO)10 per kg.
Goodnight campers: end of the road The Volkswagen camper van, officially known as the Kombi, has come to the

WHAT THE OTHER PAPERS SAY THIS MORNING
Central banks lose $400bn in gold rout Central banks, fearful of repeating Gordon Brown's mistake of selling the 
nation's gold reserves at the bottom of the market, have been caught out by the slide in prices this year, with the 
value of the precious metal held in their vaults falling by $400bn (£244bn), according to the latest broker research.
BlackRock says rally near exhaustion BlackRock, the world's biggest investor, has warned that central banks are 
poised to tighten monetary policy in the Anglo-Saxon countries and China, advising clients to pull out of global stock 
markets at any sign of serious trouble.

More flights were cancelled at London's Heathrow airport yesterday following the failure of one of the UK's air traffic 
control computer systems at the weekend.
Hundreds of flights were cancelled or delayed at many UK airports on Saturday after a computer server enabling air 
traffic controllers to communicate with one another failed.
The problem at National Air Traffic Services' Swanwick centre in Hampshire lasted about 12 hours on Saturday, 
and affected airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Birmingham, Cardiff and Glasgow.
At Heathrow, 228 flights were cancelled or about 18 per cent of the daily total. A further 18 flights were cancelled on 
Sunday, mainly because aircraft and crews were not available because of Saturday's disruption.
British Airways, the biggest airline at Heathrow, said it was too early to say whether it would seek compensation 
from Nats.
Ryanair complained that the air traffic control problem caused "chaos" for thousands of passengers, and urged the 
Civil Aviation Authority to intervene.
The CAA said airlines might win reductions in the payments they made to Nats for using its services if air traffic 
control were found to have missed certain performance targets.
More flights hit following air traffic control glitch Travel chaos
It added that passengers would not be able to obtain compensation from airlines, because the air traffic control 
problem was beyond their control, although it stressed carriers should be looking after travellers whose flights were 
delayed.
Nats apologised for the computer failure, but stressed that contingency measures on Saturday meant that it had 
been able to support 90 per cent of the flights that it normally would.

Ryanair has halved its excess baggage fee in its latest attempt to show a more customer-friendly face.
The budget airline said it was delivering an "early Christmas present" for customers by cutting its excess baggage 
fee to E10 a kilo from E20 from today.
The move follows the admission from Ryanair's outspoken chief executive, Michael O'Leary, that the company 
needed to change its culture after shareholders said the airline's "macho" image was harming business.
He conceded it should take a softer approach and stop "unnecessarily pissing people off". New business and family 
products are also being developed, along with a new mobile app, tailored country-specific websites and a mobile-
responsive website. Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: "Christmas is traditionally a time when people travel with lots of 
baggage. As an early Christmas present to our customers, Ryanair is cutting excess baggage fees by 50pc (from 
E20 to E10 per kg) from Mon (9 Dec). We want to say a very sincere thank you to our 81m passengers and wish 
them all a very happy Christmas."

The ISEQ is higher this morning at 4,371, up 22 points following some heavy selling in recent days. US payroll

Cantor Fitzgerald looks at Aer Lingus and it's pension issues:
Aer Lingus (N/C) have provided an update in relation to its pensions negotiations this morning.
Management have noted that it cannot accede to SIPTU's demands, which it believes contravene the proposals 
contained in the Labour Court Recommendations of the 24th of May 2013. According to the statement, SIPTU is 
advocating industrial action to its members without seeking further dialogue with Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus is now 
considering what further steps it should take in relation to SIPTU's communication of 5 December 2013. Comment: 
The prospect of industrial action, is likely to weigh negatively on the share price this morning. This comes in spite of 
Aer Lingus remaining committed to the implementation of the Labour Court recommendation, including the once-off 
contribution of E140m. Aer Lingus trades on a forward P/E of 10.5x vs the sector on 18.3x. Within the airline space, 
we continue to retain a preference for Ryanair (BUY - TP E7.00) and Lufthansa (BUY - TP E19.00) according to

Ryanair to allocate six aircraft to new Rome Fiumicino base
Ryanair to allocate six aircraft to new Rome Fiumicino base

Highlight: Ryanair, Ltd., an airline operator, has announced that it will allocate six aircraft to a new base in Rome 
Fiumicino Airport, and launch three new Southern Italy domestic routes with multiple daily flights to Catania and 
Palermo and Lamezia with these daily flights commencing on December 18, 2013.
Body
Ryanair also confirmed the 6 aircraft allocated to this new Rome Fiumicino base will also offer daily business flights 
to Brussels (Zaventem) and Barcelona (El Prat). These 3 new domestic routes from Rome Fiumicino will bring to 9 
the no. of domestic routes served by Ryanair from Rome, (as Alghero, Bari, Brindisi, Cagliari, Comiso and Trapani 
are already served from Rome Ciampino). Ryanair confirmed that over the next 12 months, it will move many of 
these Italian domestic routes from Ciampino to Fiumicino which will be its main airport for domestic services to/from 
Rome. This will free up slots at Rome Ciampino thereby enabling Ryanair to add more international flights and more 
new routes to its schedule at Rome Ciampino, the preferred Rome airport for travellers to/from international 
destinations. Starting in just under four weeks time, Ryanair's daily services from Rome Fiumicino to Catania (5 
times daily), Palermo (4 times daily) and Lamezia (2 times daily) will start at fares from just E49 one way (incl. 
all taxes and charges) which will be more than one third cheaper than Alitalia's lowest fares on these domestic 
routes which currently start at E75 one way. Ryanair also confirmed that it will increase these daily frequencies if 
Alitalia cuts back. Ryanair has also offered to use its low fare flights to feed into Alitalia's international network 
to/from Rome Fiumicino. Ryanair has for example offered to carry Alitalia passengers at one-way fares from just 
E50 which will enable Alitalia to significantly reduce the costs of its feed traffic on these domestic routes to Rome 
Fiumicino. Ryanair has also requested a meeting with Alitalia to examine any other opportunities which may exist 
for co-operating with and assisting Alitalia in its current restructuring. Speaking in Rome, Ryanair's Michael Cawley 
said: "We are pleased to increase our domestic operation from 6 to 9 routes from Rome, with high frequency daily 
services from Rome Fiumicino to Catania, Lamezia and Palermo. We are also pleased to open a 6 allocated aircraft 
base in Rome Fiumicino from December 18th to establish what will grow to be a large domestic base, which will 
create opportunities for Ryanair to significantly expand its international routes and frequencies at our principal 
Rome (Ciampino) airport. This Fiumicino base will increase from 6 to 10 or 12 allocated aircraft from October 2014, 
when Ryanair takes delivery of its next new aircraft orders from Boeing. "Since Ryanair is Italy's No. 1 airline, it is 
Ryanair to allocate six aircraft to new Rome Fiumicino base
important that we respond to our airport partners, who are looking to ensure that they have secure domestic routes 
and feed to/from Rome Fiumicino, particularly as Alitalia continues to restructure. Ryanair will guarantee that 
connectivity to Rome and to Southern Italy will be maintained regardless of Alitalia's plans to reduce capacity on 
domestic routes. "We hope Alitalia will take up our offer to co-operate with them, as we believe Ryanair's new low 
fare domestic flights to Fiumicino can significantly assist Alitalia through the restructuring which is necessary to 
restore its profitability and secure the future of as many of Alitalia's employees as possible. Ryanair believes that by 
offering to feed Alitalia's international hub at Fiumicino and by searching for opportunities to work with and assist 
Alitalia in its turnaround, that we can help the new investors and the management of Alitalia to return that airline to 
profitability and viability. "Ryanair's three new domestic routes from Rome Fiumicino to Catania, Lamezia and 
Palermo go on sale today at fares that start from just E49 one way and these low fares will enable many thousands 
of Italian families to return home to the South of Italy or Sicily in time for the Christmas celebrations."

As recently as five years ago, it seemed the battle for supremacy in Europe's skies was evolving into a contest 
between two sharply contrasting business models. Stately former national flag carriers - such as Air France-KLM, 
Lufthansa and International Airlines Group, which combines British Airways and Spain's Iberia - looked set to

Not any more. The differences between these two categories are becoming blurred. Former flag carriers now 
operate subsidiaries, such as Lufthansa's Germanwings and IAG's Spain-based Vueling, that provide competition 
on short-haul European flights. For their part, the low-cost airlines that have shuttled people around Europe since 
the 1990s are discarding their "no frills" image and upgrading services for passengers.
What is more, new entrant Norwegian Air Shuttle does not fit neatly into any category. It is low-cost, but it is setting 
its sights on transcontinental markets as well as the short-haul business. Its revolutionary objective is to connect 
European cities not only with each other but with US and Asian cities , at prices affordable for millions of travellers.
Norwegian might have been wiser to focus on conquering its Scandinavian market first. But it laid down an 
ambitious marker in January 2012 by arranging to buy 222 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing - a deal that it describes 
as Europe's largest single aircraft order.
If Norwegian proves as successful as easyJet and Ryanair were 20 years ago, there is no saying what Europe's 
airline industry may look like five years from now.
Lines blur between budget airlines and flag carriers
Nonetheless, Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, is surely right to predict that some airlines will not be dynamic 
enough to survive the new competitive pressures.
It is often easier said than done to close down or merge a European airline, but consolidation is much overdue in a 
sector crammed with more than 200 carriers.
Christoph Mueller, chief executive of Aer Lingus, the Irish carrier, is no less accurate in asserting that the extreme 
low-cost model, epitomised by Ryanair, has had its day.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, all but conceded this point in September when he said his airline would 
- miracle of miracles - set up a team to respond to customers' emails and would stop its deeply unpopular practice 
of fining passengers whose hand baggage is inches over the limit.
Amid Ryanair's profit warnings and falling share price of recent months, it has become fashionable in some quarters 
to sneer at the combative Mr O'Leary for supposedly getting his comeuppance.
But his airline is seeking to reform its culture from a position of strength: it carried almost 81m passengers in the 12 
months to October, at a load factor - a measure of seat occupancy - of 82 per cent. Far more people fly around 
Europe on Ryanair than on any of its competitors.
However, Ryanair has been slower than easyJet to adapt to changing conditions.
The two airlines devised their low-cost model 20 years later than Southwest Airlines, the US pioneer, but early 
enough to exploit the complacency of many unreconstructed European flag carriers.
Old-style airlines defended their higher prices on short-haul flights by arguing that passengers received a full range 
of services and the convenience of travel between Europe's main airports.
By contrast, budget carriers offered flights that were, as easyJet boasted at its birth in 1995, "as cheap as a pair of 
jeans". To keep down landing fees and other costs, they tended to fly between small, unglamorous airports located 
far from big cities. But easyJet always had one eye on building up a portfolio of slots at major airports. In recent 
times it has stolen a march on Ryanair by appreciating the need to attract more business passengers . One way to 
pull them in is to operate more flights in and out of big airports, close to business centres, such as Geneva, London 
Gatwick, Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Rome Fiumicino. EasyJet is now present at 14 of Europe's main 20 airports.
EasyJet was also quicker off the mark to offer allocated seats, modestly tastier refreshments, flexible fares, mobile 
phone boarding passes and other services.
Ryanair is following suit, but its brash image is so indelibly associated with leisure travel at rock-bottom prices that it 
may take time for the airline to win the extra business custom it wants.
That said, Ryanair, like easyJet, is no longer an upstart but a vastly experienced airline. Both have the cost 
discipline and innovative skills to contain the rising challenge from their newer rivals.

As recently as five years ago, it seemed the battle for supremacy in Europe's skies was evolving into a contest 
between two sharply contrasting business models. Stately former national flag carriers - such as Air France-KLM, 
Lufthansa and International Airlines Group, which combines British Airways and Spain's Iberia - looked set to 
dominate, while upstart low-cost airlines, such as easyJet and Ryanair, fought for budget passengers.

Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet, is set to take home a pay packet of £6.4m, up 74 per cent on last year, 
after a year in which the low-cost airline made record profits.
On top of her basic salary of £665,000 for 2013, she is in line for a bonus of £1.2m and £4.6m under a long-term 
incentive plan. Chris Kennedy, chief financial officer, will receive £3.7m, including a bonus of £533,000 and £2.7m 
under the incentive plan, more than double that of last year.
Chairman John Barton will receive £1.25m and Sir Michael Rake, former chairman who stepped down this year, 
£1.75m. All pay is subject to shareholder approval at the AGM in February.
EasyJet's profit has soared 51 per cent to £478m, the airline announced as it posted its full-year results last month 
and recommended a special dividend to shareholders of £175m. The airline entered the FTSE 100 in March and its 
share price has more than doubled this year. It rose 2 per cent to 1,409p yesterday.
Ms McCall 's pay package outstrips that of other airline chiefs. Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, took 
home EUR1.2m last year, while the pay of Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, fell 17 per 
cent to £1.1m, as the airline made heavy losses.
The pay of easyJet's management is recommended by its remuneration committee, which comprises four of its 
non-executive directors: Charles Gurassa, David Bennett, Rigas Doganis and Andy Martin.

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, whose family is the largest shareholder in easyJet, questioned the size of Ms McCall's 
package.
"Although the share price has gone up roughly three times since this management took over, their take home pay 
has multiplied in the order of 20-30 times," he said.
"A nice job if you can get the other directors to vote for it. Yet another case of City insiders enriching themselves 
without taking any risk. We shall see what other shareholders have to say at the AGM."
EasyJet said in a statement that its policy was to link pay to the company's performance with a basic salary plus a 
performance driven award and that 2013 had been a record year.

Byline: Sylvia Pfeifer
Highlight: Stephen Fitzpatrick tells Sylvia Pfeifer how his tiny energy supplier is turning up the heat on dominant 
incumbents
Body
Stephen Fitzpatrick's first job was a short stint trading derivatives pegged to Libor, the in-ter-bank lending rate, in 
the City of London in 2003. As a junior, he laughs, he was "not able to move any global benchmarks", referring to 
the scandal that has engulfed the market since.
A decade later Mr Fitzpatrick finds himself again on the fringe of what many believe is another scandal: the UK's 
relentlessly rising household energy bills . This time he is an up-start challenger to those under scrutiny.
The 36-year-old is founder and managing director of Ovo Energy, a tiny independent energy supplier trying to prise 
some business away from the "big six" providers, who control more than 95 per cent of the UK's household energy 
supply. With a turnover of £200m, it may make a small profit this year. It has 150,000 customers and about 300 
employees compared with the millions of customers and tens of thousands of staff of the big six.
Few had heard of Ovo before Mr Fitzpatrick's recent televised lambasting of the bosses of his bigger rivals, as they 
all appeared before a group of parliamentarians . He covered everything from bad customer service to stalling 
tactics against reform. "These guys are among the best filibusters in the business," he told the lawmakers.
Speaking in a London restaurant, wearing entrepreneur-regulation denim and fresh-faced despite broken nights 
following the recent arrival of his second child, he says the publicity is "much better than being ignored", but insists 
Power to the people
he is a "reluctant frontman". However, he says, "it's natural that people are looking for a real person to hear the 
message from".
The chutzpah shown at the energy select committee hearing brought comparisons with Michael O'Leary, the feisty 
chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair. Mr Fitzpatrick dislikes the comparison: "He is famous for saying after all 
these years of needlessly pissing off their customers they are going to have to change it," referring to an about-turn 
by Ryanair on customer service. Ovo's model, he says, is not about running a business at the lowest possible cost 
but about offering customers "the best possible value for money".
His attendance at the hearing was a good opportunity to raise Ovo's profile, he says. But more important than that, 
British consumers need someone in their corner, especially with Ofgem, the industry regulator, "not doing a 
particularly good job". The watchdog should take "a more proactive look at where the customer can benefit", he 
says, chutzpah on display again.
Critics - in private - accuse Mr Fitzpatrick of turning his appearance in front of MPs into an advert. But his plans to 
create an upstart challenger in energy supply and take on the poor service in the sector were not conceived 
overnight. While working in the City, he had looked for a market with high barriers to entry, "a big in-dust-ry" that 
had few new entrants despite deregulation.
He had always wanted to start his own company. After a degree in business and finance at Edinburgh university, he 
set up a property website and a free-sheet advertising property rentals before Lloyds TSB took him on to trade 
Libor. After six months he moved to Société Générale, then to JPMorgan as a bond trader.
Despite starting to make a decent living he decided to leave. His wife, whom he has known since he was 16, 
wanted to live in the countryside. "I thought, if I can stick to banking for five years, earn some money, then I could 
start my own business." He was never going to find it hard to leave the trader lifestyle behind. While some of his 
colleagues splashed out on Maseratis and Ferraris, Mr Fitz-pat-rick bought a used Volkswagen Golf on eBay. 
Having left a few months before Lehman Brothers collapsed, he watched the news on Bloomberg TV with his wife 
while travelling in Botswana. "It was surreal."
Back in rural Gloucestershire, plans for Ovo took shape. Before leaving his City job Mr Fitzpatrick had visited the 
offices of Elexon, the company responsible for overseeing the arrangements that enable selling and trading of 
generated electricity in England and Wales, to test his business plan. He had also visited Ofgem to learn about the 
licensing conditions. Getting regulatory approval was laborious and expensive. Nine months passed before Ovo got 
a licence. In what he des-cribes as "an eye-opener", he had to buy £2m worth of electricity in advance but then 
realised Ovo did not have the right licence to receive it. "It took a lot of fixing," he sighs.
Even with its high upfront costs, Ovo was self-funded with savings and proceeds from selling the couple's London 
home. They own the business outright.
Ovo was officially launched in September 2009. The strategy, he says, was to be sure the foundations were 
properly in place so the start-up could cope with fast growth. The company has upgraded its IT systems and hired 
new senior managers. It is assembling a board of advisers and bringing in an outside investor to take a 15-20 per 
cent stake. His own role at Ovo is likely to change, he hints, noting that "pretty soon" his founder skills will not be 
right for managing an increasingly complicated business. Energy will remain his focus, though, inc-l-ud-ing how to 
generate more renewable energy at a lower price and how to in--c-rease energy efficiency. Any new bus--iness 
"might be a subsidiary, might not"; he will not divulge more.
In his role of challenger, Mr Fitzpatrick says the root of the problem in domestic energy supply is that the big six rely 
heavily on customers that never switch: many have been with the same supplier since privatisation in the mid-
1980s. "They are maximising their profits, they charge the most to people they don't think will switch." He is careful 
not to accuse the big companies of being a cartel but says they are "all the same".
Power to the people
Most of the UK's largest energy suppliers an-noun-ced rises in household bills ahead of winter. After being widely 
criticised, they have now said they will reduce the rises after the government promised changes to some of its 
green energy schemes that it said could cut annual household bills by £50.
Ovo had already announ-ced an offer to help customers cut their monthly bills. They pay at the start of the month 
for what they expect to use; now they will be able to reduce their monthly direct debit themselves if they anticipate 
using less than usual. If the customer is wrong, the company takes the difference the next month.
Combative and quick-witted, Mr Fitz-patrick goes on the attack at any suggestion that smaller suppliers have lower 
costs because they do not have to pay any of the social or green levies enforced by the government to subsidise 
low-income households and to support the UK's nascent renew-ables industry. "Oh, stop it. Is this Phil Bentley's 
question? Where is he?" he jokes, looking around as if to spot the former head of British Gas lurking in the 
restaurant.
Then he's off again, in his element, relishing his battle to challenge the status quo.
Switching on
Stephen Fitzpatrick on breaking into a highly regulated market dominated by a few incumbents
 Bureaucracy: "I spent 18 months poring over hundreds of policy, legislation and licence documents and 
organising meetings with regulators who did not take me seriously at first. The day I received Ovo's supplier 
licence, which allowed us to sell gas and electric, was the day people started taking notice."
 Finance: "Before I left the City I calculated I would need around £400,000 to set up Ovo and start trading. It turned 
out to be about right, but things were very tight."
 The incumbents: "We've had to work hard to get every single one of our customers. The big six inherited most of 
theirs post-privatisation."

Ryanair has not offered to take part in Italian airline Alitalia's poorly received 300 million euro capital increase, the 
chief executive of the Irish budget carrier said today.
After a lukewarm response to its emergency cash call, Alitalia has been left with the prospect of literally running out 
of fuel before next summer unless it can get top shareholder Air France-KLM or some other investor to invest and 
help revamp its fleet.
Speaking at a news conference in Rome, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said if his airline were asked to join 
Alitalia's cash call currently earmarked only for shareholders "we would evaluate" the possibility.
But the chance of Alitalia letting Ryanair invest in its capital are slim after the carrier last week rebuffed an offer 
from Ryanair to feed passengers into its long-haul routes and help boost Alitalia's profitability. Alitalia then said it 
had its own restructuring plan in place and suggested the two firms were not natural partners. Cash-strapped 
Alitalia has so far raised less than two thirds of the capital wanted from the share sale and will rely on Italy's state-
owned postal service and other investors to come up with the rest. Even with a successful cash call, analysts said 
the airline, which loses around 700,000 euros a day and has net debt of more than 800 million euros, may have to 
ground its fleet within six months unless a strong investor can be found. O'Leary said Alitalia could be restructured, 
but the airline was suffering from too much political meddling, too many strikes and an inadequate fleet. Today's 
Alitalia is much leaner than the group that was rescued and privatised in 2008, but a focus on the domestic and 
regional markets have left the airline vulnerable to competition from low-cost carriers and high-speed trains. Last 
month Alitalia's board approved a revised business plan, promising deep cuts to make the airline more competitive. 
Alitalia and Italy's government have been hoping that a strong airline such as Lufthansa, Etihad Airways or Russia's 
Aeroflot would come to its rescue, but all three have said they were not interested in Alitalia right now. Air France-

Warren Buffett's declaration that the way to become a millionaire was to make a billion and then buy an airline has 
long dogged aviation stocks . Throw in the usual caveats about being a minority investor beside a politically 
motivated, state-owned majority shareholder. Add, too, the legal and regulatory vagaries associated with Bric 
countries and investors might want to give Russian airline Aeroflot a wide berth.
Still, its share price was up almost 5 per cent yesterday on the back of good third-quarter earnings numbers. That 
stretches the gain this year to 40 per cent, compared with a 4 per cent rise for MSCI's Russian index. Moreover, 
Aeroflot's 2014 price-earnings multiple, on consensus estimates, is about 6. That's as cheap as it gets in the airline 
sector.
The bull case rests on Russia's rising demand for air travel - a factor in recent route additions to St Petersburg and 
Moscow by discount carriers EasyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air. According to Deutsche Bank, Russian passenger 
traffic grew at a 10 per cent compound annual growth rate between 2000 and 2012, with only a brief crisis dent. 
With Russian mobility levels well below western Europe's but spending on recreation and tourism rising, Deutsche 
reckons a CAGR of 7.5 per cent between 2012 and 2020 is possible. Cost efficiency is also a big plus at Aeroflot. 
On a unit cost basis the carrier is already at the low end of industry scales, but still saw a 5 per cent drop, year-on-
year, in 2013's first nine months (including fuel). Ticket prices and traffic rose; earnings before interest, 
depreciation, amortisation, tax and lease costs were up by a half.
Aeroflot
Still, there are big caveats. Airport congestion could check growth; net debt, although falling, is 1.7 times ebitda; 
subsidiaries are still being integrated. There has also been talk of a state share sale (it owns 51 per cent) but 
nothing firm. And defying Mr Buffett's advice is always a risk.

Section: LEGAL ASPECTS OF AVIATION FINANCE,BLOG
Length: 902 words
Byline: Timothy McIver
Body
2013 saw a number of significant decisions being taken by the European Commission ("EC") and national 
competition authorities in Europe that affected the commercial aviation sector.
In October, the EC approved the acquisition of Olympic Air by Aegean Airlines. The same deal had initially been 
blocked in early 2011 for reasons including the near monopoly the combined carrier would have on domestic 
routes. With possible implications for other loss-making carriers, the EC subsequently approved the acquisition on 
the basis that the deterioration in the financial situation of Olympic meant it would shortly have exited the market, as 
well as in light of the overall decline in the Greek market.
Eight months prior to this clearance, the EC prohibited the acquisition of Aer Lingus by its minority shareholder 
Ryanair for the second time. A separate investigation into Ryanair's 29.8% shareholding by the UK's Competition 
Commission ("CC") resulted in a finding of a significant lessening of competition between the airlines on routes 
between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.
The CC is currently consulting on possible remedies, favouring a reduction of Ryanair's shareholding to 5% and a 
commitment not to seek board representation. Ryanair's appeal against the CC's decision will be heard in early 
2014 and it also has an appeal pending against the EC prohibition.
These decisions tell us a number of things about how much more consolidation will be allowed in the airline sector 
in Europe and on what terms.
First, the thresholds that determine whether an applicable regulator has jurisdiction to review a merger are typically 
turnover-based, with few exceptions. That means any merger between airlines over a certain size can be expected 
to attract regulatory review by the competition authorities in the EU. 
Second, passenger airlines typically operate in concentrated markets. In the EU, the top five carriers - Air France-
KLM, International Aviation Group, Lufthansa, Ryanair and easyJet - held an estimated c.52% market share 
between them (by seating capacity) in 2012. The nature of the industry also means that their actions are directly felt 
by consumers. Those factors alone mean that aviation sector mergers can be expected to attract detailed 
regulatory scrutiny. 
Aviation Consolidation
Third, there have been a sufficient number of EU decisions for the broad substantive analytical framework to be 
largely settled. In general terms, the relevant market for scheduled passenger air transport services has traditionally 
been defined by the EC on the basis of the "point of origin/ point of destination" ("OD") city-pair approach, and the 
different possibilities available to consumers to travel between these destinations.
Each OD city pair is considered to constitute a distinct market. Other factors that get taken into account include the 
demands of different types of passenger, in particular their time (i.e. price) sensitivity.
Fourth, it is possible to remedy competition concerns by offering to divest certain routes and take-off and landing 
slots. The analysis entails a route-by-route assessment of the actual and potential competitive effects that can be 
expected from the merger.
As a statement of the obvious, the fewer competing airlines there are and the more routes those carriers fly on, the 
more likely it is that a transaction will result in there being a number of anticompetitive city pairs. That is particularly 
the case where two airlines are based in the same country or at the same "~home' airport, and are therefore likely 
to be closer competitors.
However, the practical ability to address substantive regulatory concerns diminishes the greater the number of 
routes that need to be divested.
The EC has considered 16 airline cases since the EU Merger Regulation ("EUMR") came into effect in 2004. Whilst 
only three of those have been prohibited, that accounts for 60% of all cases ultimately blocked by the EC under the 
EUMR. The reason for that is largely because of the difficulty in coming up with a solution that ensures another 
carrier will exert a credible competitive constraint on the affected routes. 
Fifth, the legal landscape is changing. It has always been open to the parties to argue that efficiency gains may 
counteract any negative effects on competition. Such efficiencies must be likely to benefit consumers (e.g. costs 
savings resulting in lower ticket prices), be merger specific and empirically verifiable.
To date the EC has never accepted such arguments in a merger context and rejected them in bothRyanair/ Aer 
Lingus and Olympic/ Aegean Airlines. It recently appeared more open to doing so in an antitrust context, however, 
when addressing competition concerns related to the Star Alliancerevenue-sharing joint venture on the Frankfurt-
New York route.
Meanwhile, the Aegean/ Olympic II decision means we can also expect new interest in the application of the so-
called "failing firm" defence to rescue mergers as a possible way through the regulatory issues. A loss-making 
carrier such as Alitalia could in theory be in a position to run a similar argument to Olympic, were they to be a 
potential acquisition target.
Finally, the EC's June consultation on whether to extend merger control to catch the acquisition of non-controlling 
minority shareholdings is another factor that could have a significant impact on this sector in terms of increased 
oversight and intervention.

Ryanair has continued to try to change its image from nasty to nice.
From Sunday, all Ryanair passengers may now bring a second small carry-on bag on board, while its boarding card 
reissue fee has been cut from E70/£70 to E15/£15 for customers who have already checked-in online.
These latest customer service improvements have been rolled out across the entire Ryanair network and follow the 
launch of the new Ryanair.com home page, 24 hour grace periods (for minor booking errors) and the introduction of 
quiet flights (pre-8am and post-9pm) without that irritating fanfare for arriving on time.
Standard airport bag fees are to be cut from E60/£60 from 3rd January and fully allocated seating (from 1st 
February) is already in place. Ryanair will also introduce a "My Ryanair" passenger registration system at the end of 
December, allowing faster bookings, which will be followed by a "Share the Fare" feature, allowing passengers to 
share fares via social media, a "Fare Finder" feature, where customers can search for fares via price point, route or 
travel period, and the implementation of mobile boarding passes. New business and family products are also being 
developed, along with a new mobile app, tailored country-specific websites (starting with Italy and Spain) and a 
mobile-responsive website. Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: "Ryanair is continually striving to improve our passenger 
experience and we are very excited at these significant improvements to our industry leading customer service. We 
are actively listening and responding to our customers so that they can continue to expect low fares and on-time 
flights, but can now enjoy a second small carry-on bag and reduced boarding card reissue fees for those who have 
checked-in online, along with easier website access, 24 hour grace periods and quiet flights, with further 
improvements set to be rolled out over the coming months."

Value to local economies means many are seen as too big to fail, writes Jane Wild
Body
When Holyrood completed its takeover of Glasgow Prestwick at the weekend - the second UK airport to be 
nationalised this year - it highlighted the plight of many regional airports.
Prestwick's sale by infrastructure investment firm Infratil for just £1 to the Scottish government after a commercial 
buyer could not be found hammered home how tough conditions are in the airport industry.
But the government's intervention also illustrated the value of airports to the local economy, supporting thousands 
of jobs and generating hundreds of millions of pounds of economic activity for their region.
As with Prestwick, for many it is a case of airports being too big to fail, and industry experts say others are likely to 
follow it into government ownership.
"Airports are really important parts of the community in terms of contributing business and enterprise," says Chris 
Peaker, director of transport advisory practice at KPMG.
Regional airports squeezed by drop in prices and traffic TRAVEL & LEISURE
"People underestimate this local and regional importance and the ability of the public sector to ultimately step in and 
save some of the smaller regional airports."
The number of passengers using Prestwick, which is a hub for Ryanair, halved in the past five years and its 
recovery will depend on attracting another big airline customer.
Paul Kehoe, chief executive of Birmingham airport, says nationalisation is not the answer. "If you're nationalising - 
like Prestwick and like Cardiff - then something's not working. Governments shouldn't have to interfere."
But he says: "To see [Cardiff and Prestwick] fail would have been complete disaster."
Cardiff, which was nationalised in March is now run through an arm's-length operation, which is hoping to steer it 
back to profitability in the face of competition from nearby Bristol airport.
A number of airports have some local authority involvement, such as Newcastle and Birmingham, which are run as 
publicprivate partnerships including local councils.
Of the UK's 60 airports, the top six - Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Stansted, Luton and Edinburgh - account for 
more than 70 per cent of passengers, leaving the rest vying for a relatively small market share.
Some have not survived: Plymouth and Bristol Filton airports have closed in the past two years.
Jon Moulton , the venture capitalist, says there are simply too many airports.
"There are very few really profitable airports in the UK," he says.
"The thing that the industry needs - whether it be Prestwick, Cardiff, or others - is for some of these airports to 
close, and permanently."
He likens overenthusiastic airport investors to the wealthy individuals who bail out third division football clubs.
The proliferation of regional airports means many have overlapping catchment areas, intensifying the scrabble for a 
limited pool of travellers.
Prestwick's nationalisation, for example, has prompted concern from businesses that nearby Glasgow airport could 
suffer. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce has demanded assurances from the government that it will not favour 
Prestwick over its neighbour.
"The problem we have is that the consumer is getting a great deal at the moment from airlines, and airlines are 
clearly passing the economic pressure on to airports," says Mr Kehoe. "The pressure is such that many airports are 
having to slash or hold their aeronautical charges to keep airlines in and that feeds through the system. It's not 
sustainable. Airports will go out of business."
In addition, many airports are failing to meet optimistic business plans drawn up before the recession, analysts say.
Chris Tarry, an aviation analyst, says: "Before the last downturn, eight to 10 years ago, everybody got very excited 
about airports and some of them overpaid."
However, airports remain popular assets, particularly with investment funds. "They are not massively high-margin 
businesses but they should generate cash," Mr Tarry says.
Regional airports are also being touted as a solution to increase the UK's flight capacity.
Manston airport in Kent, which has handled about 28,000 passengers this year, was sold by Infratil to Ann Gloag, 
who founded transport group Stagecoach with her brother Brian Souter.
The airport has pitched an expansion plan to the Davies commission looking at capacity growth .
Regional airports squeezed by drop in prices and traffic TRAVEL & LEISURE
Charles Buchanan, Manston chief executive, says: "UK regional airports, in particular of the southeast, have a vital 
role to play in satisfying the growing demand for airport capacity because it's going to take many, many years to 
build any new infrastructure."
Some have diversified to thrive - such as Southend , which deals with freight and passengers - or looked at 
revenues from assets such as property.
"It's inevitable that regional airports will be looking at their businesses," said Colin Smith, partner at PwC.
"As in any market-driven economy, there will be some that turn out to be uncompetitive. There will only be relatively 
few who can rely on rescues from local governments and cash-strapped councils."

Ryanair is to start flying from Brussels' main airport, more than 30 kilometers closer to the city than its current base, 
in a shift to more mainstream airports traditionally dominated by higher-cost rivals.
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, Ryanair has in the past used smaller, regional airports but says 
large airports are offering it more competitive deals as they try to replace capacity cut by legacy carriers.
The shift comes as Ryanair overhauls its customer service model to attract business travellers, who are often willing 
to pay a premium for more convenient airports and perks such as flexible tickets and free baggage allowances.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has said his airline had fallen behind rival easyJet, which has had success in 
attracting higher-paying travellers through its use of allocated seating and more mainstream airports. Ryanair will 
serve 10 routes from a new base at Brussels Zaventem Airport, which is 7 miles (11 km) from central Brussels, but 
will also continue to operate from its current base at Brussels Charleroi, 30 miles (50 km) from the capital. Ryanair 
moved into Charleroi in 1997 and made the airport its first base in continental Europe. Rivals tried to stop Ryanair 
from using the word Brussels when advertising flights to Charleroi due to the airport's distance from the city, but it 
won permission from the International Air Transport Association. On Tuesday, Ryanair announced new routes from 
Rome Fiumicino, Italy's largest airport and it has also announced new routes at the main international airports in 
Lisbon and Prague. "This strategy ties in nicely with its bid to target frequent flying and higher yielding business 
passengers with services to and from more mainstream airports," Goodbody analyst Donal O'Neill, said.

Body
The European Central Bank has said the Government would need to seek and receive a new round of formal aid 
from the European Stability Mechanism rescue fund before it could consider buying Irish bonds to stabilise a crisis.
In remarks to The Irish Times, ECB executive board member Jorg Asmussen said leaving the bailout without a 
credit line meant Dublin did not meet conditions for the bank to buy Irish debt under its bond-buying programme.
Mr Asmussen's intervention, in response to questions to a bank spokesman, comes after Minister for Finance 
Michael Noonan said Ireland was neither at an advantage nor disadvantage over the ECB's Outright Monetary 
Transactions initiative. "Ireland would need to apply for a new EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme 
or precautionary programme to be considered for OMT."
Mr Asmussen is a central figure in Ireland's bailout and exit strategy. His remarks suggest OMT aid could not be 
considered without a precautionary credit line or a full-blown rescue programme, with conditions required in both 
cases. The Irish Times XXXX The rate of employment growth accelerated during the third quarter of 2013, 
according to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office. There was a year-on-year increase in employment 
of 3.2per cent, or 58,000, for the third quarter of this year as compared with the same quarter last year, according to 
the Quarterly National Household Survey results. Total employment rose to 1,899,300. The 3.2 per cent year-on-
year rise compares with an increase of 1.8 per cent for the previous quarter, 1.1 per cent for the first quarter and 0.1 
per cent for the last quarter of 2012. A comparable rate of increase in employment was last seen at the end of 
2007, Brian Ring of the CSO told a media briefing yesterday. The household survey figures are the official or

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) announced it would open its 2nd Belgian 
base (62 in total) at Brussels Zaventem in Feb 2014 with 4 based aircraft and 10 new routes to Alicante, Barcelona, 
Ibiza, Lisbon, Malaga, Palma, Porto, Rome, Valencia & Venice, which will deliver up to 1.50 million passengers p.a. 
and sustain some 1,500 "on-site" jobs at Brussels Zaventem with up to 200 weekly flights.
Ryanair celebrated its new Brussels Zaventem base and 10 new routes by releasing 100,000 seats on sale at 
prices from 15.99 pounds for travel in January and February, which are available for booking until midnight 
Thursday (28 Nov).

BRITAIN'S railways could carry more commuters without spending billions on upgrades if trains offered third-class 
carriages with almost no seats, a report out yesterday claimed.
Passengers could pay a fifth less to travel in a "high-density" section that would be modelled on the London 
Overground carriages, the paper by transport expert David Starkie for the Institute of Economic Affairs argued.
Introducing a low-cost option on the railways would bolster capacity in the same way that Ryanair and EasyJet 
opened up aviation, he said.
"Giving people more choice and encouraging more competition could save the taxpayer considerable amounts of 
money and at the same time offer lowercost travel options to commuters," said Richard Wellings of the IEA.
While proposals for a thirdclass option have already been floated in some of the recent rail franchise competitions, 
the Department for Transport has distanced itself from the idea of lower standards.

The ISEQ rebounded in early deals this morning in line with a general rally on global markets with European indices 
heading towards a five-year high.
The ISEQ rose 21.96 points to 4,463.92.
European shares headed towards a five-year high and Germany's DAX set a new record today, with airline stocks 
and French car makers getting a big boost from a breakthrough nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. The 
deal, which will relax some western sanctions against Iran initially in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear 
programme, reduced the chance of military action against Iran, easing geopolitical tension and lifting risk appetite in 
markets globally.
Shares in Aryzta weighed on the Irish market with stocks down 20c to E54.80. The company this morning posted 
strong revenue growth in its European division in the 13 weeks to the end of October and said that it remains on 
tract to deliver double-digit full year growth. Revenues increased by 17.6pc, to E377.6m in its Food Europe 
business while revenue in its Food North America business dropped 0.9pc to E364.2m. Its Rest of the World 
division saw revenues fall 7.4pc to E54.5m. Total revenue for its food businesses was up 6.5pc to E796.3m 
(£665.14m). Owen Killian, chief executive, Aryzta, said the group remained on track to "substantially complete its 
transformation programme" by the end of the 2014 financial year and that the group was well placed to "take 
advantage of potential consolidation opportunities across the sector". Kingspan held a capital markets day on 
Friday last, providing an outline of how it sees itself evolving over the coming years. "It is clear that market share 
gains, new product development and geographic expansion are at the core of the group's philosophy. Kingspan has 
begun to rebuild profitability in recent years and we expect earnings momentum to accelerate as construction 
markets recover. The stock may not look cheap on near-term multiples but this is a compelling medium-term story 
that merits a premium rating," said Davy. Shares in the Cavan-based group dipped 1c to E12.68. Among the risers

Enterprise Inns (ETI)
Travel & leisure
The shares look cheap on a forward p/e ratio of eight. As the economy improves, Enterprise only needs to 
tough it out a bit longer
The retirement of Enterprise Inns founder and chief executive, Ted Tuppen, after more than 20 years at the helm, 
has led to inevitable questions over which direction the pub group will now take. But on the evidence of these 
results, Mr Tuppen leaves his successor with a much better inheritance - debt is firmly under control and 
operational performance is improving. Like-for-like net income was down by 2.9 per cent for the period, but this was 
an improvement on the 4.2 per cent decline the company experienced in the weather-affected first half.
The company's debt situation also looks more stable after the proceeds from the sale of unwanted pubs helped to 
cut the net debt burden by £216m to £2.5bn. But the freehold estate was revalued at £3.97m, forcing the company 
to take a non-cash charge of £139m.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM THIS WEEK'S INVESTORS CHRONICLE
Deutsche Bank forecasts adjusted pre-tax profits of £120m for 2014, giving earnings per share of 18.6p, compared 
with £121m and 19p last time.

SELL
Paddy Power (PAP)
Travel & leisure
With sentiment still fragile the shares are best avoided - despite the company's history of innovation and 
enviable record of returns
Ryanair is not the only Irish company having a spot of bother with profit warnings .
Shares in Paddy Power, which trade in both London and Dublin, dived by almost 10 per cent at one point after its 
second alert of the year .
The bookmaker, also famed for its cheeky publicity stunts, has been hit by a long run of unfavourable sporting 
results, particularly from horse racing in Australia and Champions League football. These added to Andy Murray's 
Wimbledon triumph, which hit its first-half performance.
The betting losses in the period amounted to EUR10m (£8.4m), which will probably knock about EUR11m from 
operating profits for the year.
The forecast for operating profits growth in 2013 of low- to mid-single digits was largely maintained, but the 
prospect of profits only hitting the low end of that range is now a real possibility. On the bright side, the company's 
online businesses kept growing at double-digit rates.
JH
HOLD
Petrofac (PFC)
Oil services
Despite fears of a sector-wide slowdown, we continue to see value both in the sector as a whole and in 
Petrofac's shares
Shares in Petrofac tumbled 15 per cent after the oil services group said two significant contracts have been delayed 
, hitting earnings expectations.
In Abu Dhabi, the Upper Zakum field development is being re-engineered and this will result in revenues being 
deferred "from 2014 into 2015 and beyond".
A "rephasing" of the Berantai development project in Malaysia will result in a deferral of revenues "from 2014 to 
later years".
Petrofac said it now expects "flat to modest growth" in 2014 and indicated it will need to win extra contract awards 
in order to meet its existing 2015 target of earnings per share of $2.50 (156p), although 2013 estimates escaped 
unscathed. Petrofac's order backlog was also unchanged at $14.3bn. The company's shares trade on just 10 times 
forecast earnings.
Analysts from Investec expect to slash their earnings forecasts for 2014 and 2015 by 15 per cent and 10 per cent, 
respectively.

EasyJet 's McCall leads the way as women buck chief executive trend
EasyJet's McCall leads the way as women buck chief executive trend

Sometimes nice guys finish first. Or, in the case of easyJet, nice gals.
The UK-based budget airline this week unveiled sparkling results - full-year profits before tax up by half, on revenue 
growth of 10 per cent - and plans a £175m special dividend to reward its shareholders.
Since Carolyn McCall took over in 2010, the airline has gone from flying 50m passengers a year to 61m and has 
recently ordered 135 new Airbus A320 jets to cut its cost per seat and expand further. EasyJet has also pulled off 
the neat trick of adding services that generate revenue - such as assigned seats that can be bought in advance - 
while also making passengers happier.
Meanwhile, easyJet's Irish rival, Ryanair, has issued two profit warnings in as many months and recently gave in to 
shareholder pressure to change its customer-unfriendly ways . In just a few months, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's 
confrontational chief executive, has gone from revelling in the brand's "macho" culture to saying: "We should try and 
eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off."
Contrast that concession with Ms McCall's explanation this week of her airline's success: "It's in the DNA of easyJet 
to look after its passengers and it comes very naturally to the frontline; it comes very naturally to our pilots and our 
cabin crew."
EasyJet 's McCall leads the way as women buck chief executive trend
Is it any wonder that my family, like many others, routinely prefers easyJet to Ryanair when booking a European 
holiday? Investors seem to agree. In the past 12 months, easyJet's share price has more than doubled, while 
Ryanair is up 20 per cent.
Ms McCall's success looks easy now, but she deserves credit for carving her own path. When she took over, 
easyJet was feuding with its founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou over rights to the "easy" name, and Ryanair's cheaper-at-
all-costs strategy was the one winning plaudits from the analysts. Ms McCall repeatedly rebuffed opposition from Sir 
Stelios and took the unusual step, for a budget airline, of trying to attract more lucrative business travellers.
Perhaps her iconoclasm stems from the fact she came to easyJet from Guardian newspapers, rather than another 
airline. But I wonder if her gender might have something to do with it. Not because women are inherently "nicer" or 
more focused on customers but because female chief executives may be more willing to buck the prevailing trend.
With the planned departure of Burberry's feted leader Angela Ahrendts, Ms McCall is one of just two female CEOs 
of FTSE 100 companies, although utility Severn Trent has just appointed BT's Liv Garfield and newly listed Royal 
Mail, headed by Moya Greene, is likely to join the index. FTSE 100 boards are not known for their diversity - only 19 
per cent of members are female and 3.3 per cent are ethnic minorities.
Top women and minority executives cannot just blend into the crowd so they may be less prone to the problems of 
groupthink. Studies by the US advocacy group Catalyst suggest that big companies with the most women directors 
outperform those with the least, both in terms of return on sales and return on invested capital. These companies 
may just be lucky, but they also could be tapping a more diverse set of ideas. EasyJet's success under Ms McCall 
would tend to support the latter.

The index was up 4.56 points to 4,436.24.
European shares held steady while a closely watched measure of stock market volatility sank to a near seven-year

Ryanair stocks rose 4c to E5.71 after it announced 12 new routes from Stansted and a further 17 from April 2014. 
This is the first expansion out of Stansted since a ten-year deal was concluded with the new airport owner, 
Manchester Airport Group. This will add c.1.3m passengers and follows on from the 700,000 passenger growth plan

It has been a tough quarter for the minerals services companies, writes Bryce Elder  . Might John Wood Group be 
the next to disappoint?
Wood slipped 2.4 per cent to 789p after sector peer WorleyParsons slashed earnings forecasts by a fifth. Just six 
weeks after reaffirming guidance, the Australian group said it had been hit by a weak domestic mining industry, 
delays at Canadian oil sands projects, softer demand in Latin America and Middle East delays.
WorleyParsons' warning also hit Amec , its closest global peer, even though Amec had reassured on trading a day 
earlier. It lost 2.2 per cent to £11.58.
Precious metals miners led the wider market lower after gold hit a five-week low. The FTSE 100 fell 0.3 per cent, or 
16.93 points, to 6,681.08 with Randgold Resources leading declines on a 2.7 per cent loss to £44.95.
Aberdeen Asset Management rallied 3.5 per cent to 492p, continuing its volatile performance since agreeing to 
buy Scottish Widows' investment arm.
Merrill Lynch took Aberdeen off its "sell" list but still saw the stock fairly valued with expectations dependent on the 
integration going to plan.
John Wood slips as peer slashes earnings forecast LONDON
EasyJet rose 2.4 per cent to £13.77, with HSBC upgrading to "neutral". Recent results showed few signs that 
easyJet's strategic position had weakened, said the broker. "We continue to be concerned about the development 
of the low cost sector from duopoly to oligopoly and about the moves by BA and Ryanair to bring their product 
strategies closer towards that of EasyJet. However, these challenges do not yet seem to be impacting trading."
Telecom Plus surged 19.8 per cent to £18.05 after agreeing to pay £218m to buy back two energy units from 
NPower. Kentz rose 2.4 per cent to 555p after announcing a $190m contract with Qatar Petroleum.
Argos owner Home Retail Group crept 0.2 per cent higher at 191.4p after an upbeat presentation to HSBC's sales 
force, which concentrated on the rise of click-and-collect services instead of online delivery.
Plumbers' merchant Wolseley fell 0.6 per cent to £32.29 after a negative October reading for the US Architecture 
Billings index, an indicator for non-residential building work.

It has been a tough quarter for the minerals services companies. Might John Wood Group be the next to

Just six weeks after reaffirming guidance, the Australian group said it had been hit by a weak domestic mining 
industry, delays at Canadian oil sands projects, softer demand in Latin America and Middle East delays.
WorleyParsons' warning also hit Amec , its closest global peer, even though Amec had reassured on trading a day 
earlier. The company's shares lost 2.2 per cent to £11.58.
Wood's next update is scheduled for December 12. Its interim management statement last month flagged up 
subdued demand in Canada but kept full-year expectations unchanged. More than half of Wood's sales come from 
long-term maintenance contracts so a shock on the scale of WorleyParsons' looked highly unlikely, analysts said.
But they saw Wood and Amec facing increased competition as the Australian group's embattled management 
pushes to win lower-margin construction work.
Precious metals miners led the wider market lower after gold hit a five-week low. The FTSE 100 fell 0.3 per cent, or

Argos owner Home Retail Group crept 0.2 per cent higher at 191.4p after an upbeat presentation to HSBC's sales 
force, which concentrated on the rise of click-and-collect services instead of online delivery.
Argos's 740 stores were "effectively stock depots", so the company can become "the local delivery channel of 
choice" as spending moved back to the high street, HSBC said.
Plumbers' merchant Wolseley fell 0.6 per cent to £32.29 after a negative October reading for the US Architecture 
Billings index, an indicator for non-residential building work.
Among the small-caps, Exillon Energy held steady at 265p after the explorer urged shareholders not to react to 
news a vehicle controlled by Russian tycoon Mikhail Gutseriyev had this week bought a 14.9 per cent stake.
A regulatory filing after the close indicated Mr Gutseriyev had already sold the holding to bank a 10p per share

Intertek caution drags FTSE to a sub-6,700 close LONDON REPORT

BRITAIN'S top share index slipped yesterday, hurt by testing firm Intertek on worries over a slowdown in its 
business, though analysts were confident that technical support would cap any weakness in the broader market.
Intertek, a company specialising in safety and quality tests, fell 2.5 per cent after saying headwinds experienced in 
the first half of the year have continued into the second half.
Shore Capital kept a sell recommendation on Intertek, arguing that the company may have more downgrades to 
forecasts.
The FTSE 100 closed down 25.45 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 6,698.01 points, retreating further from a fivemonth 
high of 6,819 hit on 30 October. Volumes were light, with the index having traded just over three-quarters of its 90-
day daily average.
"Any downward drift I think is going to be a buying opportunity. You've got layered support," said Barclays Capital 
analyst Lynnden Branigan, referring to the November low at 6,613, the 50-day moving average at 6,607, and the 
100-day moving average at 6,565.
Valuations on UK equities are still above long-term averages, having gained nearly 14 per cent in 2013 on huge 
quantities of cash pumped into the financial sector by central banks.
The FTSE 100 now trades on a 12-month forward price/earnings ratio of 12.7 times, above its 10-year average of 
12 times, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows.
This is despite downbeat corporate results. Nearly two-thirds of European firms have missed revenue expectations 
in the current quarter, while 48 per cent have missed forecasts at the profit level, Thomson Reuters Starmine 
Intertek caution drags FTSE to a sub-6,700 close LONDON REPORT
shows. Some analysts believe that in 2014 the main driver for stocks will be a further improvement in the global 
economy rather than rising valuation multiples.
Meanwhile, Budget airline EasyJet jumped 7.1 per cent after it underlined its growing advantage over struggling 
Irish rival Ryanair, reporting annual profit at the top end of forecasts and returning cash to shareholders.
And engineer Amec rose 1.5 per cent after saying trading had been boosted by strong performances in the UK 
North Sea and the US Gulf of Mexico.
George Godber, who runs Miton Group's UK Value Opportunities Fund, said valuations in the market have become 
stretched but he too sees opportunities in cyclicals, namely from miners.

Imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery. So notch one up to easyJet when low-cost airline rival Ryanair 
decided to copy its move to assigned seating on all planes this month. Conversely, though, easyJet itself took a leaf 
out of the Irish carrier's book yesterday, when it unveiled a big special dividend (more than doubling its dividend 
yield to 6 per cent) on the back of a 50 per cent jump in pre-tax profits for the year to end-September.
All of which highlights a tricky issue: the extent to which these two discount carriers are similar or different. The 
biggest question comes on the demand side. Ryanair talks of softness in forward bookings, the main reason behind 
its two profit warnings and more benign attitude towards customers. Carolyn McCall, easyJet's boss, is having none 
of that: aside from shifts in holiday dates (such as Easter), booking levels are normal, she says. This may be 
explained partly by different route networks and exposure to flag carrier cutbacks. A third of easyJet's capacity 
touches on France, Italy and Switzerland, where available seats overall are still expected to fall this winter 
(compared with the general intra-European rise), allowing the UK carrier to up its capacity and grab share. True, 
another 9 per cent is in Spain where capacity is rising. But here, easyJet is pulling back, closing a Madrid base. 
Factor in, too, the UK airline's better suitability to business travel - more mainstream airports - and first-mover 
advantage in wooing affluent fliers with secure seating.
But the fightback by Ryanair, which retains cost advantages, will have an impact: a third of easyJet's capacity 
competes with its Irish rival on a city-pair basis although under 5 per cent in terms of direct routes. EasyJet shares 
have also outflown its rival's and, on 13 times 2013-14 earnings, are no longer cheaper. The gain is deserved. Still, 
going forward, Ryanair may yet have an edge left.

arch rival Ryanair for the first time in its history. It saw a 51 per cent rise in yearly pretax profits to £478m, and its 
shares also rose significantly, boosted by the company's plans to hand out £175m to shareholders through a 
special dividend payment.
Chief executive Carolyn McCall, whose gentle public persona is the polar opposite of caustic Ryanair boss Michael 
O'Leary, attributed the success to introducing allocated seating last autumn.
According to YouGov BrandIndex, the introduction of assigned seating has definitely made a difference. Since it 
was first announced, the airline's overall Index score has increased by six points. Twice as many people now say 
they see EasyJet as being good value, and its recommendation rating has gone from minus 0.7 to plus 4.8, 
indicating it has really upped its game in terms of word of mouth marketing.
But what of Ryanair? In recent months Ryanair has launched a new customer service strategy, and the oftreviled 
company's efforts do seem to be improving its image in the eyes of consumers.
Its Index score is up three points since the end of September, but at minus 38.3 it is leagues behind EasyJet, with a 
score of minus 0.5.
Ryanair's Buzz score, which measures whether consumers are hearing something positive or negative about the 
brand, has increased by a whopping 11 points in less than two months. However, whether it will eventually be able 
to translate that good buzz into genuinely warm feelings among consumers remains to be seen.
Allocated seating pays off for mild-mannered McCall
The bottom line is that the budget airline market in the UK is more competitive than ever before, and that is good 
news for consumers.

The battle for online punters has been getting ugly. That was how traders read a profit warning from Paddy Power , 
which put the rest of the bookmakers under pressure, writes Bryce Elder .
Paddy Power warned that rivals had increased marketing spend to bulk up ahead of tax changes, meaning its UK 
growth had been slower than expected. The bookmaker fell 8 per cent to 57.5p.
Ladbrokes , down 1.8 per cent to 175p, was forced to deny last week that poor results meant it was heading 
towards a fifth profit warning.
Meanwhile, strong figures from Paddy Power's Australian business sparked worries that it may be picking up 
market share from William Hill , which slipped 2 per cent to 361.3p.
The wider market turned lower for the first day in four, with the FTSE 100 down 25.45 points or 0.4 per cent at 
6,698.01.
Aberdeen Asset Management lost 3 per cent to 475.2p, having jumped 14.7 per cent a day earlier in response to 
its £550m purchase of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership . Numis, which cut Aberdeen off its "buy" list, said 
Swip was "likely to at best be a no-growth business for a number of years".
Intertek fell 2.5 per cent to £31.02 after the testing specialist cut growth and margin guidance.

Vodafone drifted 1 per cent to 232.1p in spite of Citigroup giving takeover theories yet another airing.
Calling Vodafone a "unique strategic asset" with £20.2bn of tax losses on its balance sheet, it reckoned any 
successful bid would need to be pitched at about 290p a share.
Easyjet led the blue-chip risers, up 7.1 per cent to £13.45. A reassuring outlook statement came with its final 
results, which was in contrast to Ryanair's profit warning two weeks earlier.
Enterprise Inns jumped 11.6 per cent to 154p in spite of the retirement of its founder and chief executive Ted 
Tuppen.
Oil explorer Afren was up 8.1 per cent to 161p after saying a discovery was nearly four times bigger than the pre-
drill estimate.
Thomas Cook climbed 5 per cent to 147.5p as Credit Suisse advised buying ahead of results and a strategy 
update due next week. It expected Thomas Cook to set out a target for second-wave cost savings.

EASYJET shareholders welcomed a £175m special dividend yesterday after the budget airline's move into 
allocated seating helped push profits up a whopping 51 per cent.
The FTSE 100 firm said revenues per seat were up seven per cent, surpassing a four per cent rise in passengers, 
as reserved seats and other add-ons proved popular.
Boss Carolyn McCall said retirees, families and business travellers that spurned EasyJet in the past are now buying 
tickets, pushing the average age of the firm's passengers to 40.
Pre-tax profits soared 50.9 per cent to £478m, at the top end of forecasts, while revenues rose 10.5 per cent to 
£4.26bn.
The special dividend is on top of an ordinary dividend of £133m, and comes two years after EasyJet started 
returning money to shareholders.
"Another victory for all the shareholders of EasyJet," said Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the firm's founder and biggest 
investor. "The directors have now accepted that more money has to be returned to the shareholders - if only they 
would accept that less cash should go to Airbus for more planes."
McCall told reporters that the company has the financial firepower to both invest in growth and return funds, ending 
the year with £1.2bn in cash.
McCall said EasyJet is "paranoid about competition from wherever it comes", but that the former flag carriers like 
Air France are the rivals on EasyJet routes rather than Ryanair, which has recently issued two profit warnings.

She added that the firm's business model is hard for traditional airlines to copy: "They work in very nice offices - 
they don't work in a hangar in Luton."
ANALYST VIEWS ARE YOU PLEASED WITH EASYJET'S RESULTS? By Marion Dakers TREVOR GREEN 
AVIVA INVESTORS As shareholders in EasyJet, the final results and outlook statement provided us with further 
evidence that the strategy being implemented by Carolyn McCall is succeeding. She is also proving to be adept at 
balancing shareholder returns via a special dividend announcement along with a long term growth strategy.
GERT ZONNEVELD PANMURE GORDON " We remain optimistic about the long term prospects of this business. 
We are not concerned about longer term pricing pressure as there does not appear to be significant new capacity 
entering the short haul market. The company has a strong structural cost advantage over most of its competitors.
WYN ELLIS NUMIS "Given the uncertainty in the market recently following the cautious updates from Ryanair and 
Dart we believe that this update is encouraging. For 2014 trading and comps are tougher but we believe that 
EasyJet is continuing to make good progress.

The battle for online punters has been getting ugly. That was how traders read a profit warning from Paddy Power , 
which put the rest of the bookmakers under pressure.
Paddy Power warned that rivals had increased marketing spend to bulk up ahead of tax changes due to take effect 
next year, meaning its UK growth had been slower than expected.
"Desperation among sub-scale operators is starting to set in," said Davy analyst David Jennings. "While such 
behaviour is not sustainable, it is not likely to cease until some point post the introduction of UK online gaming tax in 
December 2014."
Paddy Power, down 8 per cent to 57.5p, also confirmed fears that horse-racing and football results had favoured 
the punters.
Ladbrokes , down 1.8 per cent to 175p, was forced to deny last week that poor results meant it was heading 
towards a fifth profit warning, but added that speculation about the remainder of the year was "extremely 
premature". The caveat baffled analysts, who noted that all the year's main events had already happened.
Meanwhile, strong figures from Paddy Power's Australian business sparked worries that it may be picking up 
market share from William Hill , which slipped 2 per cent to 361.3p.

Swip was "likely to at best be a no-growth business for a number of years".
Intertek fell 2.5 per cent to £31.02 after the testing specialist cut growth and margin guidance, blaming prolonged 
poor trading in Europe and weakness among minerals customers.
Vodafone drifted 1 per cent to 232.1p in spite of Citigroup giving takeover theories yet another airing.
"We regard AT&T and SoftBank among global telcos large enough to be credible potential bidders for Vodafone, 
with América Móvil as a candidate to take part of the company in a possible break-up," Citi said. Calling Vodafone a 
"unique strategic asset" with £20.2bn of tax losses on its balance sheet, it reckoned any successful bid would need 
to be pitched at around 290p a share.
Easyjet led the blue-chip risers, up 7.1 per cent to £13.45. A reassuring outlook statement came with its final 
results, which was in contrast to Ryanair's profit warning two weeks earlier.
Enterprise Inns jumped 11.6 per cent to 154p in spite of the retirement of its founder and chief executive Ted 
Tuppen.
Mr Tuppen's departure was confirmation that Enterprise had been "nursed back to good health", said Deutsche 
Bank, which added that it was the first time in five years that Enterprise's annual results had not triggered 
downgrades.
Oil explorer Afren was up 8.1 per cent to 161p after saying its Ogo discovery off the coast of Nigeria was nearly 
four times bigger than the pre-drill estimate.

McCall highlights contrast with other low-cost carriers as passenger numbers rise, says Jane Wild
Body
Carolyn McCall, easyJet chief executive, sees her airline as distinctly different to other low-cost carriers.
"We don't do things the way everybody else does them," she says.
While easyJet's rival Ryanair - for long the darling of the European airline industry for investors - has been forced to 
issue two profit warnings in as many months, blaming a weak economy and competition, easyJet has managed to 
fly well above the turbulence.
Since Ms McCall became chief executive in 2010, easyJet has gone from flying 50m passengers a year to 61m - 
earning her praise from industry analysts.
In March, the airline joined the FTSE 100 and Ms McCall navigated her way past opposition from easyJet's founder 
and largest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, to secure a new aircraft fleet order.
Investors seem to regard easyJet as different to other carriers, too. Its shares are up 75 per cent since the start of 
the year, in sharp contrast to Ryanair's, which have risen 18 per cent over the period, during which the company 
had to sharply change course on its customer service.
EasyJet chief declares: vive la difference TRAVEL & LEISURE
Having carved out a distinct identity Ms McCall repeatedly emphasises that difference. "Our differentiation is a 
really important part of what we do.
"And we'll remain different. We're less formal, we're more vibrant and our cabin crew smile a lot."
She adds: "No one is immune from economic conditions."
Much work has gone into developing and positioning the brand, she says, to make it "warmer, friendlier and more 
accessible", although she challenges the suggestion it has moved upmarket.
EasyJet appears to regard the flag carriers - Air France, British Airways, Alitalia - as its competition: it has said its 
opportunity lay in the 86m seats flown point to point by non low-cost carriers from Europe's top 20 airports. 
Business travellers remain a focus, but Ms McCall rules out changing easyJet's model by introducing a separate 
business class. "They get everything they want without us having to change the way we segment the aircraft or our 
seat configuration," she says. "That's when you start tampering with the model in my view, and that's what we 
would never do."
She says her priority is to increase yield by giving easyJet's 11m business travellers paid-for extras. WiFi will be 
offered, she says, because all other airlines will provide it.
In spite of these moves, she dismisses the risk of losing focus. "We're very clear about our strategy, we're very 
clear about what works and it's about delivering that relentlessly and improving what we do."
John Strickland, an aviation consultant, believes this clarity will be essential. "They've got to keep management 
focus and I think they can do it," he says. "It means keeping your eye on the ball. Carolyn McCall has got focus and 
has been able to unite the team. The risk is doing something differentiated and ending up undermining what they've 
done so far."
Even Sir Stelios has become less vociferous in protest over management decisions. Ms McCall is diplomatic: "Our 
relationship with easyGroup has always been constructive. We've had a really good dialogue with them."
Yesterday he praised the decision to pay the dividend: "Another victory for all the shareholders of easyJet PLC. The 
directors have accepted that more money has to be returned to shareholders - if only they would accept that less 
cash should go to Airbus for more planes."

EasyJet posted a sharp rise in profit and will pay a £175m special dividend to shareholders as the budget airline 
solidified its position in the European short-haul market.
Full-year profit before tax rose 51 per cent to £478m on revenues that were up 10 per cent to £4.26bn, the airline 
said yesterday.
A special dividend of 44.1p a share has been recommended by the board subject to approval at the company's 
annual meeting in February, on top of its existing 33.5p a share dividend, delivering on a longstanding demand from 
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, its largest shareholder.
"We've had a strong performance in 2013 and we've taken a number of actions to improve our competitive position 
and ensure we are a structural winner in European short-haul," said Carolyn McCall, chief executive. "Our strategy 
has delivered and will continue to deliver sustainable returns to shareholders."
EasyJet shares, which entered the FTSE 100 in March, rose 7.1 per cent to close at £13.45 yesterday. They have 
more than doubled over the past year.
The results stand in contrast with rival Ryanair, which has issued two profit warnings in two months, blaming 
competition and poor economic conditions.

Ms McCall said easyJet's customers returned because they liked what they were offered. EasyJet also differed from 
its rival, she said. "Our primary competition is actually the legacy carriers, that's who we're up against. In every 
single primary airport that we fly into it's about competing with Alitalia, Air France, British Airways, Lufthansa."
But the carrier was cautious about its winter outlook, citing restrictions on travel to Egypt. It forecast the overall 
market to grow 2 per cent and said it expected its costs per seat, excluding fuel, to rise 2 per cent over the year.
Ms McCall highlighted the fleet order which had helped control future costs, its stronger presence at Gatwick and 
customer satisfaction with allocated seating.
Operating profit rose 50 per cent to £497m and basic earnings per share were up 62.1 per cent to 101.3p. EasyJet 
said while it expected more competition from low-cost carriers, there was opportunity to take market share from 
other "less efficient" carriers.
John Strickland, an aviation consultant, said there was ample opportunity in the low-cost market. "At the moment 
both Ryanair and easyJet each account for single-digit shares of total traffic in Europe and as we see other legacy 
airlines cutting back or failing, they have plenty of room to grow. The bigger carriers just can't get the cost base or 
efficiency the low-cost guys already have."

Full-year profit before tax rises by 51%

EasyJet posted a sharp rise in profit and the budget airline will pay a £175m special dividend to shareholders amid 
signs it is solidifying its strong position in the European short-haul market.
Full-year profit before tax rose 51 per cent to £478m on revenues that were up 10 per cent to £4.26bn, the airline 
said -yesterday.
"We've had a strong performance in 2013 and we've taken a number of actions to improve our competitive position

The Luton-based airline's annual results stand in contrast with rival Ryanair, which has issued two profit warnings in 
the past two months, blaming competition and poor economic conditions.
Ms McCall said easyJet's -passengers liked what they were offered and became repeat customers.
She also sought to differentiate easyJet from other low-cost rivals. "Our primary competition is actually the legacy 
carriers, that's who we're up against. In every single primary airport that we fly into it's about competing with Alitalia, 
Air France, British Airways, Lufthansa."
Despite the upbeat results, easyJet executives were cautious about the winter outlook, citing restrictions on travel to 
Egypt. The airline forecast the overall market to grow 2 per cent and expected its costs per seat, excluding fuel, to 
rise about 2 per cent over the year.
Ms McCall highlighted the decision in July to order 135 Airbus A320 jets, saying it had helped to control future 
costs. She also cited easyJet's digital offerings and customer enthusiasm for assigned seating, which was rolled out 
across the fleet in November 2012.
"Our disciplined approach to capacity allocation has resulted in a meaningful growth in earnings, profit margin and 
return on capital employed, and we have ended the year with a strong balance sheet."
Full-year operating profit was up 50 per cent to £497m and basic earnings per share rose 62 per cent to 101.3p.
EasyJet said that while it expected more competition from the growth of low-cost carriers, there was opportunity to 
take market share from other "less-efficient" carriers.
John Strickland, an aviation consultant, said there was ample opportunity in the low-cost market. "The bigger 
carriers just can't get the cost base or efficiency the low-cost guys already have," he said.

British budget airline easyJet reported a sharp rise in annual profit and said it would pay a 175 million pound special 
dividend to shareholders, underlining its advantage over larger Irish rival Ryanair.
EasyJet's pretax profit rose 51 percent in the financial year ended September, helped by the introduction of 
allocated seating across its routes and strong revenues in many of its European markets.
Chief Executive Carolyn McCall said today that the airline, which carried 61 million passengers, offered "friendly 
service so that we can continue to win in a more competitive market."
EasyJet's upbeat assessment was in contrast to that given by Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline by 
passengers, which earlier this month cut its annual profit target for the second time in two months and admitted it 
needed to improve customer service. Europe's airlines are grappling with high fuel costs and weak consumer 
confidence, which have sent some smaller carriers including Spanair and Hungary's Malev out of business in the 
last two years leaving gaps for low-cost airlines to exploit. Older traditional airlines such as IAG, Air France-KLM 
and Lufthansa, are cutting jobs, renegotiating staff contracts and dropping uncompetitive routes to get costs down 
to similar levels as budget carriers. Shares in easyJet, which have doubled over the last year, were 7 percent higher 
at 1150 GMT on Tuesday, valuing the airline at more than 5 billion pounds. Ryanair was up 1.6 percent. Over the 
last three years Luton, southern England-based easyJet has added flights on routes where rivals have cut back, 
and introduced more flights between top business destinations. It has also added flexible ticketing to allow 
passengers to change their flight up to two hours before scheduled departure time and allocated seating in an 
attempt to steal corporate customers. Typically budget airlines have not given customers a numbered seat, 
resulting in a rush to board planes. EasyJet, which recently took over Flybe's slots at London's Gatwick airport, said 
it carried 11 million business passengers during the 2012/13 financial year, 1 million more than the previous year. 
"We are flattered by what our customers say about us and the results show the hard yards we have put in are

paying off," CEO McCall said. However, she warned that easyJet faces a challenge this winter as rivals add 
capacity. She expects European capacity to rise 2 percent in the first half, compared with a 4 percent fall last year. 
"EasyJet is setting expectation for a tougher 2014," said Jefferies analyst Mark Irvine-Fortescue, citing increased 
competition from new low-cost carriers looking to expand, such as Norwegian Air Shuttle and Vueling. "There will 
continue to be retrenchment by less efficient airlines," he said. EasyJet proposed a full-year dividend of 33.5 pence 
a share, 56 percent up on last year, and a special dividend of 44.1 pence per share, or 175 million pounds, taking 
its total payout to investors to 308 million pounds. It made an annual pretax profit of 478 million pounds (dollar 770 
million), while sales rose 10.5 percent to 4.26 billion pounds. (Reuters)

British budget airline easyJet reported a sharp rise in annual profit and said it would pay a 175 million pound special 
dividend to shareholders, underlining its advantage over larger Irish rival Ryanair.
EasyJet's pretax profit rose 51 percent in the financial year ended September, helped by the introduction of 
allocated seating across its routes and strong revenues in many of its European markets.
Chief Executive Carolyn McCall said today that the airline, which carried 61 million passengers, offered "friendly 
service so that we can continue to win in a more competitive market."
EasyJet's upbeat assessment was in contrast to that given by Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline by 
passengers, which earlier this month cut its annual profit target for the second time in two months and admitted it 
needed to improve customer service. Europe's airlines are grappling with high fuel costs and weak consumer 
confidence, which have sent some smaller carriers including Spanair and Hungary's Malev out of business in the 
last two years leaving gaps for low-cost airlines to exploit. Older traditional airlines such as IAG, Air France-KLM 
and Lufthansa, are cutting jobs, renegotiating staff contracts and dropping uncompetitive routes to get costs down 
to similar levels as budget carriers. Shares in easyJet, which have doubled over the last year, were 7 percent higher 
at 1150 GMT on Tuesday, valuing the airline at more than 5 billion pounds. Ryanair was up 1.6 percent. Over the 
last three years Luton, southern England-based easyJet has added flights on routes where rivals have cut back,

The FTSE 100 tracked U.S. and Asian stock markets lower today, with doubts setting in as to whether this year's

Shares in Easyjet (EZJ.L) leapt higher after the airline posted a 51% rise in profits and announced a special 
dividend but the wider FTSE 100 dropped lower as investors fretted over sustainability of this year's stock market 
rally.
All major European share indices were trading lower, with Britain's FTSE 100 down 0.5% to 6,690, amid fears that a 
market 'correction' is due.
Activist investor Carl Icahn stoked those fears yesterday when he said high valuations meant the 'market could 
easily have a big drop'.
Several fund managers have told Citywire how they are preparing for a sell-off. Fund manager Gervais Williams has 
taken outa 'put option,' a form of insurance, against the FTSE 100 amid growing fears that the market is set for a 
fall. Tim Stevenson, manager of the Henderson EuroTrust said earlier this month that he was 'cautious about 
markets in the short term' and a market fall of 5-10% may be triggered by some 'relatively irrelevant news'.
The jitters come as developed world shares have powered higher throughout 2013. Britain's FTSE 100 remains up 
some 13% so far this year, but has struggled so far in November amid doubts about the ongoing strength of the 
rally and uncertainty about how long the US Federal Reserve will keep spending $85 billion a month on its QE 
stimulus scheme.
Investors are looking ahead to Wednesday's minutes from the US Federal Reserve's November policy meeting for 
further direction.
Easyjet shoots higher Easyjet shone,shares up 6.3% to £13.35 after the airline reported a 51% rise in full-year, pre-
tax profits to £478 million.
Shareholders were also told to expect a special dividend of 44.1p per share in a £175 million hand out 'as evidence 
of continued confidence in the future prospects of the business'. That comes on top of the ordinary dividend of 
33.5p.
The news comes after two profit warnings from rival Ryanair and as market watchers expect price competition to 
heat up between airlines.
Easyjet is star turn as correction fears rock FTSE
'Given the uncertainty in the market recently following the cautious updates from Ryanair and Dart we believe that 
today's update is encouraging,' commented Numis analysts, who rate Easyjet shares a 'buy'.
Some analysts were concerned by the company's cautious outlook for next year.
Jefferies prefer Ryanair. 'As the high growth rates at easyJet and Ryanair taper, so attention turns to self-help 
opportunities, and to valuation we feel the catch up opportunities for Ryanair are more compelling, as it embarks on 
customer-friendly initiatives like revamping the digital offer and rolling out allocated seating.'
Ryanair (RYA.L)was trading up 0.6% at 5.51.
Among blue chip losers, Aberdeen Asset Management (ADN.L) let go of some of Monday's strong gains, when the 
funds company announced a deal to buy Swip off Lloyds. The shares fell 2.3% to 478p.
Intertek (ITRK.L), the product testing firm, fell nearly 5% to £30.31 after the firm announced profits that fell short of 
previous guidance

LAST week, EasyJet revealed that it had finished testing its volcano-busting aircraft sensors, allowing planes to 
dodge ash clouds and keep flying after eruptions like the one that crippled European airspace in 2010.
The experiment, which required EasyJet and its partners to throw a metric tonne of ash into the sky before flying 
four planes through it, is a neat demonstration of how the airline deals with a possible crisis.
Well before its budget rivals, EasyJet was offering hard-pressed business customers reserved seats and tickets 
through corporate travel agents. Now selling to everyone from Moscow businessmen to the Houses of Parliament's 
travel bookers, EasyJet's annual revenues per seat will be up by more than six per cent while traffic is four per cent 
up on last year. It also flagged a 10 per cent jump in non-seat revenues earlier in the year, helped by tie-ups with 
hotels and car hire firms attractive to busy corporate passengers.
Shares have fallen 15 per cent since a peak of 1,448p in August, as investors fret that consumer spending in 
Europe could falter and flatten sales - a fear already being realised at rival Ryanair.
However, EasyJet's early move to attract travellers trading down from flag carriers, and a dividend policy that has 
seen payouts increase since 2011, has kept most analysts on a "buy" rating.
By the time EasyJet has fitted its planes with its new volcano sensors, and it starts to use more costeffective Airbus 
A320neos in 2015, the stock will have flown past previous highs - Icelandic-sized ash cloud disasters permitting.

EASYJET is expected to smash through its profit record for the third year in a row tomorrow after its push into 
business travel and the introduction of new routes boosted turnover per passenger.
The low-cost airline said last month that it expected to report annual profits of between £470m and £480m, up from 
£317m the previous year, as revenues per seat rose six per cent.
The firm, which joined the FTSE 100 in March, introduced allocated seating on all of its flights in September 2012 
as part of its attempt to attract more business passengers.
Rival budget carrier Ryanair is now planning to roll out reserved seats after issuing two profit warnings this year and 
slashing autumn prices.
Numis analyst Wyn Ellis said EasyJet is well-placed to grow even further in 2014, due to its range of take-off slots 
across Europe's major airports, though he thinks the firm could be vulnerable to a "a temporary, and relatively 
minor, blip" in sales if the continent's economic recovery wobbles again.
"The structural drivers for EasyJet remain intact. Legacy carriers will continue to retrench. Business traffic, allocated 
seating and nonseat revenue will support revenue growth while cost discipline will protect and enhance profitability," 
Goodbody analyst Donal O'Neill said in a note to investors.

EasyJet  is flying high towards its full-year results on Tuesday , with a strong set of figures expected, writes Jane 
Wild .
The low-cost carrier joined the FTSE 100 in March and its shares have almost doubled, up about 93 per cent to 
1,265p, after peaking above that level in August.
Management statements will be of interest in building up a wider picture of the industry, after the weakness reported 
from other airlines, including low-cost carrier Ryanair. EasyJet's rival has recently followed its example and tried to 
grab back market share by adding allocated seating and adopting a friendlier attitude towards customers.
Analysts will also watch for progress in attracting business travellers, which have been wooed with extras.
There has been some pessimism, and the fear is that there is excess capacity in winter flights and that an 
increasingly competitive arena for low-cost operators could put pressure on profitability. But Deutsche Bank 
analysts said that despite the year-on-year increase in European capacity an analysis of easyJet's top 88 routes 
showed the outlook to be more benign.
In its trading update last month easyJet guided that its revenue-per-seat growth would be about 6 per cent and pre-
tax profit would be between £470m and £480m. The Reuters consensus of profit before tax is £544m.

Airline investors usually end up squeezed into a middle seat, well in the back. Lately they have been sitting, if not in 
first class, at least on the aisle. The sector generally performed well in 2012; in Europe, Bloomberg's sector index 
soared over 50 per cent. To an extent, this upward trajectory has continued in 2013. The index has risen another 
third, beating the Stoxx 600. That said, the ride has become bumpier since the summer.
This seems counterintuitive. Improving economies should boost travel demand. Restructuring at Europe's flag 
carriers should pay off eventually. Currency movements are not helpful, but fuel prices, while high, are edging 
down. All of this is true, up to a point. Demand does indeed seem to be picking up. A Morgan Stanley survey 
suggests most corporate travel managers expect bookings to increase in 2014, while IATA is making upbeat 
noises.
The big question is whether rises in demand will be trumped by increases in capacity. In the recession, capacity 
discipline kept ticket prices firm. But now specific capacity increases in the European low-cost market have been 
blamed for Ryanair's profit warnings .
Generally, though, the picture looks better: most forecasts suggest that capacity will grow next year, but that the 
rate of expansion should be in low single-digits, which would be far from calamitous. As for overhaul plans, these 
are at different stages. International Airlines Group is ahead of the game, but still managed to lift its target for 
synergies from recent acquisitions and its forecast for 2015 profits last week . By contrast, Air France-KLM and 
Lufthansa have further to go, and now face poor cargo trends, too.
Airlines upgraded
In short, there may still be altitude to be gained. But only one thing would really help keep the excess capacity 
threat off the radar: more consolidation, and the sooner the better. There is some hope. Alitalia's fate, for example, 
is up in the air .

Highlight: Airline says paying dividends a priority
View contrasts with Ryanair warnings
Body
International Airlines Group has lifted its profit target after an improved performance from British Airways and the 
integration of Spanish budget airline Vueling.
At its capital markets day yesterday, the carrier raised its 2015 operating profit target from EUR1.6bn to EUR1.8bn. 
The upgrade follows a strong third-quarter update a week ago.
The group said its main focus was on sustaining growth at between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, -excluding Vueling, 
beyond 2015.
Paying dividends was a priority, it said.
"We want to bring business to a -position where we can start paying dividends and all of the work we do is with that 
in mind," said Willie Walsh, group chief executive.
IAG's bullish statements stand in contrast with the picture from low-cost carrier -Ryanair, which has issued two 
profit warnings in the past two months, blaming a weak European economy and increased competition.
BA silver lining as IAG lifts target TRAVEL & LEISURE
Antonio Vázquez, chairman, said work to reshape Iberia was progressing, but more curtailing of costs would be 
needed, noting that the restructuring still posed a risk.
About 3,100 jobs are being cut at the Spanish airline, which last year made an operating loss of EUR351m.
BA, which has been strengthened by the -integration of BMI British Midland and has improved its margins, is 
forecast to show more improvement.
Its profit target for 2015 was lifted from £1.1bn to £1.3bn.
Some £800m of that would come from capacity growth, attracting more travellers by using data from its -website 
and bookings to identify customers by email and passport numbers, and provide more tailored offers.
The UK flag carrier outlined plans to replace its fleet, using Airbus A380s and Boeing 787s to unlock new long-haul 
routes.
Its transatlantic routes have performed strongly and short-haul services were already benefiting from the 
introduction of flexible pricing, such as hand baggage-only fares, it said.
Vueling, the Barcelona based budget carrier it acquired control of in April, is poised for more expansion of routes 
throughout Europe, building its presence.
IAG is aiming for earnings per share of more than EUR0.54, up from EUR0.52, and a return on invested capital of 
more than 12 per cent.
Its goal is to keep 2015 leverage at 55 per cent. Its cost savings target was raised to EUR650m by 2015, up from 
EUR560 a year ago.
Analysts at Credit Suisse said the upgraded profit target would fire more confidence in the group.
Shares in IAG, up 86 per cent this year, closed down 11p at 362.2p.
Dame Marjorie Scardino, who stepped down at the start of the year as chief executive of Pearson, parent company 
of the Financial Times, will join IAG's board in September, replacing John Snow.

Richard Milliken may have spotted a warning light in the cockpit when he was invited on to the Ryanair  board in 
June.
Chairman David Bonderman had sold shares four times in a week, parting with 17 per cent of his stake worth 
around £9m and the shares duly began their descent within a fortnight. Despite a PR offensive from chief executive 
Michael O'Leary , they have yet to pull out of the dive and have dropped almost a quarter since their peak. As the 
declines gathered pace last week, Mr O'Leary tucked into some humble pie and Mr Milliken bought a helping of 
shares for the first time on Wednesday. So far, he appears to have called the low.
Nitinbhai Amin, a senior manager at Aviva , is either very lucky or knows a bit about calling share-price lows. He 
made one of the best-timed trades of the year when the insurance group briefly slipped below 300p in April 
following weeks of declines. A research note from Morgan Stanley kick-started a dramatic reversal of sentiment with 
the shares bouncing 10 per cent by the time two non-executives bought in during May.
The gains were not exhausted until this month, when the shares peaked at 449p just before the St Jude's storm. 
Having joined the board two months ago, Michael Mire expects the gains to resume - he bought his first stake at 
440p on Monday.
Shares in London property group Winkworth have soared this year, tempting chairman Simon Agace to sell on the 
way up. At 127p his July trade was a long way shy of the August peak above 200p, but he remains the largest 
Turbulent times for Ryanair
shareholder with 45 per cent of the shares available. With a more modest stake, Anthony Snarey sold at 169p last 
week, parting with 90 per cent of his holding.

It is quite legitimate to be wary of a stock which has a high headline price tag, because if the high expectations 
implied by such a rating are not sustained, the downside can be painful.
However, sometimes paying a premium price can be worthwhile.
Last year's "genuine growth" screen, based on traditional valuation measures such as the price/earnings (p/e) ratio, 
delivered a stellar performance - and the best-performing stock was also the most expensive: Rightmove.
Shares in the property search website were on a forward p/e ratio of 25, yet it still managed to deliver a 73 per cent 
total return. Only one of the five shares (Telecity) underperformed the FTSE All Share.
My "genuine growth" screen attempts to find situations where growth and sentiment can be sustained and where 
good value is on offer once growth rates are taken into account.
The screen hunts for forecast upgrades, and the full criteria are as follows:
 Average earnings per share (EPS) growth rate, based on the historic three-year compound average growth rate 
and forecasts for the next two reporting years, of 15 per cent or more;
 Average forecast EPS growth for the next two reporting years of at least half the average three-year growth rate;
You get what you pay for Stock screens
 EPS forecasts higher today than they were three months ago;
 A price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio of less than one;
 Market capitalisation over £500m.
Again, only five shares made the grade. They are:
Housebuilder Berkeley can hardly be described as cheap compared with its peer group; its shares trade at a 
premium to book value. However, the company offers long-term earnings growth and a pledge to return £13 per 
share by 2021.
Like Berkeley, shares in property group CLS also trade at a premium to the value of the company's assets. But the 
company has been successful in raising property values and increasing rents, and the shares are below broker 
Liberum's year-end net asset value forecast.
The woes of rival airline Ryanair have weighed on easyJet lately, but analysts' forecasts were upgraded following a 
full-year trading update last month .
EasyJet said that good progress in the fourth quarter meant profits would be in the £470m-£480m range compared 
with previous guidance of £450m-£480m.
Wealth management group St James's Place has seen trading buoyed by the strength of the stock market, which 
has boosted assets under management and generated increased demand. Third-quarter sales rose 23 per cent 
year on year.
Trading news from Sports Direct has been very encouraging this year although management has been coy about 
pushing up earnings guidance. That hasn't stopped brokers from nudging up full-year forecasts, and there could be 
much more to come. As well as increasing sales, the group is expanding margins and pursuing growth opportunities 
in Europe.

JPMorgan Chase's hasty retreat from Twitter on Wednesday highlights the risks executives face when choosing to 
engage with the public via the microblogging site.
The US bank cancelled a live #AskJPM Q&A session with veteran dealmaker Jimmy Lee less than 24 hours before 
it was due to begin after being bombarded by users venting their anger at the bank.
JPMorgan might have foreseen the disaster had it watched the turbulence Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief 
executive, experienced when he hosted a live session with airline customers in October under the hashtag 
#GrillMOL.
Hundreds of irate tweets from passengers airing years of grievances did little to stop Mr O'Leary from answering 
back in his inimitable way.
Posing as a leprechaun with a flame-coloured beard, he spent the hour-long session flirting with female 
questioners, insulting customers and comparing himself with Superman and Jesus.
It was all worth it, according to Ryanair, which said it was "delighted" with the attention its Q&A session received 
and is considering hosting another one soon.
Noises off at #AskJPM underscore risks of Twitter engagement BANKS
British Gas may not be in such a hurry to repeat its debut in the Twittersphere after the utility whipped hundreds of 
Twitter users into a frenzy when it hosted a live Q&A chat on the same day it announced a 9 per cent price rise.
The minute #AskBG went live, it was hijacked by angry customers , with responses peaking at 1pm at 160 tweets a 
minute amid a torrent of negative comments. BG said it was committed to being open and transparent with 
customers at all times.
Not all company Q&A sessions have gone quite so badly. The Bank of England drew a warmer response from 
social media users when it made its first significant foray into social media in October.
Chief economist Spencer Dale manned a live session under the #AskBoE hashtag, answering 85 questions from 
inquisitors including economics students, financial market participants, academics and the general public.
Here's what two of the City's public relations experts think of JPM's Twitter gaffe:
John Waples, UK head of FTI Consulting Strategic Communications, said: "There is an inherent challenge in 
communicating complex issues through Twitter and finding the right balance in being open, transparent and 
protecting your brand. Twitter is a difficult channel on which to strike that balance and one where the conversation 
can't be controlled."
James Henderson, chief executive of Bell Pottinger said: " Twitter is an important part of our everyday working 
lives. We watch and listen all the time but it is a dangerous place to try to encourage debate on complex issues in a 
controversial sector."

National carrier experiences rapid expansion Turkey

Highlight: Growth is in step with diplomatic aims, writes Piotr Zalewski
Body
It has been quite a decade for Turkish Airlines. In 2003, the carrier, still a relative unknown, flew 65 aircraft, racked 
up less than 90m air miles, and carried about 10m passengers to 104 destinations, 76 of them international.
Today, its fleet has increased to 233 aircraft, overall passenger numbers have more than quadrupled, and the 
number of international destinations on its departure boards has reached 197. Turkish Airlines now flies to more 
countries than any other carrier - 104 at last count.
At the 2013 Skytrax World Airline Awards, passengers also voted it the best airline in Europe for the third 
consecutive year.
With much of Europe within three hours by air from Istanbul, Turkish Airlines has traditionally been wedded to the 
continent. Yet that, too, is changing.
Over the past decade, the share of European passengers on its international flights has dropped from 70 per cent 
to below 60 per cent. The share of African and Middle East passengers, meanwhile, has risen from 4 to 8 per cent, 
and from 11 to 16 per cent, respectively.
The foray into new markets has paid off. With a 2012 operating margin of 7 per cent, Turkish Airlines has become 
Europe's third most profitable carrier, behind Ryanair and easyJet, according to the Capa Centre for Aviation, a 
think-tank.
National carrier experiences rapid expansion Turkey
Turkish Airlines expects revenues of $9.8bn this year, a 17 per cent increase on 2012.
However, with a host of new destinations on the way, including long-haul flights to the US and Asia that will drive up 
competition with Gulf carriers, Turkish Airlines is rapidly outgrowing its Istanbul base. For an airline that expects to 
carry 120m passengers by 2023, Ataturk International airport, which last year handled 45m travellers, simply will not 
do.
That is where the Turkish government, keen to boost Istanbul's status as an international hub, is lending a hand.
Istanbul's third international airport, which officials expected to reach a capacity of 90m passengers by 2018, is in 
the pipeline. According to Binali Yildirim, Turkey's transportation minister, construction is due to begin in the next 
few months.
Where governments might sometimes get in the way of a carrier's growth ambitions, Turkey's administration, which 
owns 49 per cent of Turkish Airlines shares, is doing its best to stoke them.
Take Africa. Here, Turkey's economic and diplomatic expansion has been in step with that of its national carrier. In 
2009, Turkey had 12 embassies across the continent. Today, that number is 35.
The nation's exports to Africa, which were roughly $2bn in 2003, reached $13bn last year and Turkish Airlines' 
growth has been similarly rapid. From four destinations in 2003, the carrier has expanded to 34 today, including 15 
last year, says Ali Genc, a company representative.
In March 2012, following on the heels of Turkish aid organisations, the airline became the first European carrier to 
launch direct flights to Mogadishu in Somalia. Ten further African destinations are in the works.
"It's been something of a rule of thumb," says Serhat Guvenc, an associate professor at Istanbul's Kadir Has 
University, "that wherever there are Turkish schools, Turkish investments and interests, Turkish Airlines should fly 
to that destination."
(The opposite also appears to be true. While Turkish Airlines flies to three destinations in Azerbaijan, two in 
Georgia, and six more in Iran, in the case of Armenia, with which Turkey is yet to restore normal diplomatic 
relations, it has none.)
Temel Kotil, Turkish Airlines chief executive, is the first to acknowledge the overlap.
"[Our] strategies and operations are strongly correlated with Turkey's foreign and trade policy. We are working in 
great harmony with our government to realise our growth strategy," he says.
With a few exceptions, Turkish businesses have -followed where their national airline has led.
"Turkish Airlines has opened the doors of new markets to business people," says Rizanur Meral, president of the 
Turkish Confederation of Businessmen and Industrialists.
Without Istanbul's backing, Turkish Airlines would probably have had to chart a more moderate course, says 
Jonathan Wober, senior analyst at Capa, the think-tank.
"It's only a government that would initiate that kind of aggressive, potentially high-risk expansion . . . because a 
government may choose to take lower returns on its investment . . . if it is generating economic benefits elsewhere 
for the nation."
Kadir Has university's Prof Guvenc adds: "Most of these flights to these unorthodox destinations have become 
profitable."
The "if you build it, they will come" approach, he says, "seems to have worked".

The ISEQ made steadier gains in afternoon trading today after the Government announced it will not seek a

The Index rose 21.11 points to 4,490.80.
Ireland will exit the bailout next month without a precautionary credit line, the Government announced today. The 
European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund signed off on the last part of the 
85 billion euro aid programme last week, paving the way for Ireland to complete it by the end of the year. "This is 
the right decision for Ireland," Taoiseach Enda Kenny said this morning.
Data showing the euro zone economy slowed sharply in the third quarter curbed a rally in European shares after 
dovish comments from next Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen spurred early buying. Euro zone GDP figures 
showed the single currency bloc grew just 0.1 percent in the third quarter, slower than expected, curbing appetite 
for stocks in the region. Ryanair stocks fell 7c to E5.63 after it announced that it is to create more than 300 jobs in 
Ireland next year and will open up nine new routes from Dublin. The new routes from next April will serve Almeria, 
Spain; Bari, Italy; Basel, Switzerland; Bucharest, Romania; Chania, Crete; Comiso, Sicily; Marrakesh, Morocco; 
Prague, Czech Republic; and Lisbon, Portugal. The new jobs will include roles for pilots, cabin crew, customer 
service specialists and software developers, who will assist in "significant improvements to the Ryanair.com website 
and to our industry-leading customer service", RTE reported Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary as having said. Ryanair 
also said it expects to create a large number of indirect jobs at Dublin, Knock and Shannon airports to 
accommodate the extra 700,000 passengers expected next year.

Body
(RTTNews) - Irish airline Ryanair Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) Thursday said it will open 9 new routes from Dublin, 
beginning April 2014, along with increasing frequencies on 8 existing routes. This is intended to deliver an 
additional 700,000 passengers per annum, and support 700 new on-site jobs at Dublin Airport. ACI research 
confirms up to 1,000 'on-site' jobs are sustained at international airports for every 1 million passengers, the 
company added.
Additionally, the airline said it will create over 300 new direct jobs in Ireland for pilots, cabin crew, customer service 
specialists and software developers in 2014, as the company is to roll out an extensive programme of customer 
service and website improvements. This is along with the 1,000 indirect jobs that will be created at Dublin, Knock 
and Shannon airports to cater for the 1 million passenger growth which Ryanair will deliver from April 2014 following 
the scrapping of the 3 euro travel tax. Ryanair said its fares on these new Europe routes start from 29.99 euro.
"A critical component of this growth will be 100 extra weekly flights into Dublin from Britain, which will reverse the 
recent tourism declines in UK visitors coming to Ireland." Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said.

Prestwick & Kaunas from April 2014.
Body
This growth is part of the 1m extra passengers p.a. that Ryanair will deliver at the main Irish airports in a direct 
response to the Irish Government's decision to scrap the 3 travel tax from April 2014. Ryanair's expansion at Knock 
from April 2014 will deliver: 3 new routes to Eindhoven, Glasgow Prestwick & Kaunas (16 routes in total); increased 
frequency on the Knock to London routes (16 to 18 flights pw); 80,000 new Ryanair passengers p.a. (580,000 in 
total); 80 new on-site jobs; and Knock traffic will grow from 670,000 to over 750,000 p.a. Following successful 
negotiations with Knock and Shannon, Ryanair is finalising its discussions with the other main Irish airports Cork, 
Dublin and Kerry to finalise its growth plans for summer 2014 and hopes to announce more route and frequency 
growth from Ireland in the coming weeks. In Knock, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said: "Ryanair is pleased to 
announce 3 new routes and increased frequencies on its London route from Knock from April 2014, which will 
deliver 80,000 new passengers p.a. and support up to 80 new on-site jobs at Knock. This growth is in direct 
response to the Government's very welcome decision to scrap the 3 air travel tax from April 2014. "The scrapping of 
the travel tax will help restore Ireland's competitiveness and attractiveness to overseas visitors from the UK and 
Continental Europe in particular. 
Having met with all five of the main Irish airports, and announced new growth for 2014 at Shannon and Knock, we 
hope to announce further new route and traffic growth plans over the coming weeks."

Byline: Jeremy Grant in Singapore
Highlight: News analysis
Overcapacity hits sector amid clogged airports and rising competition, says Jeremy Grant
Body
"The People of India deserve to fly. Everyone should be able to fly," Tony Fernandes, owner of AirAsia, tweeted 
recently.
His comment was a call to arms typical of the Malaysian entrepreneur's relentless drive to expand his low-cost 
carrier across the region - most recently to India .
The ambitions of Mr Fernandes are another sign of how low-cost carriers (LCCs) have been growing aggressively 
in Asia as a rising middle class starts to afford air travel for the first time.
Carriers such as AirAsia - the leading regional LCC with 140 routes and 76 destinations - have steadily eaten away 
at the market share of established carriers such as Singapore Airlines and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific.
In the decade since they emerged as a force in southeast Asia, an area with a combined population of 600m, LCCs 
now account for more than half the seats available in the region, according to the Centre for Aviation, an Australia-
based research company.
Crowds fill the sky for Asia's budget airlines TRAVEL & LEISURE
By contrast the likes of easyJet and Ryanair account for 40 per cent of that market in the EU. And low-cost 
operators have existed in Europe for at least twice as long as their peers in Asia.
Yet as impressive as the growth of companies such as AirAsia has been, the low-cost sector is starting to feel the 
strain of overcapacity as overambitious orders for aircraft collide with clogged airports and intensifying competition 
among no-frills operators, analysts warn.
Indonesia, with a population of 250m, is on paper one of the world's most promising aviation markets.
Yet its leading no-frills airline, Lion Air, has about 550 aircraft on order from Boeing, Airbus and ATR - a number 
that has raised questions about how the airline plans to deploy them profitably. The most recent order came in 
March, when it agreed to buy 234 single-aisle jets from Airbus for $24bn.
The country's main airport in Jakarta was built to handle 22m passengers but with international passenger traffic 
growing at an annual compound rate of 11.5 per cent over the past five years, it actually handled more than 50m 
people in 2012, according to CLSA, a Hong Kong-based broker.
"There's huge potential for LCC growth but there's too much capacity and some of the growth in some cases has 
been too fast," says Brendan Sobie, an analyst at the Centre for Aviation in Singapore.
"A lot of aircraft are coming in at the same time and airlines are launching as well. The outlook is pretty good but 
competition is intense right now."
He says that southeast Asia - which also includes Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines - is the only region in the 
world where there are more aircraft on order than planes in service.
Such pressures mirror the pain felt in Europe by Ryanair and easyJet, Europe's two largest LCCs, which face a 
growing challenge from a group of budget airlines including Norwegian Air Shuttle and Budapest-based Wizz Air.
Industry analysts estimate there are 45 LCCs operating in Asia, some of them - such as Vietjet, a Vietnamese 
carrier - very recent entrants.
Established airlines have also entered the fray and account for about a third of the overall LCC number. Last year 
Singapore Airlines launched Scoot, a low-cost carrier that competes with AirAsia X, a long-haul, low-cost affiliate of 
AirAsia.
While the smaller carriers may be more vulnerable than more established operators, even the latter face 
challenges.
Shares in AirAsia - founded by Mr Fernandes in 2001 with just two aircraft - have fallen almost 9 per cent in US 
dollar terms this year amid investor concerns over increasing competition from Lion Air. Tiger Airways has suffered 
more: its shares are off 25 per cent.
Established carriers Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific have done relatively better. Singapore Airlines' shares 
are off 6.3 per cent in the period, while those of Cathay have risen more than 7 per cent.
This was borne out yesterday when Singapore Airlines posted a 78 per cent year-on-year jump in second-quarter 
net profit, buoyed by a 6.3 per cent rise in its passenger numbers to 4.81m during the three months to October.
Indar Dhaliwal, analyst at CLSA, adds that AirAsia is being tested in its home market as Malaysia Airlines has 
added capacity.
In the Philippines, where AirAsia started flights last year, the airline recently abandoned Clark airport, an hour's 
drive outside metro Manila, consolidating operations at Manila's main airport with Zest, a local LCC with which 
AirAsia did a share swap this year.
Crowds fill the sky for Asia's budget airlines TRAVEL & LEISURE
That should help it better compete with Cebu Pacific, the country's dominant airline. "There's been a lot of 
consolidation in the Philippines," Mr Dhaliwal says.
Tiger Airways, in which Singapore Airlines has a 32.7 per cent stake, is "struggling with overcapacity" at its main 
hub of Singapore, according to Raymond Yap, analyst at CIMB. The airline's Singapore unit made its first loss in six 
quarters in the second quarter, of S$18m ($14.4m).
"Tiger Airways will struggle to make headway in the Philippines and Indonesia as a late entrant and its Australian 
operations are beset by yield pressures," Mr Yap added.
In coming months Thailand will see three new LCCs enter the market: one each from Lion Air, Vietjet and AirAsia X.
And in Hong Kong, Australia's Qantas Airways, with China Eastern Airlines, is waiting to see whether the Hong 
Kong government will grant a licence for Jetstar Hong Kong, which would be the territory's only low-cost airline.
Mr Sobie says some consolidation is possible. "That would be a healthy outcome, because capacity and profitability 
would become more rational".

O'Leary scrambles to correct Ryanair wobble
O'Leary scrambles to correct Ryanair wobble

Body
It's never a good sign when a competitor is eager to talk about your business. It invariably means your rival has 
spotted a weakness and wants everyone else to see it as well. Inviting the comparison would otherwise be too 
risky, which is why chief executives tend to deflect questions about other companies. Nobody wants a broken 
window in their own glass house.
So when Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller cast a stone in Ryanair's direction on RTE's Morning Ireland 
last Tuesday, he must have felt pretty sure of hitting his mark. After all, the day before the low-cost airline had just 
delivered its second profit warning in as many months, sending shares plunging by 13 per cent as investors 
digested the news that its earnings would shrink for the first time in five years.
''For the first time someone has explored the dark side of the elasticity curve,'' said Mueller, responding to a 
question about Ryanair's pursuit of market share through relentless price cuts. ''They have cut prices by 20 per 
cent, but only gained 5 or 6 per cent in volume. That's a new phenomenon.''
For as long as anyone can remember, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has conquered all before him. His airline's 
business model has transformed the industry by providing cheap short-haul travel based on minimal service and 
disaggregated pricing.
He has opened up routes to destinations where no national carrier ever dreamed of going and forced full-service 
airlines to adjust their offerings just to stay in the game.
But O'Leary is also testing the lower bounds of pricing in his efforts to keep up the pressure. The airline is now 
expecting full-year profits of between EUR 500 million and EUR 520 million, well below its previous guidance of 
EUR 570 million for the year to the end of March. The reason: fares will drop by 10 per cent by the fourth quarter, 
pushing down customer yields.
O'Leary scrambles to correct Ryanair wobble
Ryanair hadn't issued a profit warning in a decade. For ten years O'Leary had under-promised and over-delivered. 
Now he was telling investors that ''it's one of those years'' where the company had to take a financial hit to maintain 
its competitive advantage for the sake of future profitability.
''You go back to the fundamentals, the Ryanair model,'' he told analysts on a conference call last Tuesday morning. 
''We take whatever price we get as long as we fill our planes to 82 per cent, 83 per cent on a year-round basis. And 
if this is one of those five or six years where prices fall, lets capitalise on it and be out there with aggressive pricing, 
driving up traffic and putting pressure on the competition.''
Stockbrokers have largely fallen in line with this reasoning. Goodbody cautioned clients about short-term weakness 
in the shares, but said the long-term fundamentals of the company remained positive -- especially going into 2015.
Investec noted that traffic would ''pause'' for the next 12 months, but that O'Leary's commitment to beating everyone 
else on price was ''bad news for competing airlines across Europe''. Davy cut its 12 month price target for Ryanair 
from EUR 8 to EUR 7 -- it was at EUR 5.68 on Friday -- while noting that the airline was laying down the building 
blocks for future growth and compensating for lower yields with customary cost discipline.
Yet what if Mueller is right? If Ryanair has saturated the European short-haul market and driven both cost and price 
down to their productive limits, O'Leary is facing a novel kind of challenge. Ryanair's unique service proposition has 
always been about going lower than the competition. This disruptive business model depended on a few key 
factors: the legacy costs of other airlines, increased incomes in the EU, opening new routes, shrewd fleet 
management and charging for everything.
But like every successful business model, Ryanair's approach has spawned imitators. Not only have start-up 
airlines sought to mimic what the market leader does, but old-school carriers such as Aer Lingus have chosen some 
items from the Ryanair menu, as well. O'Leary now faces the challenge of doubling-down on that model in the 
hopes that the competition just can't stay in the game if Ryanair is setting the rules.
Easyjet is snapping at Ryanair's heels. The airline had strong October passenger statistics, showing a 5.4 per cent 
increase in numbers carried with a load factor of 89.4 per cent. It is expected to carry 61 million passengers this 
year -- three quarters of Ryanair's haul -- and increase that figure by about 5 per cent next year. Tiny airline 
Norwegian is booming, too, with traffic up 38 per cent and passenger numbers up 19 per cent. And the airline has 
something Ryanair doesn't: long-haul.
O'Leary is correct to point out that Ryanair's challengers still charge more, but what happens when rivals ape your 
overall approach, but deliver a better service for a modestly higher price? Where customers seek the best value 
rather than just the best price, competitive advantage will erode.
This could explain Ryanair's grudging concessions on customer service. In an unprecedented move, O'Leary has 
begun to respond to customer complaints. The airline will introduce allocated seating starting in February, meaning 
families and groups can be sure of sitting together instead of wrestling for seats after boarding.
O'Leary also said Ryanair would allow small second carry-on bags -- such as handbags or duty-free shopping bags 
-- free of charge. Booking and check-in will be less hostile, as well, with a new 24 hour grace period to correct 
errors and lower penalties for losing a boarding card.
These changes to core components of Ryanair's offering indicate O'Leary senses a more fundamental challenge to 
his business model than a soft pricing environment.
Indeed, it hasn't been a great year for the ebullient, ground-breaking chief executive. In August the British 
Competition Commission ordered Ryanair to cut its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus to just 5 per cent. Ryanair is 
appealing the decision.
But the stake in Aer Lingus (Ryanair is the biggest shareholder, closely followed by the Irish government with 25 per 
cent) has been a bit of a disaster for O'Leary, who has twice had takeover attempts rebuffed by the EU. The 
O'Leary scrambles to correct Ryanair wobble
investment cost more than EUR 400 million. If the bulk has to be sold down to just 5 per cent, losses could exceed 
EUR 250 million.
A chastened O'Leary has made some conciliatory gestures in the direction of the Irish government recently, 
expanding in Shannon and Knock in response to the abolition of a Euro 3 per seat tax in Budget 2014. Transport 
minister Leo Varadkar is still sticking to his line that there will be no sale of the government's stake until the price is 
right.
In the meantime Ryanair is continuing its Euro 1 billion share buyback programme as a way to keep investors sweet 
while the airline navigates through a more challenging competitive landscape. The share price has recovered 
somewhat from its plunge last week as O'Leary announced another EUR 150 million tranche, but is still far off its 
October highs of nearly EUR 6.50.
Ongoing fleet renewal and new deals in Stansted and Warsaw are bids to cement the airline's place at the top of 
the heap in Europe. But for the first time, that position is no longer a foregone conclusion after this month's wobble.
.........................
**Bulletin**
Ryanair's unprecedented second profit warning in two months has raised questions about the sustainability of its 
business model of cutting costs and prices to build market share
Analysts believe the airline's troubles are temporary and that chief executive Michael O'Leary is laying a solid 
foundation for further growth in 2015, but major customer service concessions by the infamously surly airline 
suggest a more fundamental change is afoot
This year has been especially turbulent for O'Leary, with regulatory defeats signalling a failure of his Aer Lingus 
stakebuilding, although Ryanair's strong balance sheet means there is plenty of cash to keep investors happy.

Highlight: Ryanair's polarising public face may now move off the radar, say Andrew Parker and Jamie Smyth
Body
Michael. Big bollocks. Loudmouth. You'll find me not very sensitive." That is how Michael O'Leary replied to a 
question from the Financial Times two years ago about how he preferred to be addressed. And this is what the chief 
executive of Ryanair - arguably Europe's most reviled airline - said back then about the case for being nicer to its 
customers: "Couldn't possibly be nicer . . . Our service consists of the lowest fare, an on-time flight on a brand new 
aircraft. Anything over that: go away," he declared, amid some trademark expletives.
This week, Mr O'Leary had a rather different message as he outlined the biggest improvements to customer service 
in the Irish low-cost carrier's 29-year history. "I want to be loved by my customers - I want my customers to love me 
the way I love them," he said.
His sarcasm could not disguise what is a significant U-turn by one of the most powerful people in global aviation. 
Ryanair had just issued two profit warnings in as many months, and the airline is belatedly realising that it must 
treat its customers better if it is to succeed with an ambitious growth strategy.
This comes after Ryanair shareholders in September expressed concern about the company's macho culture - 
personified by 52-year-old Mr O'Leary. That month, Muhammad Taufiq Sattar, a surgeon whose family died in a

fire, was charged EUR188 by the airline to change his flight after the tragedy. Ryanair eventually apologised and 
refunded the money, but only after a public relations disaster .
The man who has transformed Ryanair into Europe's largest low-cost, short-haul carrier, flying 79.3m passengers in 
2012-13, likes to portray himself as a man of the people, championing air travel for the masses. But he comes from 
a comfortable background. The son of an entrepreneur, he grew up on a farm near the town of Mullingar, about 50 
miles northwest of Dublin. There, thanks to his father, Ted, he developed a passion for horseracing. He still lives in 
this area with his wife and four children.
Mr O'Leary was educated at Clongowes Wood College, an elite all-boys Jesuit boarding school. He read business 
studies at Trinity College Dublin and then trained as an accountant with KPMG.
Tony Ryan, the Irish businessman who founded Ryanair, hired him as a personal assistant in the late 1980s, when 
the nascent business was losing money. He was despatched to Dallas to visit Herb Kelleher's Southwest Airlines, 
the company that pioneered the low-cost carrier business model.
That trip gave Mr O'Leary a blueprint for Ryanair that he has implemented with zeal since becoming chief executive 
in 1994. A low-cost ethos is embraced at every level, including his attire, which usually consists of an open-necked 
shirt, jeans and trainers. He talks - and walks - very fast. "He is the most energetic man I've ever worked with. He 
goes all day and never stops," says a former colleague.
He may be exhausting to work with but he has delivered. Ryanair has the leanest cost structure in European 
aviation, enabling it to report industry-leading margins and become the fifth-largest airline in the world by market 
capitalisation. His 3.6 per cent stake in the company, worth about EUR290m, makes him one of Ireland's richest 
businessmen.
Dublin-born Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, parent of British Airways, says Mr O'Leary "has transformed the 
airline industry, particularly in Europe, and he deserves credit and admiration". And while many Irish people 
complain bitterly about their experiences flying with Ryanair, most remember the huge cost of air travel before the 
airline emerged to compete with Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier.
"He is very much a local hero - people either love him or hate him but most Irish people have a grudging admiration 
of O'Leary," says Siobhan Creaton, author of Ryanair: How A Small Irish Airline Conquered Europe.
The haters may take their cue from how Mr O'Leary has displayed an insatiable appetite for publicity stunts and 
outrageous statements - many of them crude. But as notable as the jokes is the ruthless efficiency with which he 
and his lieutenants run the company.
He has repeatedly rejected the case for unions engaging in collective bargaining. He has thrived on battles - notably 
with Irish politicians and the European Commission, which has twice blocked efforts to buy Aer Lingus. One Ryanair 
executive said in 2011 that Mr O'Leary had "made a virtue out of antagonising and provoking people - although he 
is quite tolerant, actually, at a personal level".
So is Mr O'Leary really going to be nicer to his customers? The proposed customer service improvements are 
substantive - and Ryanair's chief executive seems committed to them, not least because the airline is buying 175 
Boeing aircraft and seeking to add 30m customers over the next five years. Acknowledging he is an "irritant" to 
customers in some markets, he plans to stop being the public face of the airline.
But Mr O'Leary is unlikely to change all his spots. On Wednesday he told the BBC he had the right attitude, in spite 
of previously confessing to "personality deformities". He defended Ryanair's use of pictures of female cabin crew in 
bikinis - notably in its calendar that raises money for charity.
Marriage and children do, however, appear to have mellowed Mr O'Leary. He came to both relatively late; he 
married Anita Farrell, a banker, in 2003, and all their children are under the age of eight. His lieutenants like to joke 
The mouthy airline chief who annoyed too many passengers Person in the news: Michael O'Leary
that the only way he will leave Ryanair is in a coffin, but his youngest child - who is just two - has provided his best 
gag yet on when he might quit.
"They'll be going to boarding school in 10 years' time, which seems to me about the right time to retire and spend 
more time at home," he says.

Body
The shoe is not just on the other foot, it is tied tightly with a double knot. Here comes Michael O'Leary, chief 
executive of Ryanair. The European budget airline was once the upstart of the industry, striking fear into rivals with 
low headline fares and cunning ways to extract more money from passengers. In 2013 it has warned twice on 
profits , most recently this week. The European economy is weak and competition is hurting, forcing it to soften its 
edge in an effort to lure in passengers. Its shares are down 23 per cent since the start of July.
Then there's Willie Walsh, his opposite number at International Airlines Group, full of confidence. These days the 
owner of Iberia and British Airways is looking like anything but an ailing flag carrier. Third-quarter numbers on 
Friday beat estimates, pushing the shares up. They have risen 36 per cent since the start of July (take that, Mr 
O'Leary). The turnround at Iberia is on track. Capacity has been taken out and operating costs in the third quarter 
were 17 per cent below the same period last year. Vueling, the low-cost Spanish airline that IAG took full control of 
in April, is also going nicely. The group expects an operating profit of EUR740m this year, a big improvement on the 
EUR23m loss reported last year or the EUR485m profit the year before.
So, to borrow the weary clichés about airline shares, IAG is soaring away while Ryanair has hit turbulence. But 
hang on a minute: What ails Ryanair could yet ail IAG. More than half of IAG's passengers (although a much 
smaller portion of revenues) are in the European short-haul market. True, Ryanair has a very different short-haul 
business model to BA and Iberia. But by taking control of Vueling, IAG is now a more direct competitor to the Irish 
airline.

And Mr Walsh has other challenges to deal with. Iberia is still nailing down details of its cost cuts with the unions. 
There could be more news on that at a capital markets day next week. BA is growing, with 6 per cent new capacity 
coming in the fourth quarter. And the group is still fine-tuning its organisational structure, three years after it was 
created. There was more reshuffling at board level this week.
Despite all that, IAG has a following wind and recent price movements have pushed its market capitalisation above 
that of Ryanair. Still, assuming that Mr Walsh can keep the good news coming is as dangerous as assuming that Mr 
O'Leary cannot fight back.

Highlight: Spanish carrier set to shed 3,100 jobs
Body
International Airlines Group yesterday reported progress with the restructuring of Iberia, its troubled Spanish 
subsidiary, but warned that further cost-saving measures must be agreed with trade unions.
In what is a strong quarter for many airlines because it coincides with the summer holiday period, Iberia made an 
operating profit of EUR74m in the three months to September 30, compared with EUR1m during the same period 
last year.
Iberia's poor performance pushed IAG to a pre-tax loss of EUR997m last year, and the Spanish flag carrier is now 
partway through a contentious restructuring that involves 3,100 job losses .
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said Iberia was on track to shed 2,700 jobs this year, with additional 
redundancies in 2014 and 2015, but stressed there would also need to be further productivity improvements at the 
airline.
"Although we are pleased with the performance of Iberia . . . there is a hell of a lot of work still to do," he added.
IAG, also parent of British Airways, reported revenues of EUR5.4bn for the third quarter of 2013, up 6.9 per cent 
compared with the same period last year. Pre-tax profits came to EUR609m, up from EUR237m one year ago.
IAG warns of further cost-cutting for Iberia TRAVEL & LEISURE
IAG's shares finished 8 per cent higher yesterday, at a record high of 376.9p.
British Airways made an operating profit of EUR477m in the third quarter, but the star performer was Vueling. The 
Barcelona-based low-cost carrier, that IAG bought in April, recorded an operating profit of EUR139m in the third 
quarter, and a margin of 25 per cent.
IAG expects to see an operating profit before exceptional items of EUR740m for 2013. This is the first time the 
group has given earnings guidance since February, when it said operating profit before one-off items in 2013 should 
exceed EUR485m.
IAG's bullish guidance contrasts with Ryanair, which has issued two profit warnings in the past two months, blaming 
its reduced earnings forecasts on the effects of increased competition and weak European economies in the fourth 
quarter of this year.
But Mr Walsh said some European short-haul markets may be struggling precisely because Ryanair has cut fares 
on many of its routes to EUR15.
"Some of this is possibly caused by Ryanair - they set the prices in a lot of markets and if they are setting the price 
at EUR14.99 then airlines competing in that same segment as Ryanair will find it difficult . . . the fourth quarter is 
always challenging but I am not seeing anything unusual about this year."
Some analysts have said Ryanair has cut fares to try to safeguard its market share in the face of a growing 
challenge from competitors including Norwegian Air Shuttle, Vueling and Budapest-based Wizz Air.

Rail competition [Re: It's time to fight the claim that consumer choice doesn't improve public services, Wednesday] 
Paul Ormerod's support of train operating companies is laughable. There is almost no true competition: I can wait 
all day on Greenwich platform, and only Southeastern trains will go by. There is no choice: train operating 
companies are state-subsidised monopolies, not businesses subject to market forces. Further, to claim that 
privatisation was the catalyst for a rise in rail journeys belies the huge increase in government investment and 
considerable demographic changes that have taken place over the period.
Simon Thorley Ryanair grounded [Re: As it cuts its profits forecast, has the success of Ryanair's "no frills" business 
model peaked?, Tuesday] It is clear that Ryanair has temporarily lost its lustre, driving customers towards alternate 
carriers with its onerous website. But cost discipline continues - passenger costs are still falling and its lower fuel 
hedged position for 2015 will deliver significant reductions. And it is acting on perceived customer relations 
problems by introducing allocated seating and a new website. Despite recent turbulence, Ryanair remains one of 
the best-run companies around.

Ryanair has vowed to improve its service and Airbus has called for wider economy seats to give passengers a 
better night's sleep.
Is flying about to become more pleasant? In your dreams.
Ryanair's service promise came after shareholders criticised the abrasive style of Michael O'Leary, its chief 
executive. The airline, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, this week cut its profit forecast for the second time in two 
months.
Ryanair says it will improve its website, relax its aggressive approach to carry-on luggage and give customers 24 
hours to correct mistakes made when booking online.
I have long been ambivalent about Mr O'Leary. Other low-cost airlines are more polite and some, such as 
Southwest Airlines of the US, with its rapping cabin crew , and South Africa's Kulula, with its dark onboard humour , 
manage to be funny. ("Welcome to Johannesburg," went a Kulula announcement I once heard. "If you are visiting, 
we hope you enjoy your stay. If you are returning home, we hope your car is where you left it.")
On the other hand, Mr O'Leary's approach struck me as being an instance of truth in advertising. Flying is awful, he 
seemed to say. Rather than pretending we love you, we offer ridiculously low prices.
Ryanair , Airbus and nightmare flights
Flying is awful. Why? Mostly because you have so little room. Apart from rush-hour train commutes, which 
generally don't last that long, there is nowhere else those of us lucky enough to live above the poverty line have to 
sit in such proximity to strangers.
Low-cost flights, at least, generally take place during the day. They are bad enough, but overnight flights are 
dreadful. Some people seem to be able to drop off. For those of us who struggle to sleep even in our own beds, a 
night in the air is purgatory.
Airbus says a slightly wider seat would improve our in-flight sleep. It cited research by the London Sleep Centre, 
which simulated flying conditions, including background sounds, in-flight entertainment and catering, while 
measuring the brainwaves, eye, abdominal, chest and leg movements of six volunteers.
It found that the sleep quality of those in 18-inch seats was 53 per cent better than those in 17in seats. So is Airbus 
going to widen its seats to 18in? It doesn't need to. Its long-haul economy seats are already 18in. Why the research 
and the press release? Because "other manufacturers" - who can they mean? - "are eroding passenger comfort 
standards by going back to narrower seat widths".
So this is a bit of intercompany needle. I recently flew on an Airbus A380 for the first time and admired the ingenuity 
that produced the world's biggest aircraft. But I slept fitfully. It is not seat width that bothers me; it is the lack of leg 
room. Passengers who slam their seats into the fully-reclined position make it worse.
Most airlines aren't about to widen the gaps between seats. To understand why, look at the industry's projected 
2013 profit figures. According to the International Air Transport Association , the world's airlines are expected to 
make an $11.7bn profit on revenues of $708bn. That is a margin of 1.7 per cent.
Many airlines struggle to survive. Alitalia is battling to stave off bankruptcy . The European Commission recently 
allowed the monopoly-creating takeover of Olympic Air by Aegean Airlines, a fellow Greek carrier, because Olympic 
would otherwise have gone out of business.
Ryanair faces increasing competition from low-cost rivals and is cutting fares further. Mr O'Leary says: "If a couple 
of competitors get blown up as part of that process - well and good."
He is being a little less nasty to the customers, who have more choice, not to the competition. I don't think we will 
see more legroom in his aircraft. I have talked only about economy. As I work for a lean, cost-conscious company, I 
haven't flown business class for 15 years.
I walk past the business class lot as they settle into their soon-to-unfolded beds. They look pleased with 
themselves. But really: those beds look as narrow as ironing boards and there is a stranger sleeping across a small 
partition. You get more privacy in a youth hostel. Business class is not comfortable either. It just feels that way 
compared with the wretches at the back.

EASYJET posted a 5.4 per cent rise in traffic for the last month, prompting relieved investors to send its shares up 
0.9 per cent yesterday.
The firm, whose rival Ryanair issued a profit warning on Monday, said it carried 5.5m passengers in October, 
adding customers in spite of air traffic control strikes in France and Italy.
In the year to October, EasyJet took 61m passengers, four per cent higher than last year.

A Belgian court has ruled itself "incompetent" to hear a case brought by six ex-employees of Ryanair who took the 
low-cost airline to court claiming some E20,000 each.
The Belgian, Spanish and Portuguese air hostesses and stewards allege that Ryanair has cheated them out of 
extra money they would have earned had they been employed under Belgian law instead of Irish employee 
protections.
In response, Ryanair this morning welcomed the outcome, saying the Charleroi Labour Court's decision is in line 
with a previous decision in 2007 when the Mons Appeal Court upheld Ryanair's position that any dispute regarding 
contracts of employment should be dealt with through the Irish Courts and mirrors other rulings in Germany, Italy 
and Spain.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: "Ryanair welcomes this ruling which upholds the EU regulations governing mobile 
transport workers and which mirrors similar rulings in Germany, Italy and Spain. Since Ryanair crew members 
spend their working day on Irish aircraft (which is Irish territory), are employed on Irish contracts and pay their taxes 
and social taxes in Ireland, there is no basis for any claim that they should be subject to Belgian employment law " 
The employment tribunal in Charleroi -- Ryanair's hub for European and north African flights to and from Brussels -- 
ruled itself "incompetent" in what is seen as a clear victory for the company. Belgian workers benefit from extras like 
a "13th month" bonus salary payment, and better holiday and other social benefits and protections than available 
under more liberal Irish employment law. The six argued that because they lived in Belgium, they took off from 
Charleroi and had trained there, this meant they should be granted the same privileges as other Belgian workers. 
Ryanair argued that the majority of the workers' employment took place in the air and outside Belgian legal 
jurisdiction, and therefore that the claims for back pay were unjustified. The court ruled that Belgium did not occupy 
a "preponderant" place in their working routine, and so declared itself incompetent to hear the case. Union

The ISEQ powered ahead today, buoyed by strong results from Smurfit Kappa and by a rise in equities across 
Europe.
The ISEQ was up 31.29 points to 4,428.39.
Shares in Smurfit Kappa climbed 20c to E18.20 after it posted a nine-month pre-tax profit of E231m, down 19pc 
from E286m a year earlier. Revenue was E5.9b, from E5.5b a year earlier, its latest interim management statement 
said. However, the third quarter of this year was better for the group with revenues up 10pc compared to a year ago 
at E2.016bn and pre-tax profits of E104m compared to E102 in the same quarter a year earlier. "The Group is 
pleased to report EBITDA of E303 million in the quarter. The Americas has been a strong contributor to the EBITDA 
performance in the third quarter," the company said.
Shares in Ryanair rose 10c to E5.68. A Belgian court has ruled itself "incompetent" to hear a case brought by six

The ISEQ powered ahead this morning, buoyed by strong results from Smurfit Kappa and by a rise in equities 
across Europe.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was up 58.87 points to 4,455.97.
Shares in Smurfit Kappa climbed 40c to E18.40 after it posted a nine-month pre-tax profit of E231m, down 19pc 
from E286m a year earlier. Revenue was E5.9b, from E5.5b a year earlier, its latest interim management statement 
said. However, the third quarter of this year was better for the group with revenues up 10pc compared to a year ago 
at E2.016bn and pre-tax profits of E104m compared to E102 in the same quarter a year earlier. "The Group is 
pleased to report EBITDA of E303 million in the quarter. The Americas has been a strong contributor to the EBITDA 
performance in the third quarter," the company said.
Shares in Ryanair rose 15c to E5.73. A Belgian court has ruled itself "incompetent" to hear a case brought by six 
ex-employees of Ryanair who took the low-cost airline to court claiming some E20,000 each. The Belgian, Spanish 
and Portuguese air hostesses and stewards allege that Ryanair has cheated them out of extra money they would

released by Markit Economics. At 53.2 in October, the seasonally adjusted final composite output index was 
unchanged from September.

food product turnover. The volume of retail sales dropped 0.6 percent month-on-month, reversing August's 0.5 
percent rise, Eurostat reported.
In the U.K., the house price index grew 6.9 percent on an annual basis in the three months to October, following a

may start tapering stimulus by the end of the year.
In the U.S., futures point to a higher open on Wall Street. The major U.S. averages ended largely unchanged 
overnight, as investors weighed better-than-expected data out of the service sector against the European 
Commission's sluggish autumn forecast for the EU economy.

EasyJet October Passengers, Load Factor Rise
EasyJet October Passengers, Load Factor Rise

(RTTNews) - UK-based low-cost airline easyJet Plc (ESYJY.PK, EZJ.L) Wednesday reported higher passengers 
and load factor for the month of October, even as it canceled more flights due to the strikes at French and Italian 
airports.
The number of passengers, which represents the number of earned seats flown, in October rose 5.4 percent to 5.53 
million from 5.25 million a year before.
Since easyJet is a no-refund airline, earned seats for the company include seats that are flown whether or not the 
passenger turns up. Once a flight has departed, a no-show customer is generally not entitled to change flights or 
seek a refund. Earned seats also include seats provided for promotional purposes and to staff for business travel.
Monthly load factor, which stands for the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available for 
passengers, rose 0.7 percentage points to 89.1 percent from 88.4 percent last year.
The airline canceled 179 flights during the recent month, against 27 last year, driven mainly by air traffic control 
strikes at French and Italian airports.
For the rolling 12 months ending October, passengers improved 4 percent and load factor advanced 0.8 percentage 
points.
In September, the airline carried 5.71 million passengers, up 4.8 percent from the previous year, while load factor 
improved 1.2 percentage points to 89.7 percent from 88.5 percent.
EasyJet last month lifted its outlook for full-year pre-tax profit, on strong demand in July and August. The firm said it 
expects full year profit before tax in the range of 470 million pounds to 480 million pounds, compared to the 
previous outlook of 450 million pounds to 480 million pounds.
In contrast, Irish peer Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) earlier this week cut its full year profit forecast, citing 
a fall in average prices.
EZJ.L is gaining 2 percent in early morning trading at 1,227 pence.

(RTTNews) - The majority of the European markets finished to the upside Wednesday, bouncing back from the 
weakness of the prior session. Investor sentiment received a boost from strong earnings reports from companies 
such as ING. Investors also combed through a number of economic reports, such as the weaker than expected 
European retail sales data, the surge in German factory orders and the rebound in British industrial production.
Investors will be watching for interest rate decisions from both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England 
tomorrow. Also on the horizon is the all important U.S. jobs report for October on Friday.
Euro money market turnover increased in the second quarter versus a year ago and interbank trading conditions 
are stabilizing, a latest survey by the European Central Bank showed on Wednesday.
The "Euro Money Market Survey 2013" highlighted the main developments in the euro money market in the second 
quarter of 2013, comparing them with those in the second quarter of 2012. Results are derived from a constant 
panel of 104 banks.
Total turnover in the euro money market grew 3 percent year-on-year to EUR 75 trillion in the second quarter. This 
was in contrast to an 18 percent plunge in the same period last year.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks increased by 0.61 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, added 0.25 percent.
The DAX of Germany climbed by 0.35 percent and the CAC 40 of France advanced by 0.79 percent. The FTSE 100 
of the U.K. fell by 0.08 percent, but the SMI of Switzerland gained by 0.92 percent.
In Frankfurt, Sky Deutschland increased by 1.25 percent. Berenberg downgraded the stock to ''Hold'' from ''Buy.''
Fraport gained 0.67 percent, after reporting an increase in profit.
Car parts maker Elringklinger, which announced quarterly results, advanced by 0.82 percent.
In Paris, Alstom climbed by 5.81 percent, after its quarterly report.
Lafarge finished up by 0.28 percent. The cement giant reported quarterly results.
In London, Associated British Foods increased by 2.76 percent. Citigroup raised its price target on the stock.
European Markets Climbed On Strong Corporate Earnings Results
EasyJet gained 0.91 percent. The low-cost airline reported traffic data for October. Peer Ryanair added 1.79 
percent after HSBC upgraded the stock to ''Overweight'' from ''Neutral.''
Experian sank by 6.04 percent. The company has agreed to acquire US-based Passport Health Communications 
Inc. for $850 million.
Old Mutual rose by 2.30 percent, after its third quarter revenues improved.
Mondi, which reported quarterly results, dropped by 4.12 percent.
ING climbed by 3.49 percent in Amsterdam. The financial firm reported about 85 percent fall in the third-quarter net 
profit, but underlying net profit improved 5.6 percent, driven by solid performance at both ING Bank and Insurance 
EurAsia.
Vestas Wind Systems surged by 14.91 percent in Copenhagen. The firm reported a narrower quarterly loss.
Eurozone retail sales declined slightly more than expected in September driven by the weakness in food and non-
food product turnover, data showed Wednesday. The volume of retail sales dropped 0.6 percent month-on-month, 
reversing August's 0.5 percent rise, Eurostat reported. Economists had forecast sales to fall 0.4 percent in 
September.
Eurozone's private sector business activity expanded at a slightly faster pace than previously estimated in October, 
detailed results of a survey by Markit Economics showed Wednesday. However, the rate of expansion remained 
weaker than that of September.
The composite output index, an indicator that measures performance of both manufacturing and service sectors, 
came in at 51.9, higher than the flash reading of 51.5. In September, the index stood at 52.2, a 27-month high.
Germany's private sector growth remained unchanged in October, according to final survey data released by Markit 
Economics. At 53.2 in October, the seasonally adjusted final composite output index which measures the combined 
output of the manufacturing and service sectors - was unchanged from September and comfortably above the 50.0 
no-change value, it said Wednesday. The flash reading for October was 52.6.
Germany's manufacturing orders recovered at a faster-than-expected pace in September, supported by a further 
strong rise in demand for capital goods, signaling continued improvement in the domestic economy at the start of 
the fourth quarter.
New business placed with German manufactures climbed a seasonally and calendar-adjusted 3.3 percent from 
August, when they decreased by 0.3 percent, data from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology showed 
Wednesday.
The growth rate far exceeded the 0.5 percent gain economists had forecast. In July, the manufacturing sector had 
recorded a 2 percent fall in demand.
French service sector business activity edged higher for a second consecutive month in October, albeit at a weaker 
pace, detailed results of a survey by Markit Economics showed Wednesday. The final services activity index scored 
50.9 in October. This was higher than the flash reading of 50.2, but was below September's score of 51.
British industrial production bounced back at a stronger-than-expected pace in September, after a decline in the 
previous month as manufacturing sector recovered, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showed 
Wednesday.
Total production increased 0.9 percent on a monthly basis in September, compared with the forecast for a 0.6 
percent gain. This followed a 1.1 percent drop in August.
European Markets Climbed On Strong Corporate Earnings Results
Overall shop prices continued to deflate in October, the British Retail Consortium reported Wednesday. BRC said 
its Shop Price reading for October was minus-0.5 percent, compared to minus-0.2 percent for September. It was 
the highest deflation record on record for October.
Residential property prices in the U.K. increased at a significantly faster pace in October, but to a slightly lesser 
extent than expected by economists, latest data showed Wednesday.
The house price index grew 6.9 percent on an annual basis in the three months to October, following a 6.2 percent 
gain in September, Lloyds Banking Group's housing division Halifax said. Economists were looking for a 7 percent

the month of September.
The Conference Board said its leading economic index rose by 0.7 percent in September following a matching

Roberto Scaramella
Chief executive, Meridiana
Italy urged to fall in line with EU rules on state aid, writes Guy Dinmore
Body
Alitalia is not the only lossmaking airline in Italy going through a painful restructuring and seeking new investors , as 
low-cost carriers continue to make inroads into the country's domestic and international markets.
Roberto Scaramella, chief executive of Meridiana, says he is on track this year to halve operating losses at Italy's 
second-largest airline, but complains that this turnround is being undermined by unfair subsidies given by local 
authorities and small airports to attract competitors such as Ryanair.
Mr Scaramella was appointed last January to rescue Meridiana after the Aga Khan Fund for Economic 
Development bought back the 49 per cent share of the airline that it did not already own following net losses last 
year of EUR190m.
Meridiana chief attacks 'unfair' airline subsidies
The fund, chaired by Shah Karim Al Hussaini Aga Khan, a UK businessman who founded the airline in Sardinia 50 
years ago, delisted Meridiana and increased its capital by EUR180m. About 1,000 jobs were cut and the fleet 
reduced from 37 to 29 aircraft.
Lossmaking routes were cancelled and new foreign destinations opened with a focus on high-yield charter 
activities, resulting in a 10 per cent increase in passengers this year to 4.2m. Mr Scaramella says Meridiana has 15 
per cent of Italy's domestic market and posted a "record summer".
Mr Scaramella told the Financial Times that he is delivering results and expects to break even next year, at which 
point Meridiana could look for a "potential partner".
Consolidation of the European airline industry is inevitable, he said, noting Alitalia's efforts to find a new investor , 
whether Air France-KLM, which owns 25 per cent, or another partner.
But he added: "It is impossible to turn around an airline without equal treatment of all players . . . there are issues at 
the system level we cannot fix."
According to Mr Scaramella, local authorities and small airports are offering what he considers unfair subsidies, 
sometimes amounting to EUR10 a passenger that total an estimated EUR300m, mostly benefiting low-cost carriers, 
including Ryanair and easyJet.
Latest data by Enac, Italy's civil aviation authority, confirm the rising penetration of low-cost carriers that in 2012 
held a combined domestic and international market share of 41.3 per cent, up 3.7 percentage points over 2011.
On Monday, Ryanair, releasing its results for the year to March 31 2013, claimed to be the largest airline in Italy. 
Enac's figures for 2012 put Alitalia in first place, with 25.3m passengers carried, followed by its Ireland-based rival 
with 22.8m.
"Italy has favoured low-cost carriers from abroad in an unfair way. There is nothing like this in the rest of the world," 
Mr Scaramella said, urging Italy to fall in line with EU regulations on state aid.
In July, the European Commission proposed a new set of rules that are likely to come into effect next year, setting 
out what is permissible in deals between airports and airlines. The aim is to ensure fair competition while allowing 
small town economies to develop and remain connected through their airports, although as Mr Scaramella points 
out the proliferation of airports in Italy means that across the north there is one for nearly every 40km.
Ryanair commented that its arrangements with all EU airports fully comply with competition rules. "The European 
Court in the Charleroi case in 2008 ruled that Ryanair's arms-length airport contracts do not constitute state aid," it 
said. "The commission didn't even appeal this court ruling and these draft guidelines reflect that ruling."
EasyJet, which also denies accepting direct or indirect state aid, said: "We welcome the much-needed clarification 
to existing rules and the commission's commitment to providing a level playing for airlines and airports."

Flemming Ornskov, Shire 's chief, told investors at a recent lunch that he wanted to rebrand the group's lead drug 
as a "psychiatric molecule" for treating myriad mental disorders. Trial results yesterday brought that possibility 
closer, writesBryce Elder .
Shire climbed to a record high, up 1.3 per cent to £28.58, after announcing its Vyvanse hyperactivity pill had been 
shown to curb binge eating. "With the successful data on hand, Vyvanse now has the potential to be the first 
pharmacological treatment indicated for binge eating," said Cowan & Co. It valued the market at around $250m a 
year with more possible given the potential overlap.
Financial stocks dragged the wider market lower after a profit warning from RSA Insurance. The FTSE 100 lost 
16.78 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 6,746.84.
RSA, down 6.3 per cent to 121p, blamed bad weather in Canada and Scandinavia as well as inadequate reserves 
against injury claims in Ireland. The one-off problems cut 2013 to about 15 per cent below consensus.
Aviva , whose Irish motor insurance business competes with RSA, slipped 1.1 per cent to 442p. Legal & General 
was down 2.2 per cent to 213.1p. Marks and Spencer climbed 4.5 per cent to 509p after it kept full-year guidance 
in spite of weaker than expected interim earnings.
Shire gains after trials of drug for binge eating
AB Foods fell 2.1 per cent to £22.08 after cautioning that annual earnings growth from its Primark chain would be 
erased by the continued decline of its sugar business.
EasyJet sank 2.2 per cent to £12.03 on fears of a price war with Ryanair , whose shares bounced 4.9 per cent to 
EUR5.58 following Monday's profit warning. Data centre operator TeleCity sunk 7 per cent to 688.5p a day after a 
trading update that confirmed 2013 earnings guidance, and in spite of directors' buying. Merrill Lynch argued it was 
overspending on capacity in an oversupplied market.
Among the small-caps, Blinkx surged to a record high, up 17.7 per cent to 197.8p, after the online video 
advertiser's interim results beat expectations.
Gulf Keystone Petroleum lost 1.2 per cent to 168.8p. Disposal delays "increase the possibility of a new equity 
issue alongside the planned move up to the Official List", said Peel Hunt, which cut the stock off its "buy" list.

Westhouse Securities has downgraded the FTSE 250-listed gold miner from a "neutral" to "sell" recommendation 
after strong third quarter results caused a share price rally. It has increased its target price on the stock from 115p 
to 170p, after raising its gold price forecast for the year.
HENRY BOOT Numis has initiated coverage of the housebuilder with a "buy" recommendation and a target price of 
217p, as it believes its significant exposure to residential land makes it an interesting investment. The target price 
could increase to 240p if UK house prices rise by 10 per cent.
RYANAIR Investec is maintaining its "buy" recommendation on the budget airline, whilst downgrading its target 
price from (EURO)8.00 to (EURO)6.20. "Despite steep earnings forecast declines, the group remains a highly 
competitive and cash-rich entity," said the broker.

Flemming Ornskov, Shire 's chief executive, told investors at a recent lunch that he wanted to rebrand the group's 
lead drug as a "psychiatric molecule" for treating myriad mental disorders. Trial results yesterday brought that 
possibility closer.
Shire climbed to a record high, up 1.3 per cent to £28.58, after announcing its Vyvanse hyperactivity pill had been 
shown to curb binge eating.
High demand to take part in the trial meant results arrived about three months early.
"With the successful data on hand, Vyvanse now has the potential to be the first pharmacological treatment 
indicated for binge eating," said Cowan & Co.
It valued the market at about $250m a year with more possible given the potential overlap among patients with adult 
hyperactivity and depression; key data on the latter is expected during the first half of 2014. Vyvanse will account 
for about 65 per cent of Shire's sales growth to 2018, house broker Morgan Stanley forecast.
But with hyperactivity treatments becoming increasingly genericised, a successful rebranding will be "essential to 
Shire's growth strategy", it said.
Financial stocks dragged the wider market lower after a profit warning from RSA Insurance.

Marks and Spencer climbed 4.5 per cent to 509p after it kept full-year guidance unchanged in spite of weaker than 
expected interim earnings.
While M&S would not comment in detail on current trading, management said the autumn-winter collection had 
made a good start and a hit to margins from early promotions should reverse.
AB Foods fell 2.1 per cent to £22.08 after cautioning that annual earnings growth from its Primark chain would be 
erased by the continued decline of its sugar business.
Chief executive George Weston once again rejected the idea of breaking up the group.
EasyJet sank 2.2 per cent to £12.03 on fears of a price war with Ryanair , whose shares bounced 4.9 per cent to 
EUR5.58 following Monday's profit warning.
HSBC advised switching from the former to the latter, saying Ryanair's moves to ape its rival were a "worrying [for 
EasyJet] form of flattery".
Data centre operator Telecity sank 7 per cent to 688.5p a day after a trading update that confirmed 2013 earnings 
guidance, and in spite of directors' buying.
Merrill Lynch argued that Telecity was overspending on capacity in an already oversupplied market.

Irish airline Aer Lingus yesterday reported a 4.4 per cent rise in operating profit to (EURO)94.9m (£79.9m) for the 
three months to the end of September, as a 0.9 per cent drop in passengers was offset by tight cost control. The 
firm said tough competition on fares in Europe had kept a lid on growth, echoing rival Ryanair's comments from 
earlier in the week. Aer Lingus maintained its full-year operating profit forecast at around (EURO)60m.

When one Ryanair shareholder made a stinging attack on Chief Executive Michael O'Leary at the airline's annual 
meeting for scaring off customers with his "bullying" and "macho" style, there was one thing he didn't mention.
That O'Leary's leaving was one of his biggest fears.
As Ryanair scrambles to reinvent itself and woo customers from higher-cost rivals to fill hundreds of new planes, 
there are growing concerns about the cost of what O'Leary recently described as his "personal character 
deformities".
But with his heir apparent about to leave - and as a series of profit warnings eat away at O'Leary's air of invincibility 
- a bigger worry is that Europe's largest airline has left itself over-dependent on a single personality. "On the main 
issues he has been hugely successful ... but there is some really bad stuff," said Alan Marlborough, a private 
shareholder with a sizeable portion of his savings in Ryanair, a month after his AGM outburst. "Is the company 
over-dependent on him? I think it is." Asked, however, if O'Leary's departure was one of the biggest concerns for 
Ryanair, he told Reuters: "I totally agree." O'Leary, an outspoken and hard-charging 52-year-old who used to run 
newsagent shops, has been in charge of Ryanair since 1994 and is described by executives who have worked with 
him as a workaholic with a forensic knowledge of every aspect of the company. A near-religious devotion to cost-
cutting has allowed him to transform a small loss-making regional airline into the biggest carrier by passenger 
numbers in Europe, and in turn transform the industry. But now budget airlines' customer care is under scrutiny, 
particularly at Ryanair. Critics say O'Leary's brusque personality and expletive-filled rants have helped to alienate 
swathes of potential customers, while his domination of decision-making has meant a number of strategic mistakes. 
The stress of no-frills flying and rigid enforcement of fines for baggage size has left some passengers sobbing at 
the airport gate, and the Irish firm was voted the worst of the 100 biggest brands serving the British market by 
Investors love/hate O'Leary relationship Ryanair AGM
readers of consumer magazine Which? Other shareholders chimed in at the AGM with anecdotes about family 
members refusing to fly Ryanair and verbal attacks they had suffered at dinner parties. O'Leary nodded sheepishly 
as he faced up to the concerns about the "abrupt" culture. "It's a committee of one in most instances," said one of 
Ryanair's 10 largest shareholders, who blames O'Leary for costly decisions like "screwing up" fuel hedging in 2009 
and a "disastrous" push into in-flight entertainment. But the shareholder, who requested anonymity, is resigned to 
taking the bad with the good and cannot see many worthy alternative leaders to take the place of the man who has 
overseen a tenfold rise in the share price in 15 years. "Replacing O'Leary is like replacing Alex Ferguson," he said, 
a comparison with the manager of Manchester United soccer team, who retired this year after nearly 27 trophy-filled 
years. "It will be extremely tough for anyone to replicate what he has achieved." O'Leary has said repeatedly he 
would leave when Ryanair ends its fast growth stage and enters comfortable middle age, but he said in an interview 
last week that would not be soon, with the deliveries of 175 new planes starting next year. The replacement of 
retiring deputy chief executive Michael Cawley with two senior executives in March will give signs of O'Leary's 
thinking on strategy and succession. Shareholders trust that with most of O'Leary's wealth - around 275 million 
euros - tied up in Ryanair shares, there will be no shocks. And some believe his cost-cutting dogma has been 
embedded so deeply in the company's DNA that when he does leave, the company's core strength will remain 
undiminished. "His personality isn't why the business does so well. It does so well because everything is about low 
cost," said Donal O'Neill, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. The latest questions about O'Leary's 
management have been raised after the company announced a series of major policy reversals weeks after their 
first profit warning in a decade - a tacit admission for many that O'Leary had taken cost-cutting and harsh penalties 
for passengers too far. This has allowed rivals like easyJet and Aer Lingus to build their sales pitches on being less 
uncomfortable than Ryanair, though O'Leary says this has not forced the airline to engage in a price war, blaming a 
general weakness across Europe instead. O'Leary has impressed airline industry analysts by the scale of the U-
turn, cutting baggage and boarding card fees and introducing assigned seating on all planes - copying easyJet and 
tearing up some of the basic tenets of his low-cost bible. But he has shown no sign of changing the brash style that 
many travellers cite as a reason for not flying with Ryanair; he said in an interview with Reuters that he had no 
intention of overhauling the company's core culture. When he made his debut on Twitter to demonstrate a new 
openness in an airline that long took complaints only by post, he donned an Irish leprechaun costume to post 
messages, some of them crude, jokingly threatening to break a customer's ankle if she didn't fly again soon with 
Ryanair. The airline's planes, he said, were powered by his "bulls**t". "The approach for the last 25 years has been, 
'We hate customers, but you shouldn't care because we have the cheapest ticket'," said an executive who has 
known O'Leary for years and who declined to be named. "I would deeply question whether under Michael's 
leadership they have the ability to transform into that more soft, cuddly airline." Other strategies that have annoyed 
some shareholders include Ryanair's dogged pursuit of a takeover of Aer Lingus, which has led O'Leary to bring 
lawsuits against British and EU regulators and induced a slowness to return a cash pile to shareholders. 
"Constantly fighting the EU does not help Ryanair execute its strategy," said one of Ryanair's 40 largest investors, 
who requested anonymity. "(But) we differentiate between operational excellence and the strategy. O'Leary still has 
a great team around him." (Reuters)

euros - tied up in Ryanair shares, there will be no shocks. And some believe his cost-cutting dogma has been 
embedded so deeply in the company's DNA that when he does leave, the company's core strength will remain 
undiminished. "His personality isn't why the business does so well. It does so well because everything is about low 
cost," said Donal O'Neill, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. The latest questions about O'Leary's 
management have been raised after the company announced a series of major policy reversals weeks after their 
first profit warning in a decade - a tacit admission for many that O'Leary had taken cost-cutting and harsh penalties 
for passengers too far. This has allowed rivals like easyJet and Aer Lingus to build their sales pitches on being less 
uncomfortable than Ryanair, though O'Leary says this has not forced the airline to engage in a price war, blaming a 
general weakness across Europe instead. O'Leary has impressed airline industry analysts by the scale of the U-
turn, cutting baggage and boarding card fees and introducing assigned seating on all planes - copying easyJet and 
tearing up some of the basic tenets of his low-cost bible. But he has shown no sign of changing the brash style that 
many travellers cite as a reason for not flying with Ryanair; he said in an interview with Reuters that he had no 
intention of overhauling the company's core culture. When he made his debut on Twitter to demonstrate a new 
openness in an airline that long took complaints only by post, he donned an Irish leprechaun costume to post 
messages, some of them crude, jokingly threatening to break a customer's ankle if she didn't fly again soon with 
Ryanair. The airline's planes, he said, were powered by his "bulls**t". "The approach for the last 25 years has been, 
'We hate customers, but you shouldn't care because we have the cheapest ticket'," said an executive who has 
known O'Leary for years and who declined to be named. "I would deeply question whether under Michael's 
leadership they have the ability to transform into that more soft, cuddly airline." Other strategies that have annoyed 
some shareholders include Ryanair's dogged pursuit of a takeover of Aer Lingus, which has led O'Leary to bring 
lawsuits against British and EU regulators and induced a slowness to return a cash pile to shareholders. 
"Constantly fighting the EU does not help Ryanair execute its strategy," said one of Ryanair's 40 largest investors, 
who requested anonymity. "(But) we differentiate between operational excellence and the strategy. O'Leary still has 
a great team around him." (Reuters)

When one Ryanair shareholder made a stinging attack on Chief Executive Michael O'Leary at the airline's annual 
meeting for scaring off customers with his "bullying" and "macho" style, there was one thing he didn't mention.
That O'Leary's leaving was one of his biggest fears.
As Ryanair scrambles to reinvent itself and woo customers from higher-cost rivals to fill hundreds of new planes, 
there are growing concerns about the cost of what O'Leary recently described as his "personal character 
deformities".
But with his heir apparent about to leave - and as a series of profit warnings eat away at O'Leary's air of invincibility 
- a bigger worry is that Europe's largest airline has left itself over-dependent on a single personality. "On the main 
issues he has been hugely successful ... but there is some really bad stuff," said Alan Marlborough, a private 
shareholder with a sizeable portion of his savings in Ryanair, a month after his AGM outburst. "Is the company 
over-dependent on him? I think it is." Asked, however, if O'Leary's departure was one of the biggest concerns for 
Ryanair, he told Reuters: "I totally agree." O'Leary, an outspoken and hard-charging 52-year-old who used to run 
newsagent shops, has been in charge of Ryanair since 1994 and is described by executives who have worked with 
him as a workaholic with a forensic knowledge of every aspect of the company. A near-religious devotion to cost-
cutting has allowed him to transform a small loss-making regional airline into the biggest carrier by passenger 
numbers in Europe, and in turn transform the industry. But now budget airlines' customer care is under scrutiny, 
particularly at Ryanair. Critics say O'Leary's brusque personality and expletive-filled rants have helped to alienate 
swathes of potential customers, while his domination of decision-making has meant a number of strategic mistakes. 
The stress of no-frills flying and rigid enforcement of fines for baggage size has left some passengers sobbing at 
the airport gate, and the Irish firm was voted the worst of the 100 biggest brands serving the British market by 
Investors love/hate O'Leary relationship Ryanair AGM
readers of consumer magazine Which? Other shareholders chimed in at the AGM with anecdotes about family 
members refusing to fly Ryanair and verbal attacks they had suffered at dinner parties. O'Leary nodded sheepishly 
as he faced up to the concerns about the "abrupt" culture. "It's a committee of one in most instances," said one of 
Ryanair's 10 largest shareholders, who blames O'Leary for costly decisions like "screwing up" fuel hedging in 2009 
and a "disastrous" push into in-flight entertainment. But the shareholder, who requested anonymity, is resigned to 
taking the bad with the good and cannot see many worthy alternative leaders to take the place of the man who has 
overseen a tenfold rise in the share price in 15 years. "Replacing O'Leary is like replacing Alex Ferguson," he said, 
a comparison with the manager of Manchester United soccer team, who retired this year after nearly 27 trophy-filled 
years. "It will be extremely tough for anyone to replicate what he has achieved." O'Leary has said repeatedly he 
would leave when Ryanair ends its fast growth stage and enters comfortable middle age, but he said in an interview 
last week that would not be soon, with the deliveries of 175 new planes starting next year. The replacement of 
retiring deputy chief executive Michael Cawley with two senior executives in March will give signs of O'Leary's 
thinking on strategy and succession. Shareholders trust that with most of O'Leary's wealth - around 275 million 
euros - tied up in Ryanair shares, there will be no shocks. And some believe his cost-cutting dogma has been 
embedded so deeply in the company's DNA that when he does leave, the company's core strength will remain

The ISEQ is well ahead this morning at 4,403 up 37 points as European markets forge ahead to new 5 year highs.
Cantor Fitzgerald looks at Aer Lingus
this morning:
Aer Lingus (N/C) reiterated its full year guidance in their Q3 IMS, covering the period from 1 July 2013 - 30 
September 2013. The airline reported an operating profit of E94.9m, representing a 4.4pc increase YoY. Short haul 
fare revenue declined by 5.8pc YoY, 2pc YTD, negatively impacted by exceptionally good weather, and a 
competitive pricing environment. The extra capacity added to the North Atlantic was absorbed successfully with 
long haul revenue climbing 12.4pc, and load factor increasing by 0.4 percentage points. Further progress was made 
on reducing staff costs, which declined by 3.1pc (-4.2pc YTD) over the quarter, while fuel costs rose 3pc (-1.6pc 
YTD). Comment: Following yesterday's warning by Ryanair, it was comforting that management reiterated FY13 
operating profit targets of ~E60m. The group appears confident that a solid performance in long haul should offset 
weakness in short haul, where the market remains characterised by heavily discounted fare offerings across 
Europe. Management continued to express its disappointment that a failure to resolve the pension issue was 
negatively impacting the group's ability to deliver efficiencies and cost saving measures. Aer Lingus trades on 10.3x 
forward earnings while yielding a dividend of 2.9pc according to Cantor Fitzgerald.

Thirty start-up companies will create 218 jobs over the next 12 months, Taoiseach Enda Kenny is expected to 
announce tonight.
Details of the jobs at companies backed by the Dublin Business Innovation Centre will emerge at a function to mark 
the centre's 25th anniversary.

EmpowerTheUser, iCabbi, Learnosity, MMSOFT Design, OpenJaw Technologies, Point of Care, Stratus5 and 
SafeFood 360.
They come a day after Enterprise Ireland agreed to stump up a quarter of the equity for a new E125 million 
investment fund for more established, medium-sized businesses.
The rest of the cash will be provided by AIB, which has committed E20 million, and three foreign investors. The Irish

the retailer's loans with Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which are up for sale. It is unclear who the backer is but 
informed sources said it was a party "knowledgeable of retail". Ulster Bank, which jointly controls Arnotts with IBRC, 
is understood to be supportive of this bid, although this could not be confirmed with the British lender last night. The 
offer is believed to have made it through to the second stage of bidding for the loans, which is being run by the

expects the "out-turn to be between E500 million and E520 million due entirely to this lower fare environment". 
Earlier warning This is up to 20 per cent lower than the E570 million to E600 million full-year profit it predicted in an 
earlier warning issued exactly two months ago on September 4th. The Irish Times XXXX Aer Lingus has reported a 
third quarter operating profit of E94.9 million, up 4.4 per cent on the previous year despite challenging conditions.

 Euromonitor International released its annual Global Trends Report Monday in conjunction with the opening of the 
World Travel Market (WTM) trade show in London. In it, researchers highlighted seven regional trends and two 
global ones that track emerging behavior patterns, new travel habits and business initiatives across the globe. 
Scroll down for a complete breakdown of what to expect in the world to travel and tourism in the coming years.
 Europe: Peer-to-Peer Travel
 HouseTrip is a major peer-to-peer player in Europe. screengrab 
 Expect your favorite European travel companies to jump onto the 'peer-to-peer' bandwagon in 2014 as cost-
conscious travelers share their resources amid the age of austerity. The WTM Global Trends Report finds that peer-
to-peer services have recorded strong growth in Europe, offering 'authentic experiences at affordable prices.'
 'The future of peer-to-peer holiday rentals really depends on legislation, but I believe that there are very good 
prospects,' Arnaud Bertrand, chief executive of HouseTrip.com, commented in the survey. 'Hosts earn extra money 
for their pocket and guests get more value from their travel dollar, so it is an attractive proposition.'
 Travelers not only share accommodation, but swap cars on sites like Blablacar.com and offer unique tours and 
travel experiences on sites like Vayable.com. Forbes magazine estimates that revenues across the sharing 
economy will grow by 25 percent by the end of 2013.
 UK: Travel Happiness Index
 Routehappy ranks flights by a "happiness" index. screengrab 
 Are you happy with your experience in the sky? That question is of increasing importance to British travelers who 
seek higher 'happiness scores' on sites like Routehappy.com when booking, according to the WTM Global Trends 
Report.
 'Our Happiness Score is very important to airlines. Why? Airlines are working hard to move away from air travel 
being a commoditized, price- and schedule-only decision,' explained Routehappy's founder and chief executive, 
Robert Albert.
Travel Trends To Look Out For In 2014
 Even notoriously ornery budget carrier Ryanair recently went on a charm offensive to woo passengers back after 
years of questionable customer service practices and punitive fees. If the new Euromonitor report is any indication, 
happiness is back on the agenda.
 Middle East: Low Cost Goes Upmarket
 Budget carrier Jazeera Airways has skewed more upmarket in recent years. Reuters 
 The Middle East, home of the ultra-luxury liner, is seeing a few more frills added to its budget airlines, according to 
the WTM Global Trends Report, which notes: 'A less expected outcome of the luxury orientation of Middle Eastern 
travelers is the introduction of luxury services aboard low-cost carriers.'
 One example is Jazeera Airways, which was the first in the region to add business class in 2009, whilst keeping 
lower prices and maintaining profitability. 'A new business model had to be adopted, whereby the airline moved 
away from the low-cost model,' Stefan Pichler, former chief executive of Jazeera Airways, said of Jazeera's move in 
the report. 'Jazeera cancelled the 'pay for food' model, and introduced duty-free on-board as well as a business 
class.'
 Others like Flydubai have followed suit with new business class services.
 Africa: The Big Five With Your Little One
 U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, her daughters Sasha and Malia, mother Marian Robinson, niece Leslie Robinson 
and nephew Avery Robinson ride a vehicle at a safari in Madikwe Game Reserve. Reuters 
 Hollywood blockbusters like 'Madagascar' and 'The Lion King' (recently re-released in 3-D) may be partially 
responsible for a rise in popularity of child-friendly safaris in Africa. The WTM Global Trends Report finds that many 
safaris in South Africa, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania, once considered unsuitable for young ones, now 
avoid long game drives and tailor their offerings to suit kid's shorter attention spans.
 'For each of the past three years our family safari bookings have nearly doubled,' Ben Morison, managing director 
of safari specialist Imagine Africa, noted in the report. 'People are getting more and more adventurous, and want 
more exciting experiences with their children. Not only parents, but grandparents too.'
 Large family trips by residents of the so-called BRIC nations -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- have fueled the 
trend of multi-generational holidays in Africa, according to researchers. Caroline Bremner of Euromonitor 
International expects similar growth to expand beyond safaris to volunteerism, cruising and more sustainable 
holidays over the next few years.
 Asia: Fight for Cruise Control in China

 If we are to believe the researchers behind the WTM Global Trends Report, the Chinese cruise market is set to 
boom in a major way and become the second largest in the world behind the U.S. by 2017. Though still in its 
infancy (and lacking sufficient ports of call), cruise operators appear keen to jump onboard and expand their 
offerings in the region.
 'The potential for China's cruise market is vast but -- as this report highlights -- the government needs to integrate 
airports, rail and roads so that passengers can easily reach the new cruise terminals,' Simon Press of Reed Travel 
Exhibitions noted. 'The lack of infrastructure appears to be the biggest impediment to growth.'
 Nevertheless, Carnival Asia expects at least 7 million cruise passengers to come from Asia by 2020, while 
Princess Cruises expects Asia to represent about one in five cruisers by that same time.
 India: The Travel Social Shake Up

Travel Trends To Look Out For In 2014
 Surprise! India's online travel agencies are now prioritizing social media to woo the young urban consumer. While 
this may sound like old news to many, just 12 percent of the Indian population is online (though Facebook boasts 
82 million Indian users, making it the website's third-largest market).
 'Leads through social media have risen from nil about two years ago to about 20 percent now,' Arjun Sharma, 
managing director of TUI India, commented in the report. Researchers found that some 70 percent of all four- and 
five-star hotels in India's main cities had a social media presence by summer 2013, while the Indian Ministry of 
Tourism recently began using social media to promote tourism sites throughout the country.
 'India is predicted to have more than 300 million Internet users by 2017, with 75 percent of them active on social 
media, so the potential is staggering,' Press of Reed Travel Exhibitions added. 'Figures also show that online travel 
retail sales in India are forecast to reach $14.7 billion in 2017, following a 19 percent CAGR [compound annual 
growth rate] from 2012, so travel firms need to act now.'

 In what is perhaps the most bizarre and unexpected of all trends highlighted in the WTM Global Trends Report, 
researchers predict a rise in PANKs -- 'Professional Aunts, No Kids' -- who collectively spend billions on traveling 
with nieces and nephews.
 Melanie Notkin, chief executive at Savvy Auntie, a U.S.-based website community for aunts and godmothers, 
estimates there are 23 million PANKs in the U.S. who spend a whopping $9 billion annually on children. 'PANKs 
want to have meaningful experiences with the children in their lives and develop strong bonds with them, which 
makes travel an ideal product for this demographic,' Notkin commented in the report.
 Bremner of Euromonitor International added: 'The travel industry has great expertise in creating and marketing 
family products and will reap benefits by expanding the term 'family' to PANKs and other non-traditional family 
types.'
 Travel Technology: Mobile Concierge

 The WTM Travel Trends Report found that travelers now expect instantaneous answers and greater customization

Tourism Board and InterContinental Hotels have tapped into mobile technology to offer assistance.
 TUI Travel recently released a Digital Assistant app that gives customers advice throughout the trip. The similar 
YourSingapore Guide app from the Singapore Tourism Board aims to make the city experience as personal and 
smooth as possible. InterContinental Hotels' Concierge Insider Guides app, meanwhile, offers insights from the 
company concierges at 127 global properties.
 'By 2017, the mobile channel is expected to account for over 30 percent of online travel value sales,' Bremner of 
Euromonitor International explained in the report. 'All the signs indicate that mobile will be at the core of customer 
relationships in travel.'

 Behold the rise of 'microstays,' an attractive means of boosting hotel revenues by targeting business travelers on

of shifting their offerings to provide businesses with workspaces on demand.
 'Our busy lifestyles mean more of us are '24-hour travelers,' so facilities offered by hotels on this day-use basis are 
bound to be increasingly important,' Bremner noted. 'These developments all suggest that hotels will become 
'offices of the future', and this is very much likely to become a global trend.'

So you thought Ryanair, efficient but abrasive, had suddenly turned cuddly? Michael O'Leary , boss of Europe's 
largest low-cost airline, may have wooed some additional fliers with recent talk of customer care and extra 
handbags on board. But a second profit warning in two months yesterday did nothing for the airline's investors. 
Shares in Ryanair fell 13 per cent, to trade on less than 13 times 2013-14 earnings. And Mr O'Leary's willingness to 
cut ticket prices to hold on to customers and market share in what Ryanair describes as a soft market rocked its 
European rivals, too. Bloomberg's Europe, Middle East and Africa airline index slipped 4 per cent.
A big question is where this weakness emanates from. Europe's airline industry survived the recent recession with 
surprisingly good pricing discipline. Now, just as the general climate improves, Ryanair reports tougher price 
competition and softer economic conditions, plus adverse exchange rates. The last explanation is intuitive, the first 
two are more puzzling. True, industry seat capacity is rising, led by low-cost carriers while some flag carriers 
continue to cut back. For example, Deutsche Bank thinks Europe's domestic winter capacity could rise about 5 per 
cent this year. Even so, it is not soaring away. Which prompts speculation that fliers are either fed up with Ryanair's 
service or that the carrier is deliberating taking a market share fight to its rivals. Mr O'Leary, though, points to 
customer growth to rebut the first theory and calls the latter "an outrageous slur". Ryanair is responding to 
conditions, he says.
But perhaps investors shouldn't agonise too much. If Ryanair competes fiercely on prices in the near-term, this is 
likely to push down industry margins. That, in turn, may spur consolidation. And while the Irish carrier will give up 
some short-term profit, it may stand to benefit longer-term, with share gains in a rationalised European short-haul 
Charge of the flight brigade
market. It is a strategy that Ryanair's low cost structure and solid balance sheet permits. But it is definitely not 
cuddly.

Highlight: Second guidance cut in two months
Airline highlights 'weaker pricing'
Body
Ryanair's shares plunged yesterday after Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue issued its second profit 
warning in two months.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the Irish airline was partly the "author" of the reduced profit 
guidance because its fares are being cut aggressively in response to increased competition and weak economic 
conditions.
He suggested some rivals might fail because of the price war, with analysts adding that Ryanair was intent to 
preserve or increase its market share in advance of expanding its fleet next year.
Ryanair now expects its earnings to fall in 2013-14 compared with 2012-13 - the first decline in five years.
It reduced its net profit forecast to EUR500m to EUR520m for the year to March 31 2014, having said on 
September 4 that earnings would be at the lower end of a range of EUR570m to EUR600m.
Ryanair's average fares have been rising for five years, but are expected to fall by 4 per cent in 2013-14, partly 
because of negative exchange rate movements.
Ryanair in fresh warning on profits TRAVEL & LEISURE
Mr O'Leary highlighted "weaker pricing" partly due to "weaker demand". He added: "What we tend to do in these 
periods when pricing is weak - as we did after 9/11; as we did after the London bombings; as we did after any other 
events, is lorry out loads of cheap fares.
"If a couple of competitors get blown up as part of that process - well and good."
Ryanair and easyJet, Europe's second largest low-cost carrier, face a growing challenge by a group of budget 
airlines led by Norwegian Air Shuttle, International Airlines Group's Vueling and Budapest-based Wizz Air.
Shares in Ryanair closed down 12.6 per cent at EUR5.33. Shares in easyJet, Norwegian and IAG were down 5.1 
per cent, 3.9 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively.
Donal O'Neill, analyst at Goodbody, said: "Ryanair sees a competitive threat, both short-term and long- term in . . . 
key markets."
Ryanair starts taking delivery of 175 Boeing passenger jets next September, and it is using the intervening period to 
improve customer service. It sees this as important to increasing its passengers from 79.3m in 2012-13 to 110m in 
2018-19.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair's website was "crap" but was undergoing an overhaul. A move to allocated seating on all 
the carrier's flights by February was in response to demand. Customers must pay EUR5 to select their seats at 
least one day before flying.
Ryanair reported revenue of EUR3.3bn for the six months to September 30, up 5 per cent compared with the same 
time last year. Net profit rose 1 per cent to EUR602m - highlighting how Ryanair expects to record losses in the 
second half of 2013-14.

BRITAIN'S FTSE 100 share index pushed ahead yesterday, as its biggest stock HSBC rose after solid results, 
outweighing weakness in the airline and engineering sectors following profit warnings.
HSBC advanced 2.3 per cent in its biggest one-day rise in four months after quarterly profits rose by a tenth, year-
on-year, meeting analyst expectations and reassuring investors unnerved by weak numbers from several peers.
Investor interest was further fanned by the stock's underperformance over the past three months, which has left it at 
its steepest discount to the FTSE 100 since February 2012, and second steepest in the past five years based on 
12-month earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.
Analysts at Barclays said the results and outlook were "reassuring", reiterating their overweight rating. HSBC, which 
accounts for 7.5 per cent of FTSE 100 capitalisation, was responsible for nearly half the index's gains yesterday.
"We have it as one of our preferred selections in the sector ... Their statement was a reflection that things are not 
that bad out there," said Peter Botham, CIO at Brown Shipley.
"Fundamentally we are still optimistic on the outlook but the biggest uncertainty is whether equities now fully reflect 
the likely growth of next year, or whether there is still further to go."
Aside from HSBC, the corporate newsflow offered some cause for caution, with profit warnings from engineering 
firm Weir Group and budget airline Ryanair sending their respective shares down 3.7 and 12.8 per cent. Ryanair 
results also weighed on rival Easyjet.
But the much bigger weighting of HSBC - coupled with gains in big name mining stocks thanks to strong data from 
top metals consumer China - kept the overall blue-chip index firmly in positive territory.

Broad sentiment also benefited from growing expectations that the European Central Bank will focus on stimulating 
the economy at this week's meeting, with some even seeing a chance of an interest rate cut following a surprise 
drop in inflation. The FTSE 100 closed up 28.88 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 6,763.62 points, moving back towards a 
five-month high of 6,819 hit last week.
Technical analysts said the May peak of 6,875.62 was the next key target.

Competition worries have been the bane of Imagination Technologies shareholders. The graphics chip designer 
has tumbled more than 60 per cent since mid-2012 as key customers such as Samsung spread their risk by 
licensing rival designs, writesBryce Elder  .
The latest worry was that Imagination would lose its monopoly with MediaTek, the maker of processors used in 
most low-end Android phones. MediaTek is expected to account for about a quarter of Imagination's shipments this 
year, making it the group's second-biggest customer after Apple.
But the talk at an Arm developer conference last week was that MediaTek "will likely pursue a more aggressive 
dual-sourcing strategy for graphics," said UBS. The loss would make Imagination management's target of hitting 
1bn units by 2016 look challenging, UBS said. Its analysts had previously expected Apple and MediaTek to provide 
three-quarters of that target.
UBS set a 240p price target on Imagination, which fell 3.2 per cent to 261.4p.
The wider market was lifted by reassuring results from HSBC and a rally among the miners. The FTSE 100 rose 0.4 
per cent or 28.88 points at 6,763.62, with HSBC alone contributing 16 points.

sector's poor capital discipline, as a non-executive director. "Investors should feel they now have one of their own

Airlines dropped after Ryanair cut earnings guidance, blaming pressure on fares from stiffer competition. Ryanair 
slumped 12.8 per cent to EUR5.32 and EasyJet, which has results on November 19, was down 5.1 per cent to 
£12.30.
A mild profit warning pushed Weir Group 3.7 per cent lower to £21.73.
Aerospace engineer Meggitt lost a further 3 per cent to 493.9p following last week's profit warning, which it blamed 
largely on operational problems.
President Energy jumped 16.2 per cent to 33.5p after the explorer hired Schlumberger to begin drilling in 
Paraguay in the first half of 2014. The company repeated its initial assessment that its licences could hold at least 
500m barrels of oil.

Airlines dropped after Ryanair cut earnings guidance, blaming pressure on fares from stiffer competition. On the 
post-results conference call, chief executive Michael O'Leary set out his plan to undermine easyJet's advantages by 
undercutting its rival while adding capacity to city centre airports and improving customer service. Ryanair declined 
12.8 per cent to EUR5.32 and easyJet , which has results on November 19, was down 5.1 per cent to £12.30.
A mild profit warning pushed Weir Group 3.7 per cent lower to £21.73. The pumpmaker said investment in 
greenfield mining projects had been delayed, oil drilling had been more gradual than expected and industrial orders 
had fallen sharply. Weir's guidance cut about 5 per cent off 2013 earnings forecasts, though the bigger uncertainty 
was whether forecasts of a better 2014 could be relied on. About 10 per cent of Weir's free float has been loaned to 
short sellers, down from a peak of about 26 per cent last year.
Aerospace engineer Meggitt lost a further 3 per cent to 493.9p following last week's profit warning, which it blamed 
largely on operational problems. Analysts were more worried about the future of Meggitt's business servicing 
private jets.
"Weak commentary on commercial after-market is likely to renew investor concerns over the age of Meggitt's 
installed base and its exposure to increasing retirements," said Morgan Stanley.
President Energy jumped 16.2 per cent to 33.5p after the explorer hired Schlumberger to begin drilling in 
Paraguay in the first half of 2014. The company repeated its initial assessment that its licences could hold at least

MICHAEL O'Leary's new, customer-friendly persona was out in force yesterday when he was asked about his 
response to his rivals' ticket prices. "I don't give a toss… in a warm and cuddly sort of way," he told reporters.
And when asked about whether Ryanair's profit warning spelled the end of the no-frills experience, he pondered: 
"What frills do BA give you besides delays and lost bags?" But while O'Leary was holding court with reporters, CFO 
Howard Millar had a tougher time with sceptical analysts, who were struggling to pin down why Ryanair's average 
fares were falling.
Scribblers at Deutsche pointed out that Ryanair enjoys a lack of competition on routes accounting for half of its 
seats - so the firm can't really claim to be engulfed in a price war, particularly when in the same results presentation 
it lampooned the likes of EasyJet and Lufthansa for increasing fares.
A poll for the World Travel Market, which is taking place in London this week, found that nofrills business trips are 
soaring in popularity, particularly in the Middle East. Ryanair's move into fully allocated seating, a fleet of new 
planes on the way in late 2014 and O'Leary's new desire for "my customers to love me as much as I love them" 
could tap into this booming market.
But before that, the firm needs to ensure its (relatively) nice new look attracts passengers in the growing economies 
of Europe for more than just rock-bottom prices, before two profit warnings turn into three.

SHARES in Ryanair took a 12.6 per cent dive yesterday after the low-cost airline cut its full-year profit forecast for 
the second time in as many months.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said its move to lower air fares across its routes had contributed to the gloomy profit 
outlook, but said he was unsure of the cause of the price pressure beyond "three to four years of austerity across 
Europe".
And the firm's capacity will fall next summer - the first time it has failed to add seats in 25 years - due to a lag 
between the end of some leases and the delivery of new planes from Boeing.
"It's a bit grim at the moment, but that's good because it means fares are going to fall," O'Leary told reporters.
Ryanair expects to make between (EURO)500m and (EURO)520m in the year to the end of March 2014, down 
from a (EURO)570m to (EURO)600m range predicted earlier in the year. It warned in September that it might fall 
short of its range.
The firm has also trimmed its traffic forecasts from 81.5m to just under 81m.
It reported a profit after tax of (EURO)602m for the first half, a rise of one per cent on a year ago, but expects to 
lose around (EURO)90m in the next six months, meaning annual profits will fall for the first time in five years.
Average fares fell two per cent in the half-year in the wake of its price cuts, but ancillary revenues rose 22 per cent 
to (EURO)713m as the first wave of seat reservations on Ryanair flights proved popular. The firm revealed that all 
of its seats will be allocated from 1 February, with passengers able to pay £5 to pick a seat, rising to £10 for chairs

YES Brenda Kelly Ryanair looks set to record its fifth consecutive month of share price declines, and has seen a fall 
of over 28 per cent since July. The concept of low-cost flights, of which Ryanair was one of the first adopters, has to 
a degree been cannibalised by other airlines, making competition fiercer than ever. When you have the likes of Aer 
Lingus and easyJet all vying for the same business, it's not difficult to see where the profit is flowing. The notion of 
allowing passengers to bring more than one bag on board, along with allocated seating, indicates that Ryanair is no 
longer the pioneer of the discount airline rules - rather it is backtracking in an effort to be more like its rivals. Mild 
attempts have been made to address the poor image and reputation garnered by the airline in recent years. But 
regaining lost customers is a difficult task, and the uphill battle the airline will face is likely to be reflected in the 
share price in the near term. We won't be hearing fanfares anytime soon.
Brenda Kelly is senior market analyst at www.IG.NO David Buik Since Ryanair was founded in 1985, the budget 
airline's operations have mushroomed and it now provides flights to 830 routes in Europe and North Africa. Its 
growth and development have been masterminded by the ebullient and arrogantly innovative Michael O'Leary. But 
Ryanair's share price has long been based on expectations, with losses being posted with monotonous regularity. 
Yesterday's figures reduced the profit forecast for the year to £500m and triggered a significant drop in its share 
price. However, despite introducing gargantuan passenger charges, O'Leary has built a plausible business model. 
Already, Ryanair is on the charm offensive - listening to customers and introducing allocated seating. He may have 
failed in his attempt to buy Aer Lingus to boost his embryonic trans-Atlantic operation, but today's profits warning is 
no more than a spot of temporary turbulence.

Shares in Ryanair slumped after Europe's top budget airline issued a new, harsher profits warning and pledged to 
maintain heavy fare discounts to keep aircraft full.
Stock in the Dublin-based carrier fell 11.5 percent to 5.40 euros ($7.30), a two-month low.
Ryanair had issued an initial, milder profits warning Sept. 4 citing weaker-than-expected demand and the need to 
reduce the average price of fares. Monday's forecast means the airline is on course to record its first major drop in 
profits following two decades of industry-leading expansion.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said projected profits for the fiscal year 2014 would fall to a range of 500 million 
euros to 520 million euros ($675 million to $700 million), reflecting expected heavy losses in the weaker winter 
months.
Ryanair had previously said profits would grow to up to 600 million euros for the 2014 fiscal year, following net 
profits of 569 million euros last year. O'Leary cited declining demand across Europe as the sole reason for the 
weakened outlook.
He said Ryanair would keep seats filled by lowering fares an average 9 percent in the current quarter and 
potentially more in the first quarter of 2014.
Ryanair's first-half results offered no surprises. Sales for the April-September period rose 5 percent to 3.26 billion 
euros as the airline carried 49 million passengers, a 2 percent gain. Net profits rose 1 percent to 602 million euros.
The forecast means Ryanair expects to record second-half losses of up to 100 million euros.
Ryanair also announced it would introduce fully assigned seating in February, a significant cultural change for the 
company that reflected heavy customer criticism of existing policies.
Ryanair shares slump 11 pct on new profits warning
For decades Ryanair had required passengers to form lengthy queues to maintain position for an at-times unseemly 
scramble for unassigned seats. That practice saved Ryanair costs but meant couples, families or groups sometimes 
couldn't sit together.
O'Leary said passengers wishing to book a particular seat would be charged 5 euros ($6.75) each, while all others 
would be assigned seats for free the day before the flight.
O'Leary said he expected Ryanair to resume expansion as it starts to receive the first aircraft from a blockbuster 
175-plane deal with sole supplier Boeing. "High-cost competitor airlines are continuing to cut capacity in major 
markets such as France, Germany, Poland, Spain and Italy, and this continues to create growth opportunities for 
Ryanair," he said.

Expectations of monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank, coupled with a rise in HSBC, drove European 
shares to a 5-year high today.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up by 0.4 percent at 1,294.70 points in late session trading, having 
hit a high of 1,297.01.
The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index also advanced 0.4 percent, to 3,063.90 points, while Germany's 
DAX - which hit a record high of 9,070.17 points last week - rose 0.3 percent to 9,035.36 points.
British bank HSBC rose 2.9 percent to add the most points to the FTSEurofirst 300 after posting a 10-percent rise in 
third quarter profits and issuing a positive outlook. European equity markets were also supported by expectations 
that the ECB will take on an accommodativetone towards helping the region's economy at its policy meeting on 
Thursday, after a drop in euro zone inflation in October. UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland are anticipating an 
interest rate cut although many others expect the ECB to hold fire on concrete action until at least December. "An 
accomodative stance by the ECB is by now not only expected by investors but also demanded politically. So, for a 
while, the risk is for a break to the upside on equities," SteppenWolf Capital chief investment officer, Phoebus 
Theologites, said. Moves by major central banks to lift the global economy after the 2008 financial crisis have 
enabled stock markets to keep rising, even in the face of weak corporate earnings. According to Thomson Reuters 
StarMine data, 53 percent of companies on the pan-European STOXX 600 index have missed market expectations 
with their third quarter results, including Ryanair which slumped 13.4 percent after it cut its earnings outlook. 
Nevertheless, the FTSEurofirst 300 remains up by 14 percent since the start of 2013 and SVM Asset Management 
fund manager Margaret Lawson said she felt signs that the European economy was slowly recovering would lift 
equities further. Today, data from Markit showed that euro zone manufacturing activity accelerated in October as 
new orders increased for the fourth month in a row. Margaret Lawson added: "The Continent has had its economic

difficulties but with ongoing austerity curbing wage inflation and major cost cutting programs, many European 
companies are looking very competitive. If we start to see any pick-up in economic activity, these businesses are 
sitting on substantial operational leverage and could see earnings rise very quickly." (Reuters)

The ISEQ is significantly lower this morning at 4,350, down 42 points as Ryanair forecasts impact disproportionately 
on the reducing Irish index.
Davy Stockbrokers sees Ireland benefiting from the rise in World prospects:
European stock indices fell on Friday: the Euro Stoxx 50 fell 0.5pc but the S and P500 rose 0.3pc. Weak earnings 
from Royal Bank of Scotland and Renault held back European indices, but a stronger-than-expected ISM 
manufacturing survey helped US sentiment. US 10-year treasury yields advanced through the day, up 6 basis 
points to 2.62pc.
The surprise fall in euro area CPI inflation to just 0.7pc continued to weigh on the euro, currently trading at dollar 
1.349 against the dollar, down by 3.5c from levels above dollar 1.38 on Thursday. The key releases today are the 
European PMI manufacturing surveys for October. The euro area survey is expected to remain at 51.3, indicating 
the sector is expanding. On Friday, the China PMI (51.4), US ISM (56.4) and UK PMI (56.0) October releases all 
pointed to a robust recovery in global manufacturing output. In this context, Ireland is not being left behind, with its 
PMI survey for manufacturing up to 54.9 in October, the fifth successive month indicating expansion. The headline 
ESRI/KBC Irish consumer confidence survey rose to 76.3 in October, up from 73.1 in September and the strongest 
level since 2007. The marginal rise in the headline ESRI/KBC measure did not match the surge in the EU 
Commission measure back into positive territory (+2.6), the highest level since February 2006. This could suggest 
Irish consumer confidence has recovered more quickly than the headline measure indicates. We will now look to 
today's October Exchequer Returns, specifically VAT receipts, for a better picture of how consumer spending has 
performed in the second half of 2013 according to Davy Stockbrokers.

Ryanair's annual profit is set to fall for the first time in five years as intense competition in Europe pushes average 
fares down by around 10 percent over the winter months, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers said 
today.
Two months after issuing its first profit warning in a decade, the Irish budget carrier cut its profit forecast further for 
its current financial year ending in March to around 510 million euros (dollar 688 million) from 570 million euros.
Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar said passenger numbers were stable and on-board spending was growing, but 
that people were only booking discount fares, a sign Europe may not be recovering as quickly as many people 
hoped.
"At the macro level in Europe signals have gone green, but on the micro level things don't seem to be as strong as 
people think," he told Reuters. The weak numbers coincide with the airline's efforts to attract premium passengers 
from low-cost rivals like easyJet and Norwegian. In the latest of a series of radical changes to the airline's no-frills 
model, Ryanair said it would allocate all seats on its planes, ending the often frenzied rush by passengers to secure 
the best seats. But management said the recently announced changes, which included a halving of some baggage 
charges, would not have a significant impact on the current financial year. "These things aren't instant" said Millar, 
who forecast it could take 12-18 months for the changes to make an impact. The airline met analysts' forecasts with 
a profit of 602 million euros for six months to September, up 1 percent on the year, as a fall of 2 percent in average 
fares was compensated by a 22 percent rise in extra charges. Analysts said there could be some upside in the 
2014-2015 financial year, which includes two Easter periods, and should see the impact of recent cuts to charges in 
key airports and lower fuel prices. But Millar said it was too early to predict how they would impact profitability. 
Ryanair in September had warned that its profit would be at the bottom of a previously announced 570 million-600 
million euro range. On Monday it said that would fall to between 500 million and 520 million, below the 569 million

(RTTNews) - The UK market is trading higher on Monday, after China's non-manufacturing sector expanded at a 
faster pace in October, and investors remained hopeful ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy 
meeting scheduled for Thursday.
China's non-manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in October, a combined survey by the China 
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing and the National Bureau of Statistics revealed Sunday. The official 
purchasing managers' index for the service sector moved up to 56.3 in October from 55.4 in September.
The Eurozone manufacturing sector carried its modest third quarter recovery into the final quarter of the year as 
initially estimated, final data from Markit Economics showed Monday. The manufacturing PMI rose to 51.3 from 
51.1 in September, in line with flash estimate.
Meanwhile, activity in the French manufacturing sector decreased for the twentieth consecutive month in October,

The seasonally adjusted PMI for the manufacturing sector dropped to 49.1 in October from 49.8 in September. The 
flash estimates were for a score of 49.4.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said the central bank's accommodative monetary 
policy has been countered by Federal government's inability to resolve the budget stalemate, delaying the U.S. 
economic recovery.
"The economy of the United States is hog-tied by a government that is sadly ineffective and, in fact, 
counterproductive. The inability of our government to get its act together has countered the pro-cyclical role of the 
Federal Reserve," Fisher told before the Australian Business Economists in Sydney today.

UK Market Rises
Antofagasta is rising 1.9 percent and Aberdeen Asset Management is advancing 1.6 percent.

On the economic front, the British economy will likely expand at a faster pace than estimated earlier on improved 
business investment and exports, a report from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) revealed Sunday. The 
economy is set to remain steady through 2015 and beyond, it said.
The latest economic forecast from the CBI showed that the economy would expand 1.4 percent this year, faster 
than 1.2 percent the business lobby had predicted in August. The upward revision mainly reflects third quarter's 
better-than expected GDP growth and improving sentiment across the major business sectors.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Sunday that the government should strike a balance between maintaining growth 
and restructuring the economy. "We must find a golden balance" between reforming the economic structure and 
maintaining a reasonable growth rate, Li was quoted as saying by state media.

(RTTNews) - The European markets ended the first day of the new trading week in positive territory. The markets 
received a boost from the increase in Chinese non-manufacturing data, as well as the positive European 
manufacturing PMI reports for October. Investors were also encouraged by strong quarterly results from HSBC. 
However, airline stocks were weak after Ryanair slashed its guidance.
China's non-manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in October, a combined survey by the China 
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing and the National Bureau of Statistics revealed Sunday. The official 
purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the service sector moved up to 56.3 in October from 55.4 in September. In 
August, the score was 53.9.
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said the central bank's accommodative monetary policy 
has been countered by Federal government's inability to resolve the budget stalemate, delaying the U.S. economic 
recovery.
"The economy of the United States is hog-tied by a government that is sadly ineffective and, in fact,

Euro area banking assets dropped nearly 12 percent by the end of 2012 compared with 2008, with significant 
adjustments taking place in 2009 amid the global financial crisis, the European Central Bank said in a report on 
Monday.
The banking sector assets in Eurozone totaled EUR 29.5 trillion, the ECB said in its latest Banking Structures 
Report, which analyzed the main structural developments in the euro area banking sector: the capacity, 
consolidation and concentration of banks and related changes over time.
On a consolidated basis, the number of credit institutions shrunk 10 percent to 2,645 from 2,909 during the four-
year period, the report said.
However, the median Tier 1 capital ratio in the euro area increased to 12.7 percent in 2012 from 8 percent in 2008.
The British economy will likely expand at a faster pace than estimated earlier on improved business investment and 
exports, and is set to remain steady through 2015 and beyond, a report from the Confederation of British Industry

The latest economic forecast from the CBI showed that the economy will expand 1.4 percent this year, faster than 
1.2 percent the business lobby had predicted in August. The upward revision mainly reflects third quarter's better-
than expected GDP growth and improving sentiment across the major business sectors.
Going ahead, the growth rate for 2014 has been upgraded to 2.4 percent from 2.3 percent. Quarter-on-quarter 
growth will be limited to 0.6 percent in every quarter next year as government spending begins to drag on GDP, the 
report said.
Fitch Ratings upgraded the outlook on Spain's sovereign credit rating to 'stable' from 'negative', saying the country's 
banking sector reforms have "advanced well" and that the government has made significant progress in fiscal 
adjustment.
Fitch rates the country's long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings (IDRs) and senior unsecured 
bond ratings at 'BBB'. The short-term foreign currency IDR has been affirmed at 'F2' and the country ceiling at 'AA'.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks increased by 0.26 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, added 0.18 percent.
The DAX of Germany climbed by 0.25 percent and the CAC 40 of France advanced by 0.36 percent. The FTSE 100 
of the U.K. rose by 0.45 percent, but the SMI of Switzerland fell by 0.33 percent.
In Frankfurt, K+S gained 9.27 percent. HSBC upgraded its rating on the stock to 'Neutral'' from ''Underweight.''
Fuchs Petrolub increased by 5.99 percent. The lubricants maker reported higher profit for the first nine months of 
the year, even as adverse currency impacted sales. The company also backed its full year goals.
In Paris, Danone finished lower by 0.87 percent. Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the stock to ''Neutral'' 
from ''Buy.''
In London, HSBC climbed by 2.46 percent, after its third-quarter report.
Weir Group sank by 3.55 percent. The engineering solutions provider said its revenues and profits for the third 
quarter were slightly below expectations, due to project delivery delays in Minerals and a more gradual-than-
anticipated recovery in upstream Oil & Gas markets. The company also issued a profit warning for full-year 2013.
Ryanair plunged by 12.50 percent. The low-cost airline cut its full year profit forecast, citing a fall in average prices. 
Peer easyJet fell by 4.78 percent.
BP advanced by 0.85 percent, after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to "Equal weight" from "Underweight."
PostNL increased by 7.51 percent in Amsterdam, after it raised its full year guidance.
Eurozone investor confidence increased strongly in November, surpassing economists' expectations, to hit a two-
and-a-half year high, a monthly survey by the think tank Sentix showed on Monday. The investor confidence index 
rose for the fourth consecutive month to 9.3 from October's 6.1. Economists were looking for a modest increase to 
6.5.
The Eurozone manufacturing sector carried its modest third quarter recovery into the final quarter of the year as 
initially estimated, final data from Markit Economics showed Monday. The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' 
Index rose to 51.3, in line with flash estimate from 51.1 in September.
Germany's manufacturing sector grew at a faster-than-expected rate during October, led by growth in production 
and new orders, survey data released by Markit Economics showed on Monday. The final Markit/BME Germany 
Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51.7 from September's 51.1. The flash estimate was 51.5.
European Markets Climbed On China Data & European Manufacturing PMIs
Passenger car sales in Germany increased in October after recording a modest decline in the previous month, 
latest figures released by the Federal Motor Transport Authority showed Monday. Registration of new passenger 
cars increased 2.3 percent year-on-year to 265,441 units in October. This followed a 1.2 percent decrease in 
September.
Activity in the French manufacturing sector decreased for the twentieth consecutive month in October, and the rate 
of fall was faster than previously estimated, final data from a survey conducted by Markit Economics and CDAF 
showed Monday. The seasonally adjusted purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector dropped to 
49.1 in October from 49.8 in September. The flash estimates were for a score of 49.4.
The U.K. construction activity growth in October, surpassed August's recent peak, to log the steepest expansion in 
more than six years helped by residential building, survey results from Markit Economics showed Monday. The 
Markit/Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index for construction climbed to 59.4 
from 58.9 in September. The latest score was the highest since September 2007.
New orders for U.S. manufactured goods showed a notable increase in the month of September, according to a 
report released by the Commerce Department on Monday, with orders rebounding after showing an unexpected 
decrease in August.
The report said factory orders jumped by 1.7 percent in September after edging down by 0.1 percent in August. 
While the increase in orders in September matched economist estimates, orders had been expected to rise by 0.3 
percent in the previous month.

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) posted higher pre-tax profit of 685.4 
million euros in the first half, compared with 679.3 million euros last year. After tax, half-yearly IFRS profit was 602 
million euros, a 1% increase from the prior year's 596 million euros, as the company's traffic grew by 2% to 49 
million passengers.
Six-month earnings per ordinary share were 41.85 euro cents, marginally higher than 41.20 euro cents reported a 
year back.
During the period, operating revenues from continuing operations rose to 3.25 billion euros, from 3.11 billion euros. 
Load factor was up 1% to 85% in the first half of the year. Revenue per passenger increased 2% due to a 22% rise 
in ancillary revenues; while unit costs went up 3% largely due to a 7% increase in fuel prices. The company said the 
2% drop in fares during the first half was impacted by one off events such as the timing of Easter, the summer 
heatwave in northern Europe, French ATC strikes in June, and weaker sterling.
Commenting on the outlook, the company said in a statement, "... the continuing fare and yield softness means that 
full year profits will be lower than previously guided (?570m to ?600m). We now expect the full year outturn to be 
between ?500m to ?520m due entirely to this lower fare environment."

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) Monday said profit for the first half of the 
year rose marginally, helped by increased traffic. However, the company cut its full year profit forecast, citing a fall 
in average prices. The stock tumbled over 11 percent in early morning trade.
Profit attributable to equity-holders of the parent advanced to 601.9 million euros ($812 million) from 595.6 million 
euros. Earnings per share advanced to 41.85 euro cents from 41.20 euro cents.
Pre-tax profit climbed to 685.4 million euros from 679.3 million euros last year.
Total operating revenues improved to 3.255 billion euros from 3.106 billion euros in the prior year.
Traffic grew 2 percent to 49 million passengers. Load factor was up 1 percentage point to 85 percent.
Revenue per passenger advanced 2 percent due to a 22 percent increase in ancillary revenues owing to the 
successful roll out of reserved seating, priority boarding and higher credit/debit card fees.
Unit costs increased 3 percent, largely due to a 7 percent increase in fuel prices. Excluding fuel, sector length 
adjusted unit costs fell 2 percent amid cost efficiencies.
Average fares fell 2 percent, impacted by one off events like the timing of Easter, the summer heatwave in northern 
Europe, French ATC strikes in June and weaker sterling. In response to these market conditions, Ryanair 
stimulated traffic growth with aggressive fare promotions. Average fares have continued to fall this winter, Ryanair 
noted.
Looking ahead, Ryanair said market pricing remains weak and it would continue to promote low fare seat sales 
throughout the remainder of the year. While forward bookings are running slightly ahead of last year, the softness in 
fares and yields continues.
Based on reasonable visibility, the company expects third-quarter fares to fall 9 percent, and fourth-quarter fares to 
fall by up to 10 percent. The cost discipline is expected to see sector length adjusted cost per passenger fall 7 
percent in the second half.
However, amid the continuing fare and yield softness, full year profits are expected to be lower than

the previous guidance of 570 million euros to 600 million euros. The airline now expect the full year out-turn to be 
between 500 million euros to 520 million euros due to this lower fare environment.
RYA.L fell 11.56 percent in early morning trade to 5.39 euros.

Highlight: Ryanair Ltd. has announced that it will open eight new routes from Shannon to Berlin, Faro, 
Fuerteventura, Krakow, Munich, Nice, Paris and Warsaw from April 2014.
Body
This growth is the first 300,000 of an extra 1m passengers p.a. that Ryanair will deliver at Irish airports in direct 
response to the Government's budget decision to scrap the E3 travel tax from April 2014. Ryanair's expansion at 
Shannon from April 2014 will deliver: 8 new routes to Berlin, Faro, Fuerteventura, Krakow, Munich, Nice, Paris & 
Warsaw; increased frequency on the Stansted route from 14 to 15 per week; 300,000 new Ryanair passengers p.a. 
(750,000 in total); 300 new on site jobs; and Shannon traffic will grow from 450,000 to 750,000 p.a. Ryanair is in 
continuing discussions with the four other main Irish airports - Cork, Dublin, Kerry and Knock - to finalise its growth 
plans for summer 2014 and hopes to announce more route and frequency growth from Ireland in the coming weeks. 
In Shannon, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said: "Ryanair is pleased to announce 8 new routes and increased 
frequency on the Stansted route from Shannon in April 2014, which will deliver 300,000 additional passengers p.a. 
and support 300 new on-site jobs at Shannon. This growth is in direct response to the Government's welcome 
decision to scrap the E3 air travel tax from April 2014. "The scrapping of the air travel tax will help restore Ireland's 
competitiveness and attractiveness to overseas visitors from the UK and Continental Europe in particular. 
Having met with all five of the main Irish airports, we hope to announce further new route and traffic growth plans 
over the coming weeks." Shannon Airport CEO, Neil Pakey said: "We are delighted that Ryanair have shown real 
commitment to the Shannon Region in announcing 8 new European routes for 2014, in addition to the 10 already 
served from Shannon. The timing of this announcement couldn't be better for inbound visitors in particular, given 
the focus next year on the Wild Atlantic Way and on Limerick as the City of Culture."

  Associated British Foods , the group behind Primark, could be on track to hit £1bn in adjusted profit before tax 
for the first time when it reports its full-year update, writes Duncan Robinson .
The shopping-and-sugar conglomerate has had a strong 2013 and should report double-digit earnings per share 
growth again, according to Davy analysts.
ABF said this year that operating profit in its second half would be ahead of expectations, thanks to improving 
performance at its fast fashion house.
Corporate Diary INTERNATIONAL/UK
Revenues at Primark have jumped by a third since 2010, although rising cotton costs and expansion into Europe 
have acted as a brake on profits.
Davy expects group revenues to rise 7.6 per cent to £13.2bn, with EPS up 12.4 per cent to 98p.
The sugar division will account for less than a third of group profits. ABF's grocery division, which includes Twinings 
tea, will account for about a fifth of the bottom line.
Meanwhile, Marks and Spencer is also expected to update the City, with Marc Bolland, chief executive, 
emphasising that although sales of clothing and homeware are still falling, the rate of decline is slowing. M&S is 
expected to announce a 12 per cent decline in pre-tax profit in the first half of its financial year, from £297m to 
£262m.
  Events last week underlined the need for a fresh strategy at G4S . Luckily, Ashley Almanza has one up his sleeve, 
writes Andy Sharman .
Shareholders will be keen to hear the chief executive's plans, which he will announce with a third-quarter trading 
update.
The outsourcing group last week turned down an approach from private equity group Charterhouse Capital, which 
offered £1.6bn for its cash solutions arm.
That came on the same day as uncomfortable allegations surfaced about the conduct of staff in a G4S prison in 
South Africa , which the company denies.
Mr Almanza is expected to outline the sale of non-core assets and a focus on emerging markets. Net debt is 
another area of concern, though a share placing over the summer eased the pressure.

  As the world's biggest temporary employment company, Adecco 's performance is inextricably linked to broader 
macroeconomic conditions, writes James Shotter .
In the three months to the end of June, revenues slipped 5 per cent year on year in the face of sluggish European 
markets.
Adecco managed a mild improvement in margins due to good cost control, and investors will be hoping to see it 
repeat the trick when it reports third-quarter figures.
They will also be hoping for signs of stabilisation in France. Adecco's biggest market provides 24 per cent of group 
revenues, but it has shrunk rapidly.

ArcelorMittal , the world's largest steelmaker by sales, is expected to report stronger third-quarter results than a 
year ago as its aggressive restructuring plans pay off, writes James Fontanella-Khan .
Underlying profits - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation - are forecast to increase to 
$1.55bn in the three months ending on September 30 from 1.3bn a year earlier, according to brokers polled by 
Vuma Financial Services, an independent research company.
Improving business sentiment across key industrial sectors in Europe during the summer is helping the steel 
industry overcome chronically low demand and overcapacity since the global financial crisis.
Although analysts are dubious that steel demand will rise almost 3 per cent next year, as forecast by the industry 
lobby Eurofer, they are confident that the worst is over for ArcelorMittal.
  Deutsche Telekom is expected to benefit from a good performance at its American operation, T-Mobile USA, 
which has introduced innovative pricing plans, writes Daniel Thomas .
However, the cost of gaining and retaining customers is likely to weigh on earnings and free cash flow at the US 
group, which the German company tried to sell a year ago.
Deutsche Telekom is expected to talk about a new operating model that will aim to improve integration of fixed and 
mobile networks around the provision of broadband services.
Analysts expect management to comment on the potential benefits of consolidation in a German market set to 
move from four operators to three given the proposed merger of rivals E Plus and O2.
Even before this potential boost to its domestic operations, Deutsche Telekom is expected to reveal a continued 
better performance in mobile than its rivals, with net additions of as many as 500,000 according to analysts at 
Berenberg. Service revenues are still forecast to decline 1.2 per cent, but this is expected to be better than rivals 
such as Vodafone in the country.

Ryanair shares dived, with other airline shares trailing in their wake, after the budget carrier warned investors that 
its profits would fall this year.
Bucking an overall upwards trend higher on European markets, Ryanair (RYA.L) slumped 11% to 5.43 after the 
Dublin-listed carrier told shareholders that net income would be between 500-520 million euros, which would be a 
fall from 569 million the previous year.
Easyjet (EZJ.L) dropped in chorus, down 2.8% to £12.60. International Consolidated Airlines (ICAG.L), the owner of 
British Airways, fell 2% to 346p.
The wider FTSE 100 was however trading up 0.4% to 6,761, helped by resources companies including ENRC, 
5.3% higher to 223p.
Investors were encouraged by more improved growth data from China, where the services Purchasing Managers' 
Index (or PMI, a survey of the private sector) showed an improvement to 56.3 in October from 55.4 the previous 
month. The report comes after data on Friday showed that the country's manufacturing activity rose to an 18-month 
high last month, raising hopes that the world's second largest economy will not suffer a prolonged economic 
slowdown.
Important economic updates are due in both the US with the publication of unemployment datae on Friday and 
Europe this week, providing tests for market appetite after October's strong equity rally.
Investors are looking ahead to the European Central Bank's monthly meeting, which concludes in Frankfurt on 
Thursday amid raised expectations that weaker recent data will prompt a loosening of monetary policy.

European shares rose today, with sentiment buoyed by increased expectations the European Central Bank will 
strike an equities-friendly dovish tone at a policy meeting this week.
That follows a surprise drop in euro zone inflation to 0.7 percent in the year to October, well below the ECB's target 
of just under 2 percent. Both UBS and RBS expect a rate cut at Thursday's meeting.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was 0.4 percent higher at 1,295.06 points to trade near last-week's 5-
year high. The index is up about 14 percent so far this year.
Europe's largest airline, Ryanair, fell 9 percent after saying its annual profit was set to fall for the first time in five 
years as intense competition pushes average fares down by around 10 percent over the winter months. Easyjet fell 
5 percent. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, more than half of the STOXX Europe 600 companies have 
reported results so far, of which 47 percent have met or beaten expectations, against 58 percent in the full second 
quarter and 52 percent in the January-March period. ( C ) Reuters

Globehook.com
**What it does:**online recruitment site.
**Why it works:**Keep your options open in terms of investment. Keep going with it, but don't let it preoccupy your 
time. Your job is to build a business. Sometimes you can get distracted working on that side of it, but when you 
concentrate on the business, the investors come.'' **Margaret Townsend**, chief executive and co-founder.
.....
Kerry start-up Globehook.com is intent on revolutionising recruitment with a new cloud-based job site that promises 
accurate matches for employers with jobs and candidates seeking work.
The idea behind the site, according to founder and ceo Margaret Townsend, is to overcome the hurdles associated 
with ''crude and generic'' online recruitment approaches to filling vacancies.
Globehook.com is designed to match job-seeker profiles with the specifications of the employer's job.
More than EUR 200,000 has so far been invested in the business, including private funding and grant aid from the 
Kerry Enterprise Board. Globehook, based in Tralee, has also secured Enterprise Ireland designation as a High 
Potential Start-up.
''Keep your options open in terms of investment,'' said Townsend. ''Keep going with it, but don't let it preoccupy your 
time. Your job is to build a business. Sometimes you can get distracted working on that side of it, but when you 
concentrate on the business, the investors come.''
Hooking up jobs in the cloud
Townsend came up with the concept for the site in 2012 and decided to partner with Keith Sheehan, her former 
boss at Glas Weld Ireland, and Dublin-based Continuum Technologies, to develop the site over 12 months before 
launching in June.
''I recognised that the existing online recruitment options are crude and ultimately unsuccessful, forcing employers 
to return to the expense of recruitment agencies or in-house HR processes,'' said Townsend.
''For an employer, the job seeker will always have the potential to be one of their greatest assets.
For the candidate, they need to be treated with respect and not as a commodity.
''When I was hiring people myself, I found that everybody I interviewed said to me `I've applied for hundreds of jobs 
and I haven't had one reply'. It's demoralising, so the fact that candidates get a reply when they apply for a job is 
one of the key features of Globehook.''
Globehook is currently recruiting for a business development manager and social media manager, and Townsend 
expects to create 19 additional jobs in the next 18 months.
The Globehook site is built on .Net and MS SQL platform with an algorithm running in the background to match the 
available jobs with applicants. It is hosted in the cloud by Ownwebnow supported by NTES in Limerick.
Companies registered on the site include Ryanair, Ergo, Terminalfour, Premier Inn Hotels, LotusWorks, Sentenial, 
Intelligent Partners and Aris Global.
''People are hearing about it and approaching us, but it is a matter of explaining that this is a bespoke platform for 
recruitment. It's not just trying to get in on the recruitment thing. It's a whole new idea,'' said Townsend.
''A lot of people say to us What about LinkedIn?' We're not anything like that.''
As a first-time entrepreneur, Townsend opted to partner with Sheehan, her former boss, at an early stage. The 
experience he brought to the table was, she said, invaluable in helping to get the business off the ground.
''This is my first start-up, so when I came up with the concept, I wanted to work with somebody who was very good 
at what they did and had different skills that would complement mine,'' she said.
''I took a chance on saying it to Keith, because I didn't know if he would really be into it, but he has a very technical 
background.
He used to work with Analog Devices and he won awards for a college project.''
Having the involvement of both a man and a woman in developing the company, was proving beneficial in itself, 
Townsend said.
''Some women, when they're in business, want to work with another woman, but having both a man and a woman 
on our team has really opened things up for us a lot more in a lot of ways, because we both bring different things to 
the table.
Sometimes, customers or investors would rather speak to a man or a woman, so the diversity works.''

I flew from Scotland to London with my children on Thursday. Everyone was in a remarkably good mood - possibly 
because they were either flying on or working for British Airways rather than Ryanair - and the captain asked us in 
to see the flight deck. It went well. No one pressed any buttons they weren't supposed to and everyone was polite 
to the pilots. But I was not altogether thrilled to be reminded just how complicated a cockpit is - so many buttons, so 
much risk.
Thank goodness, I thought, that I work in a relatively simple business. Then I dropped the children off and went to 
the Sohn Conference , where I was reminded why so many people think finance is more complicated than flying a 
plane.
The Sohn is an annual event, once US-only but now in the UK, at which the super well paid of the UK get to show 
their compassionate side. The conference is designed to raise money for the treatment and cure of paediatric 
cancer. The tickets cost £1,000 each and everyone who is anyone in hedge fund land straps on their most 
expensive status symbol - a ludicrous luxury watch in most cases, an "I've visited the flight deck" sticker in mine - 
and heads off to be seen.
The lure is not the charity itself but that a series of well known and successful fund managers take to the podium to 
tell you which stocks they love and which they hate . Much of it was complicated and one or two of the interesting 
ideas might not work for ordinary investors. But here is a few of the simple and interesting ones. First, Julian 
Sinclair of Talisman Global Asset Management, who like most of the managers was advertised as a contrarian 
Hedge fund wisdom is cut to the bone Investing
investor. He tipped Tata Motors on the basis that some 80 per cent of its value is made up of Jaguar Land Rover. 
He figures the brand value of that business alone is $17bn - not much less than the entire market cap of Tata. Look 
at it like that and the current price gives you the luxury car business very cheaply, particularly given that there is 
scope for profit margin expansion and that the firm is just coming to the end of an expensive cycle of investment - 
so its cash flow should now improve dramatically. In effect you get the Indian commercial vehicle business that 
makes up the rest of the company for free, which sounds nice.
Also telling a simple story was Chris Hohn. If you have read anything about the head of the sweetly named 
Children's Investment Fund you will know that he is the largest investor in the Royal Mail apart from the UK 
government. That was a good call (for him if not the taxpayer ) - the shares are up around 60 per cent or more since 
the IPO. Mr Hohn loves privatisations. "Governments are just about the worst owners of companies you can find," 
he reminded us. When companies move into private hands, they always transform and offer their investors "huge 
financial upside".
So he tipped Australian railway company Aurizon. He got the largest allocation of stock in this from the state when it 
was sold off in 2010 and it "continues transformation" thanks to contract repricing, the "releveraging of the 
company" and the "voluntary and involuntary" departure of thousands of employees.
Mr Hohn also tipped EADS, maker of Airbus airliners. It is also recently privatised , is cheap and has huge potential 
in a duopoly business with firm barriers to entry. Other convincing tips from speakers included credit rating 
company Experian (strong growth, a beneficiary of "big data" and again a business with almost insurmountable 
barriers to entry); Sampo, owner of 21 per cent of Nordea, the leading Scandinavian banking franchise; and one of 
my favourites, oil distribution services group DCC, which is successfully consolidating a fragmented industry with 
lots of acquisitions. However, I know that some of you like to buy markets and not individual stocks.
Good news then, in that I think the most gripping talk of the day came from Andrew Weiss of Weiss Asset 
Management. He told us to buy Korea. You have heard this before - David Stevenson wrote about it in Adventurous 
Investor in May - but to reappraise: amazing infrastructure, fantastic education system and lots of potential cheap 
labour from enterprise zones bordering North Korea.
Of course, rapid economic growth is entirely irrelevant to stock market returns: high levels of investment and low 
levels of regard for shareholders mean that high growth economies almost always have low growth stock markets. 
So what might make Korea different? First it is not starting from too high a price; second, much of the investment is 
done; and third, there are huge changes to corporate governance under way. If regulations on the way through now 
pass, South Korea will soon have the "best shareholder rights in the world".
You can buy into this story in a complicated way - getting what Mr Weiss calls a "double discount" by picking up 
ultra-cheap preference shares (Hyundai's are trading on a p/e of 3.1 times) - or a potentially less lucrative but 
simpler way with a Korean exchange traded fund . I will be acting on some of the tips from the conference myself in 
the next few weeks, but if you want an even simpler takeaway from the Sohn conference it is this: register to 
become a bone marrow donor . A short talk explained that it does not take that long and if you turn out to be a 
match for someone it will show your compassionate side even more than paying £1,000 to attend a conference.

Budget airline Ryanair has no plans to radically overhaul the way it is managed and has already unveiled most of 
the promised customer service improvements in an effort to improve its image, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary 
told Reuters today.
The charismatic but often outspoken O'Leary has said he wants to overhaul an "abrupt culture" at Europe's biggest 
airline, famous for its no-frills service and extra charges that have annoyed many flyers.
Having said in September he took responsibility for the impact of "personal character deformities" on how the 
company was managed, O'Leary now says that comment was tongue in cheek.
The revamp, he said, would not go significantly beyond the overhaul of its website and a series of fee cuts 
announced in recent weeks. "There's no grand transformation," said O'Leary, who has been regularly accused of 
treating customers, staff and regulators in an abrasive manner. "I don't understand why ... there is this kind of 
impression we have had some Pauline conversion here to customer service," he said, referring to commentators 
comparing his comments at Ryanair's annual meeting with the biblical conversion of St. Paul on the road to 
Damascus. "We have always had brilliant customer service." Since the AGM, Ryanair has addressed major gripes 
by halving the cost of checking bags, slashing the fee for reprinting boarding passes and allowing a small second 
carry-on bag for free. It also rolled out a major overhaul of its website to cut pop-ups and a security puzzle that 
customers had to complete to prove they were not automated users trawling the site. The airline has since started 
legal action against a pilot group fighting for union recognition, the latest in a stream of court cases that have also 
targeted media and regulators. When asked if the drive to become nicer might include fewer court cases and better 
treatment of staff, O'Leary rejected the idea that Ryanair needed to change. "We've always been nicer," he said. 
"We've always offered people lower fares than any other airline." On Monday Ryanair is due to announce first-half 
Ryanair Doesn't Need to Change says Boss Ryanair Changes
results after saying in September it would miss its annual profit target, its first profit warning in a decade. O'Leary 
said some people appeared, however, to be underestimating a series of cost reductions on profitability, including 
expected falls in fuel prices and deals with London's Stansted Airport and Warsaw's Modlin. A company poll of 
analysts is forecasting a profit of Eur605 million in the six months to September. (Reuters)

Alan Gilsenan, the award-winning film maker and documentary maker is director of the new documentary Pioneers 
and Aviators "" A Century of Irish Aviation.
Commissioned by Avolon, the film will be premiering at The National Concert Hall in Dublin exclusively to delegates 
of the 16th Annual Airfinance Conference. 
I sat down with Alan to find out more about the film and was surprised to hear about the key role Ireland has had, 
and continues to have in this sector.
Alan Gilsenan: [Pioneers and Aviators] tells the story of Irish Aviation in the very early days to the industry today, 
which you may know well about but I certainly didn't.
Even as someone who's Irish and takes an interest in all things Irish, I was amazed when I actually realised how 
substantial the Irish aviation business is today.
How important the leasing industry is here, for a small country, particularly at the moment, having had the difficulties 
we've had"¦ it's an extraordinary story.
I think what's very interesting is that you can see that in any country history is a succession of intertwining steps. 
Actually, very small things back in the 1930s and 1940s led to where we are today. None of the contemporary 
industries just land out of nothing. We've been tracing the weave of history. 
Pioneers and Aviators - An interview with director Alan Gilsenan
I was interested in the early days of Irish history, around the uprising of 1916 and the upheaval that led to 
independence. Famous revolutionary figures in Irish life like Michael Collins had an interest in flight. 
Even in their negotiations with the British Government, the Irish delegation seemed to be very aware of the 
importance of aviation, more so than their British counterparts who were perhaps more concerned with the sea.
When the Anglo-Irish treaties happened in London, [the nascent Irish government] purchased a plane so they could 
get Michael Collins, the revolutionary hero, out of London if it all went pear-shaped.
In the wake of the second world war, at the Chicago aviation convention in 1945, the Irish Government struck a deal 
that all American planes travelling to Europe across the Atlantic would land in Shannon, which of course had a huge 
impact on the future of Shannon, that part of Ireland and on aviation.
Those were the kinds of visionary steps taken by various politicians and civil servants at the time, when really, not 
that many Irish people were thinking of aviation as a future industry.
Added to that, when you move up through the story, the charismatic and dynamic figure of Tony Ryan. He was the 
founder of Ryanair and in many ways the founding father of all of the leasing companies that have emerged out of 
the implosion of GPA in 1992. He's obviously a fascinating man in many respects, and he is the trailblazer for Irish 
aviation, leasing and finance.
It could be argued that in a way the failure of GPA at that time led to the impetus, the catalyst, for all the people that 
went out into the world of aviation leasing, founded their own companies and sowed the seeds of success today.
The other element to this story of course, is Aer Lingus. There's a great romance - even when I was a boy, Irish 
people would go to the airport for a day out. You know we are very proud of Aer Lingus, which is seen as our 
trailblazer, our standard-bearer of the country.
Of course Aer Lingus hit problems like many national airlines across the globe, but somehow I think the competition 
with Ryanair has resulted in us having two fairly serious airlines based here in Ireland, holding their own.
In the 1950s and 1960s, [Aer Lingus] attracted all the bright, smart, technically adept people in the country. As I 
traced the story of Irish aviation, you'll find that a lot of the key people, including the current CEO of BA/Iberia etc 
came out of Aer Lingus.
I think that's very interesting that you can trace the roots "" you know you have the Irish CEO of Qantas, Emirates, 
leasing companies across the globe"¦ there is a considerable presence around the world, which certainly to most 
Irish people had probably gone unnoticed.
We had extraordinary cooperation from people in the industry, people who are due to the nature of the job are 
hugely busy, there are a lot of very revealing interviews and unseen archives. I was particularly struck how Irish 
people and other people from the industry like Boeing's CEO Ray Connor made time to contribute to the story. 
Pioneers and Aviators - An interview with director Alan Gilsenan
I think people were very frank "" it's certainly not a puff piece for Irish aviation. There were great ups but there were 
also downs along the way "" I hope it's considered a serious look at Irish aviation, not just Irish aviation for Irish 
people but the role of Irish aviation in the world.
Alan Gilsenan is an award-winning film-maker, writer and theatre director. His work has appeared in the cinema and 
on the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, RT, PBS, SBS Australia, and the History Channel amongst others.
The world premiere of Pioneers and Aviators will be accompanied by an original music score by renowned 
composer and pianist Mchel Silleabhin working with the RT Concert Orchestra.
This event will take place in the National Concert Hall, Dublin on Wednesday 22nd January 2014 from 18:45 to 
20.45. Capacity is limited and tickets are offered on a first-come first-served basis exclusively to registered 
delegates of the 16th Annual Global Airfinance Conference Dublin.

From Mr William Maunder Taylor.
Sir, It was good to read that Ryanair is taking steps to become more customer friendly (" Ryanair launches 
customer charm offensive in bid to shed PR baggage ", October 26), but is it too little, too late? I associate the 
airline with the story of its chief executive and the Dublin barman.
Feeling thirsty, Michael O'Leary goes into a bar and asks the price of a pint of Guinness. He is told it costs EUR4.
"That is a good price and in that case I should like a pint please," he replies.
"Very good," says the barman. "Now would you be wanting a glass as well?"

Ryanair has today announced 3 new routes from Knock Airport, as well as increased frequencies on its Knock-
London route in response to the Government's decision to scrap the Eur3 travel tax.
The new routes to Eindhoven, Glasgow Prestwick & Kaunas and extended London service are expected to deliver 
an additional 80,000 passengers per annum and support 80 new on-site jobs at Knock Airport. The routes will begin 
in April 2014 and will be available on the Ryanair website from tomorrow.
Following successful negotiations with Knock and Shannon, Ryanair is finalising its discussions with the other main 
Irish airports - Cork, Dublin and Kerry- to finalise its growth plans for summer 2014, with a view to further route and 
frequency growth announcements in the coming weeks, which will see the airline delivering an expected 1million 
extra passengers in total.
Ryanair's Michael Cawley said: "Ryanair is pleased to announce 3 new routes and increased frequencies on its 
London route from Knock from April 2014, which will deliver 80,000 new passengers per annum and support up to 
80 new on-site jobs at Knock. This growth is in direct response to the Government's very welcome decision to scrap 
the Eur3 air travel tax from April 2014. "The scrapping of the travel tax will help restore Ireland's competitiveness 
and attractiveness to overseas visitors from the UK and Continental Europe in particular. Having met with all five of 
the main Irish airports, and announced new growth for 2014 at Shannon and Knock, we hope to announce further 
new route and traffic growth plans over the coming weeks. Minister of State for Tourism & Sport Michael Ring has 
said the new Ryanair services from Knock Airport announced today are the second significant announcement from 
the Eur0 Travel Tax launched in Budget 2014. Minister Ring said: "This is further evidence that Budget 2014 was 
good for tourism and good for aviation. I'm delighted to welcome the announcement by Ryanair today to introduce 
new UK and European services at Ireland West Airport Knock. "I will work with the team in Tourism Ireland to 
ensure we do all we can to promote these new services overseas and to help ensure these routes are a success for

the west and north west regions and bring a much needed boost to the tourist industry in these regions. "These 
flights are also a real boost to the Wild Atlantic Way, the west coast tourism route which will be fully up and running 
next year. Eindhoven Airport in particular is the ideal location for visitors from the Netherlands, Belgium, 
Luxembourg and western Germany. This is the first route of its kind from those countries, all of which have a strong 
affinity with the west of Ireland. Niall Gibbons, chief executive of Tourism Ireland, said: "Today's announcement is 
wonderful news for tourism to Mayo and the West of Ireland. We already work very closely with Ryanair and we 
look forward to co-operating with them to maximise the promotion of these new flights from Britain and the 
Netherlands to Knock. As an island, the importance of convenient, direct, non-stop flights cannot be overstated - 
they are absolutely critical to achieving growth in inbound tourism. Tourism Ireland is committed to working with 
Ryanair, Ireland West Airport Knock and other tourism interests, through co-operative marketing, to drive demand 
for these flights to Knock - as we work with other carriers and partners to promote and help maintain vital routes 
and services to the island. "Tourism from Mainland Europe is performing well this year - over +5pc for the January-
September period, with good increases in visitor numbers from the Benelux countries. We are also pleased to see a 
return in growth to visitor numbers from GB this year - including +9pc for the peak summer months (July-
September). And the outlook for 2014 is also positive - particularly in light of these new Ryanair flights, just in time 
for the summer season, which will help keep the growth momentum going.

September period, with good increases in visitor numbers from the Benelux countries. We are also pleased to see a 
return in growth to visitor numbers from GB this year - including +9pc for the peak summer months (July-
September). And the outlook for 2014 is also positive - particularly in light of these new Ryanair flights, just in time 
for the summer season, which will help keep the growth momentum going.

Today Lufthansa warned that weakness in Asian currencies would weigh on revenue growth at its passenger airline 
business this year and that a grindingly slow market recovery was set to dent profit at its cargo unit.
The German flag carrier said the weak Japanese yen and Indian rupee in particular weighed on third-quarter 
revenues at the passenger division, its biggest business. The yen has fallen about 33pc against the euro since late 
last year, while the Indian rupee has fallen by about 24pc year-on-year as of end-September.
"The Passenger Airline Group is now forecasting for 2013 a revenue on par with previous year," the group said. The 
previous forecast had been for a moderate increase in revenue.
Lufthansa, however, stuck to a stronger operating profit outlook at the passenger division, pinning its hopes on its 
SCORE restructuring programme, which helped cut costs by 0.9pc over the last nine months when sales growth 
was flat. Other European airlines such as Ryanair and Finnair have trimmed profit expectations, citing lower 
demand and the impact of volatile exchange rates, while Air France-KLM said the sharp rise in the Euro against the 
dollar had weighed on quarterly revenue. The German carrier said that while advanced bookings were slightly up on 
the year in terms of volumes, the negative trend in exchange rates would persist. Lufthansa is in its second year of 
a radical restructuring programme, aiming to boost operating profit to Eur2.3 billion, up 1.5bn from 2011. The 
revamp includes 3,500 job cuts, the expansion of discount unit Germanwings, as well as outsourcing and 
procurement bundling. Lufthansa Cargo, where nine-month operating profit dropped 35 percent to Eur43 million, will 
see earnings fall again, despite early signs of market recovery for the fourth quarter. The company no longer 
expects to be able last years figures and now expects to close the year in the high double-digit million Euro range. It 
had previously estimated this year's cargo profit would be higher than last year's Eur104 million. Air France said low 
growth and high oil prices meant medium-haul and cargo activities will see a "significant reduction" in losses in

2014, without enabling them to break even as first hoped. Lufthansa Finance director Simone Menne said that while 
a cargo upswing was absent in January to September, there are signs now that cargo's pre-Christmas business

The ISEQ rose modestly this morning thanks to a lift in Glanbia stocks after its latest interim management 
statement.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 10.20 points to 4,336.16.
Irish global performance nutrition and ingredients group, Glanbia, updated the market this morning in an interim 
statement, reporting revenue growth of 14 per cent in the nine months to October 5th. Its Irish dairy division remains 
"challenging" however with a rationalisation programme in place to improve competitiveness. Total group revenue 
grew 14 per cent in the nine months, comprising approximately 9 per cent volume growth and 5 per cent price 
growth with the impact of acquisitions and disposals largely offsetting one another. John Moloney, group managing 
director said that the group had "performed well" in the first nine months of 2013. Glanbia's stocks rose 47c to 
E10.07.
Shares in Ryanair climbed 4c to E6.10. Ryanair reports Q2 results on Monday November 4th. "We expect the 
business to be performing as expected and assume H1 net profit of E604m, including E525.9m in the peak Q2, up 
c.6pc year-on-year (yoy). We expect FY2014 guidance to be maintained at the lower end of the E570-600m range 
(Davy E575m; consensus E581m). Ryanair continues to put in place the building blocks for growth (long-term deals 
put in place at Stansted, Warsaw, growth in Ireland) and customer service improvements. Given recent currency 
movements (dollar /E), this should be particularly beneficial for FY2015 as a hedging programme is built out. Cash 
generation will allow for returns to shareholders to continue," said Davy.

Ryanair launches customer charm offensive in bid to shed PR baggage
Ryanair launches customer charm offensive in bid to shed PR baggage

Flying Ryanair has long been considered a pursuit for masochists.
Famous for chaotic queueing, abrasive staff and a relentless barrage of loud advertising, the company has a 
reputation for poor customer service that its combative boss Michael O'Leary appears to revel in. There have been 
no apologies for those with the audacity to complain.
But following a series of public relations disasters and investor concern that Ryanair's policies are deterring 
customers, the company has taken the first steps to cast off its image as the nasty airline.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier yesterday announced an effort to improve its customer service and tempt business 
travellers in a shift that mimics some of the changes made by rival easyJet.   The company is to relax the 
aggressive baggage checks that force stressed passengers to squeeze duty-free purchases and handbags into 
their carry-on cases, instead allowing them to bring a second small bag on board.
Customers will be able to amend booking errors during a 24-hour grace period while the charge for reissuing 
boarding passes is to be slashed from £70 to £15. The standard fee   for checking in a bag will be halved to £30.
The airline is also introducing "quiet flights" on early morning and late departures; before 8am and after 9pm there 
will be no PA announcements advertising scratch cards or smokeless cigarettes. It is decommissioning the high-
pitched "bugle" that is played when a flight lands on time.
Ryanair launches customer charm offensive in bid to shed PR baggage
Ryanair's focus on customer service represents a big shift in strategy for the airline, which has achieved rapid 
growth by providing flights with zero frills at low cost.
It follows a profit warning issued by Ryanair last month and relentless media coverage about its poor customer 
service.
In a Twitter chat yesterday, Mr O'Leary showed that he had not lost his sense of humour despite the airline's 
attempt to change its image. When asked what Ryanair would look like in 10 years' time, he responded: "Twice the 
size [200m customers], half the prices, all the customers bust, [and] me retired in the funny farm."
The U-turn follows concerns from investors that were addressed by Mr O'Leary at the annual general meeting last 
month. "We should try and eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off," he said at the time.
"The moves by Ryanair stem from a realisation that in order to fill Europe's largest fleet, customer service will be of 
growing importance for the airline," said David Holohan, analyst with Dublin-based Merrion Stockbrokers.
"As easyJet has done well targeting a wider variety of passengers, Ryanair needed to adapt its offering to compete 
more successfully and this is a good start."

It is to cut its baggage fees and the charges for reissuing boarding cards and will allow passengers to carry 
handbags or duty-free shopping bags on board as well as a piece of hand luggage.
The airline is able to keep fares low by charging passengers for a host of services, but it and rivals have come in for 
heavy criticism from consumer groups for high fees for correcting errors and putting bags in the hold. It has been 
inviting feedback on its service on its website and said the changes are a reaction to this.
December will see the boarding card reissue fee cut from E70 to E15 for customers who have already checked in 
online. However, customers who fail to check-in online will continue to pay a E70 airport check-in fee. From the 
beginning of next year, standard airport bag fees will be cut from E60 to E30 at the bag drop-in desk and from E60 
to E50 at the boarding gate. Ryanair, which plays a fanfare on board any flight that arrives at its destination on time, 
said it will also operate quiet flights between 9 pm and 8 am, with no announcements other than the required safety 
announcements and dimmed lights so passengers can sleep if they wish to. "As some of these policy changes will 
require website changes and handling staff retraining, we will be rolling them out over the next few months," 
Customer Service Director Caroline Green said in a statement.

Body
The introduction of eight Ryanair routes out of Shannon for next year "is the start of much more of Ryanair at 
Shannon", according to the deputy chief executive of Ryanair, Michael Cawley.
He was in Shannon yesterday to announce almost a doubling of Ryanair passengers through Shannon next year, 
from 450,000 to 750,000.
The deal alone represents passenger growth of almost 15 per cent at Shannon next year. "We are here to stay and 
we are here to grow," Mr Cawley said, "and we will take it one step at a time. I don't see any impediment to Ryanair 
expansion here and further expansion on that top of that."
Mr Cawley said the Government abolition of the travel tax was "critical" in the deal Ryanair has made with Shannon 
to fly the routes to Berlin, Paris, Fuerteventura, Warsaw, Faro, Munich, Nice and Krakow. The number of Ryanair 
routes out of Shannon next year will increase to 18. The Irish Times XXXX AER Lingus is inflicting "wanton 
destruction" on the lives of 87 of its workers as the airline closes its cabin crew base at Shannon, trade union 
Impact has claimed. The airline confirmed yesterday that from March next year, it would no longer base cabin crew 
at Shannon. The decision stems from a labour dispute over staffing arrangements for new Aer Lingus transatlantic 
services that are set to begin next year and will be using a smaller Boeing 757 aircraft. The carrier is doubling its 
US-bound frequency from Shannon, as well as inaugurating new services from Dublin to San Francisco and 
Toronto. The Irish Independent XXXX Should we go it alone after December 15, or should we apply for a 
precautionary credit line to give us that extra bit of insurance as we move from bailout to full-time access to the 
global money markets? Finance Minister Michael Noonan is in a series of international meetings involving the 
troika, to gauge our best exit options. If we were to take an overdraft facility, the Government hopes that we will 
never have to use it and it will simply be a safety net. But as the old cliche goes, the devil is in the detail, and the 
fine print of any credit line needs to be examined closely by the Government. The Irish Independent XXXX The new

CITY slickers rubbed shoulders with celebrities yesterday lunchtime at the inaugural London Irish Business Awards 
ceremony, held at the London Stock Exchange.
Organised by Ireland Inc, a private sector body set up to advance Irish business interests, the gathering handed out 
gongs to corporates and individuals it considered to have made an outstanding contribution to the interests of 
British and Irish trade.
The group was responsible for the LSE's Ireland Day earlier this year, which saw Ireland INC founder Ian Hyland 
ring the bell.
London-listed Greencore's Patrick Coveney won business person of the year for his leadership of the convenience 
food company behind Weightwatchers ready meals.
Meanwhile Gary McCann was on hand to pick up a prize on behalf of Smurfit Kappa, the global packaging group, 
for London Irish business of the year.
Honours were also bestowed upon former British ambassador to Ireland, Julian King CMG, honoured for his 
outstanding contribution to British Irish trade relations, and the Irish International Business Network.
There were no prizes for Ryanair or Aer Lingus this time round and no mention of Betfair and Paddy-Power.
But if yesterday's event is anything to go by, The Capitalist wouldn't mind placing a bet that the London Irish 
Business Awards are set to take off.

(RTTNews) - Irish airline Ryanair Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY), Friday said that the 'Recaptcha' security code will be 
removed from the Ryanair.com website for individual bookings next week, as part of their customer service 
improvements.
From November 1, the customers who book directly through the Ryanair.com website, without the help of travel 
agents or screenscrapers, can correct any minor errors made in their booking, within a day. Ryanair will also 
operate 'quiet flights', before 8am and after 9pm, with effect from November 1.
From December 1, Ryanair will allow passengers to bring a 2nd small carry-on bag, and the boarding card reissue 
fee will be cut from 70 pounds to 15 pounds for customers who have already checked in online. With respect from 
January 1, Ryanair's standard airport bag fees will be reduced to 50 pounds, from 60 pounds at the boarding gate.

Ryanair today announced it will open 8 new routes from Shannon to Berlin, Faro, Fuerteventura, Krakow, Munich, 
Nice, Paris and Warsaw from April 2014.
It said that the expansion will deliver an additional 300,000 passengers a year and support 300 new on-site jobs at 
Shannon.
This growth is the first 300,000 of an extra million passengers a year that Ryanair will deliver at Irish airports in 
direct response to the Government's budget decision to scrap the E3 travel tax from April 2014, it said.
Its Shannon traffic will grow from 450,000 to 750,000 a year, it said. Ryanair is in continuing discussions with the 
four other main Irish airports - Cork, Dublin, Kerry and Knock - to finalise its growth plans for summer 2014 and 
hopes to announce more route and frequency growth from Ireland in the coming weeks. In Shannon, Ryanair's 
Michael Cawley said: "Ryanair is pleased to announce 8 new routes and increased frequency on the Stansted route 
from Shannon in April 2014, which will deliver 300,000 additional passengers p.a. and support 300 new on-site jobs 
at Shannon. This growth is in direct response to the Government's welcome decision to scrap the E3 air travel tax 
from April 2014. The scrapping of the air travel tax will help restore Ireland's competitiveness and attractiveness to 
overseas visitors from the UK and Continental Europe in particular. Having met with all five of the main Irish 
airports, we hope to announce further new route and traffic growth plans over the coming weeks."

(RTTNews) - Irish airline Ryanair Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) Thursday said it would open 8 new routes from Shannon to 
Berlin, Faro, Fuerteventura, Krakow, Munich, Nice, Paris and Warsaw from April 2014.
These new routes will deliver an additional 300,000 passengers annually and support 300 new on-site jobs at 
Shannon.
This growth is the first 300,000 of an extra 1 million passengers per annum that Ryanair will deliver at Irish airports 
in response to the Government's budget decision to scrap the 3 euros travel tax from April 2014.
The new routes will go on sale on the Ryanair.com website on Friday.

Body
Ireland has an "exceptional claim" to have its banks recapitalised by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the 
euro-zone bailout fund, according to Citigroup chief economist Willem Buiter.
"The Irish sovereign has on its books at least E30 billion - possibly up to E60 billion - worth of debt that is only there 
because Ireland was cajoled [and] forced into taking one for the team," he said yesterday at an Irish Life pension 
conference in Convention Centre Dublin.
Mr Buiter said that in 2010 the Government wanted to "bail-in" Anglo-Irish Bank, forcing the bank's creditors, 
including senior bondholders, to absorb some of the lender's losses by having part of the debt they were owed 
written off. However, Mr Buiter said Ireland was urged not to do so by Germany, the United States and the then 
head of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet.
"I think Europe owes Ireland somewhere between E30 and E60 billion," he said, adding that he hoped the continent 
would "cough up".
The Irish Times XXXX The National Management Agency is continuing to collect rent arrears from debtors 
connected with Irish Bank Resolution Corporation as a result of the Government's decision to liquidate the bank in 
February of this year. Before February, Nama had outsourced to IBRC the management of loans with a face value 
of E38 billion and loans to more than 300 debtors totalling about E1.3 billion. In its annual statement for 2014, which 
was submitted to the minister for finance Michael Noonan in September and made public last night, Nama said that 
it had "experienced an unexpected disruption" to its cash collection activities from IBRC following the dramatic 
liquidation of the bank. "The bank and loan accounts of IBRC were frozen by the Central Bank and standing orders 
were blocked," Nama's report to the minister states. "Work is ongoing in respect of putting in place new rental 
payment structures in new banks and the collection of any outstanding cash due to Nama." The Irish Times XXXX

Declan Ryan, the son of Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, attributed the success of the low-cost Mexican airline 
VivaAerobus backed by his family to their partners in the venture, Mexican bus company Iamsa. Mr Ryan described 
the company, which carries 300 million passengers on 10,000 buses a year, as the "perfect partner" for 
VivaAerobus, in which the family's Irelandia investment vehicle is a shareholder. VivaAerobus has just ordered 52 
Airbus aircraft from the European company in the biggest ever order of aircraft by a single airline in Latin America. 
The airline operates 19 Boeing aircraft. "We are up to about four and a half, five million passengers a year. The new 
aircraft will make a big difference," Mr Ryan said, in a rare public comment. The aviation entrepreneur was 
speaking at a reception hosted by Irish ambassador to Mexico Sonya Hyland for the visit of President Michael D 
Higgins to Mexico on his visit to Latin America. The Irish Times XXXX Kerry-based finance group Fexco has signed 
a deal to buy an expanding mobile payments and loyalty cards business. The Irish company is understood to have 
paid between E3m and E5m to acquire a majority stake in FLASHiZ. The Luxembourg-based firm's mobile phone 
payments technology is in use at around 500 outlets across Europe after it was set up in 2011. French banking 
giant BNP Paribas's Personal Finance arm is taking a minority stake in the company. No jobs here will be lost as a 
result of the takeover, while the FLASHiZ team will be retained after the deal The Irish Independent XXXX 
December 15 might be 10 days before Christmas, but we bet the champagne corks will be popping in Finance 
Minister Michael Noonan's house on that day. The much-heralded date is stamped in the minds of business 
journalists all over the country. It will soon take its place in Irish history books - the day Ireland formally exits the 
E85bn bailout (though for administrative purposes, the EU sign-off will come in early January). At the height of the 
eurozone debt crisis in July 2011, it looked as though this day might never come. Default loomed. The country's 
credit rating had been cut to junk and borrowing costs were hiked to an eye-watering 15pc. The Irish Independent

ONE MONTH ago, Ryanair shocked the airline industry by revealing it was going to start being nicer to customers. 
Our research at the time found that, while French and German customers had a fairly dim view of the discount 
carrier, its reputation was worse in Britain.
Well, one month into its new customer service strategy and the preliminary signs appear to show that - drumroll, 
please - it's working. Ryanair's UK Buzz score, which measures what consumers are hearing about the brand, is up 
five points, going from minus 33.6 to minus 28.7. This still means people are hearing more bad than good about 
Ryanair, but it is a big improvement, particularly in such a short period of time. Also, the number of British 
consumers who say they would consider flying Ryanair has risen from 13 per cent to 15 per cent. The percentage 
of people who say they will buy Ryanair tickets has also modestly increased, from 3.4 per cent to 4.4 per cent.
While there are certainly some encouraging signs for the brand, it is still very far away from changing - in the words 
of bombastic chief executive Michael O'Leary - the "macho and abrupt culture" for which it is known.
Part of the company's new strategy has been to embrace social media. On Monday, O'Leary donned a green 
leprechaun hat and fake beard to take part in a live discussion on Twitter.
According to our analysis, 16 per cent of UK users heard about the brand, up from just one per cent the day before. 
However, the activity was largely generated by media outlets with a high number of followers.And while the airline 
has improved its image in Britain, our data shows Ryanair's warmer and fuzzier approach has yet to melt hearts in 
France and Germany.
