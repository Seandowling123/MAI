INVESTORS will be on the lookout for news of increased capacity on Easyjet routes as the low-cost airline reveals 
its first quarter results this week.
The results, which will be published on Tuesday, come at a difficult time for airlines following a second Ryanair 
profit warning in four months - which could lead to the budget carrier slashing its flight prices even further - piling the 
pressure on rivals such as Easyjet to follow suit.
Full-year results to the end of September, which were published in November, were in line with market 
expectations, with pre-tax profit up 41.4 per cent to £578m and revenue rising 16.8 per cent to £5.9bn.
"The company said it was expecting fuel costs to rise, despite a fall in the oil price," the Share Centre said.
"Oil has remained below $60 a barrel since then so it will be interesting to see if the company is sticking with its 
forecast.
"The market will also be looking out for any impact from the disruption caused by drones at Gatwick and Heathrow 
and any comments on plans to increase capacity will also be of interest."

Low-cost airline Ryanair has issued its second profit warning in four months, saying airfares were falling more than 
expected over the winter.
The company said yesterday that fullers, year profits would be in the range of (EURO)1bn-(EURO)1.1bn, down 
from (EURO)1.1bn-(EURO)1.2bn, because of a predicted 7 per cent drop in ticket prices. The previous forecast 
was for a 2 per cent fall, but fast growth in the number of seats is pushing down prices across the low-cost sector.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said he was "disappointed" about the downgrade and warned: "We cannot rule out 
further cuts to air fares and/or slightly lower full-year guidance if there are unexpected Brexit or security 
developments."
Alex Paterson, analyst at Investec, said he was "not surprised" by the warning. There have been notable service 
disruptions at Ryanair over the past 16 months, from staffing problems that caused the cancellation of thousands of 
flights in 2017, to a summer of strikes in 2018.
"They will be seeing some weakness from that," Mr Paterson said, "and the only lever they've got left to pull is to go 
on sale and push fares down." In a sale earlier this month, Ryanair was offering up to £30 off return flights.

seat numbers rise across sector
Ryanair had a summer of strikes across Europe last year, including five days by Irish pilots and two days of 
coordinated pan-European action by cabin crew. Spanish cabin crew called off three days of strikes earlier this 
month, but Reuters reported this week that several Ryanair pilots' unions had suspended talks because Ryanair 
was threatening to close their bases.
European airline shares have performed badly over the past year as high fuel prices, summer disruption and 
capacity growth have knocked investor enthusiasm. Ryanair is down 40 per cent on a year ago, while competitor 
easyJet has dropped almost a quarter. Hungary's low-cost carrier Wizz is down 14 per cent over the year.
Daniel Roeska, analyst at Bernstein, said he expected Ryanair's warning to weigh on other low-cost airlines but not 
the sector as a whole.
Ryanair and easyJet's strategy of boosting "ancillary" revenues meant they preferred to have fuller planes even if 
the fares were lower, Mr Roeska said.
Ryanair will publish its third-quarter results on February 4. In October, it lowered its full-year profit forecast from the 
range of (EURO)1.25bn-(EURO)1.35bn, blaming staff strikes, resulting compensation costs and the high price of 
oil. Shares fell on the profit warning in early trading, before closing little changed at (EURO)10.08. See Lex

 Stocks in London were higher at midday on Friday on hopes of a breakthrough surrounding the US-China trade 
talks.
There is some progress in US-China trade talks, with reports suggesting that the US is considering lifting tariffs on 
Chinese imports to calm volatile stock markets and encourage Beijing to make concessions in ongoing trade talks.
The Wall Street Journal newspaper on Thursday reported the US is considering lifting tariffs on Chinese goods in 
an effort to calm markets and give Beijing an incentive to make deeper concessions. People close to internal 
deliberations told the Journal that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin proposed the idea of lifting some or all tariffs 
in a series of strategy meetings. 
The FTSE 100 was up 81.58 points, or 1.2%, at 6,916.50, while the FTSE 250 was 125.81 points higher, or 0.7%, 
at 18,663.41. The AIM All-Share was up 0.7% at 910.40.
The Cboe UK 100 was up 1.3% at 11,751.28, while the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.9% at 16,672.33 and the Cboe UK 
Small Companies up 0.3% at 11,080.08.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.4%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt 1.1% was higher at midday.
"The WSJ article yesterday describing talks within the government of a potential easing in tariffs currently imposed 
on Chinese imports has helped boost market sentiment. Ultimately, with the US seeking concessions from the 
Chinese, they are clearly becoming aware that they will need to show good faith, and markets are clearly taking this 
potential move as a step closer to finding a deal between the two sides," said IG market analyst Joshua Mahony.
On the London Stock Exchange, ITV was the best blue chip performer, up 3.6% with shares in the broadcaster 
rebounding after being hit by a broker downgrade on Thursday. The stock closed down down 5.9% on Thursday.
At the other end of the large cap index, airlines were lower suffering a negative read-across after Irish carrier 
Ryanair Holdings issued a profit warning.
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Stocks Higher On US -China Trade Optimism
Ryanair shares were down 1.9%.
easyJet was the worst performer, down 2.4% and British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group 
was down 1.0%. easyJet was downgraded to Neutral from Overweight by JPMorgan.
For its financial year ending March, Ryanair is guiding for profit after tax of between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 
billion. Its prior guidance range was EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion.
Profit after tax in its previous financial year was EUR1.5 billion, meaning profit will be down as much as 50% in 
financial 2019. The previous year's figure had been up 10% on financial 2017. Winter fares are expected to fall 7%, 
Ryanair said, compared to prior guidance of 2%. 
ThinkMarkets analyst Naeem Aslam commented; "if you want to keep your investors happy, you need to make sure 
that you are running your affairs correctly. You cannot just afford battles with unions, or strikes as both of these 
effect company's growth number and most importantly you want to show that your customer service policies and 
the image is friendly and Ryanair really needs to get a good grip on this."
In the FTSE 250, Greencoat UK Wind was up 4.7% after the UK wind farms investor raised its annual payout 
following an increase in net asset value per share over 2018. 
The mid-cap company reported NAV of GBP1.39 billion as at December 31, or 123.1 pence per share. As at the 
end of 2017, Greencoat's NAV was GBP1.14 billion, or 111.2p a share. 
Greencoat declared a dividend of 1.69p per share for the final quarter of 2018, taking the total payout for the year to 
6.76p per share, up from 6.49p paid the year prior. For 2019, the company is targeting a dividend of 6.94p per 
share.
At the other end of the midcap index, Sophos Group was the worst performer, down 24% after the cyber security 
company reported a "subdued billings performance" for the third quarter of its financial year, which is expected to 
continue into the final quarter. 
For the three months to the end of December, billings dipped by 0.6% to USD193.7 million from USD194.0 million. 
For the nine-month period, billings increased slightly by 1.9% to USD546.4 million from USD536.3 million. 
Sophos attributed the subdued performance to a "modest decline" in billings from new customers, and a decline in 
hardware billings. This led to earnings before interest, taxes, deprecation and amortisation declining by 8.3% for the 
nine-month period to USD103.9 million from USD113.3 million. 
Notably, the group expects third quarter trends to continue into the final quarter of its financial year, which would 
lead to a modest decline in constant currency billings.
The pound was marginally higher, quoted at USD1.2955 at midday compared to USD1.2920 at the London equities 
close on Thursday, despite disappointing UK retail sales data. 
UK retail sales slowed in December from the prior month, as Black Friday sales shifted consumer spending away 
from the previously all-important Christmas season, the latest UK retail sales figures released by the Office for 
National Statistics showed. 
Data released from the ONS on Friday showed during the five weeks from November 25 to December 29, the 
overall quantity bought decreased by 0.9% on the prior month, as all sectors excluding food and fuel declined. The 
time period excluded Black Friday but included the technology sales day Cyber Monday. 
If compared with the same period a year earlier, December 2018 sales were up 3.7% in value and 3.0% in quantity. 
Meanwhile, in the three months to December, sales dipped 0.2% by volume and 0.1% by amount spent on the 
previous three months, with declines across all main sectors except fuel.
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Stocks Higher On US -China Trade Optimism
Stocks in New York are seen opening higher taking cues from Asia and Europe amid the positive trade sentiment. 
The DJIA was called up 0.5% and the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite were both called up 0.3%.
After the US closing bell on Thursday, credit card provider American Express reported quarterly earnings that 
missed Wall Street expectations, while online video streaming company Netflix topped fourth quarter subscriber and 
profit estimates.
In the US earnings calendar, the world's largest oilfield services firm Schlumberger will report fourth quarter 
earnings before the opening bell in New York. 
Financial markets in the US are closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Day while world leaders will gather in 
Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum starting on Tuesday.

Mid-Day Update: Wall Street Rallies As China Increases Efforts to Shrink Trade Surplus With US
Mid-Day Update: Wall Street Rallies As China Increases Efforts to Shrink

 Bulls maintained control on Friday as the most recent headlines surrounding the US/China trade relationship drove 
Wall Street's major indices to their highest levels in more than a month. China's gesture to address the swelling 
trade surplus with the US with a six-year, one trillion dollar buying spree added another 100 points to the Dow's 
already oversized gains, lifting the blue chip index by more than 350 points during the session and into the green for 
a fourth consecutive week. 
At midday, the Dow is nearly 3% above last Friday's close, while the S&P 500 is up 2.9% and the Nasdaq up 2.9% 
week-over-week.
China's efforts overnight to both stimulate its economy and accommodate the US with measures to boost demand 
of cars and appliances fueled overnight gains with bourses across Asia all measurably higher and European market 
indices at their highest levels since December.
US markets were already coiled for a rally at the open by favorable quarterly results and dovish comments from NY 
Fed president John Williams before the opening bell. Williams echoed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's view that the 
Fed can remain patient, adding that the Fed should be prudent and use "good judgment" given the recent economic 
uncertainty. 
Williams and trade optimism overshadowed a worrisome decline in consumer confidence as the University of 
Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index for January fell to 90.7 -- its lowest level since October 2016 -- from 
December's unrevised 98.3. 
But despite worsening consumer sentiment, industrial production was up a healthy 0.3% as manufacturing output 
surged 1.1% from November, its largest gain in almost a year. This raised capacity utilization to a nearly 4-year high 
of 78.7% from 78.6% in November.

European markets were in rally mode as well with Germany's DAX outperforming as all components of the index 
closed with outsized gains. Despite problematic stocks like Ryanair (RYAAY) and Telecom Italia that weighed on 
their respective sectors, indices across Europe were at least 1% higher. 
In corporate news, shares of Tesla (TSLA) are limping along nearly 10% lower after CEO Elon Musk warned 
employees of job cuts and lower profit in Q4 in an effort to cut the price of its Model 3 to $35,000. Shares were 
below their 200-day moving average for the first time in two weeks. 
Crude oil was up $1.52 to $53.59 per barrel. Natural gas was down $0.09 to $3.32 per 1 million BTU. Gold was 
down $9.70 to $1,282.50 an ounce, while silver was down $0.10 to $15.44 an ounce. Copper was up $0.04 to $2.72 
per pound.
Among energy ETFs, the United States Oil Fund was up 2.36% to $11.29 with the United States Natural Gas Fund 
down 1.17% to $27.94. Among precious-metal funds, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF was down 0.43% to 
20.62 while SPDR Gold Shares were down 0.68% to $121.28. The iShares Silver Trust was down 0.89% to $14.44.

 Stock prices in London are set for a higher open Friday, as lower air fares over the winter led Ryanair to cut its 
profit guidance for its current financial year. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 32 points higher at 6,866.30. The blue-chip index closed down 
27.76 points, or 0.4%, at 6,834.92 on Thursday.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed 1.3% higher Friday. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed up 1.4%, 
while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is 1.2% higher in late trade.
On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported US officials are "debating ratcheting back tariffs" as a way to bring 
some calm to markets and give China an incentive to make further concessions.
"Only yesterday we were discussing the weaker sentiment from increased US-Sino tensions, as the US took aim at 
Huawei. Overnight rumours went into reverse," said London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler.
"Talk of easing tensions were helping lift riskier assets. It seems almost impossible to sensibly gauge where US-
China relations stand. Yet the market hangs on each headline, highlighting just how sensitive it is to the ongoing 
trade issue."
"Last night, Wall Street surged higher on reports US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pushing for rolling back 
some tariffs levied on Chinese imports. Trade tensions have been weighing on investor sentiment for months, 
dragging equity, and more specifically industrials, on a roller coaster ride," he added. 
In the US on Thursday Wall Street ended in the green, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 0.7% higher, 
the S&P 500 0.8% higher, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.7%.
In early UK corporate news, Irish budget airline Ryanair has reduced its profit guidance, blaming lower fares over 
the winter period.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Ryanair In Profit Warning On Fare Cuts
For its financial year ending March, Ryanair is guiding for profit after tax between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion. 
Its prior guidance range was EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion.
Profit after tax in its previous financial year was EUR1.5 billion, meaning profit will be down as much as 50% in 
financial 2019. The previous year's figure had been up 10% on financial 2017.
Winter fares are expected to fall 7%, Ryanair said, compared to prior guidance of 2%.
However, the company did guide 9% growth in traffic to 142 million passengers in the current year, stronger 
ancillary sales, and a "slightly" better second-half unit cost performance so far.
Profit guidance excludes expected EUR140 million start-up losses from Austrian budget carrier Lauda.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said: "While we are disappointed at this slightly lower full-year guidance, the fact it 
is the direct result of lower-than-expected second-half air fares, offset by stronger than expected traffic growth, a 
better-than-expected performance on unit cost and ancillary sales is positive for the medium term." 
In the FTSE 100, Rio Tinto had a "pleasing" operational performance in the last quarter of 2018, with copper 
production a particular highlight.
Pilbara iron ore shipments of 87.4 million tonnes in the fourth quarter were down 3% on a year ago, but 7% higher 
than the third quarter of 2018. For 2018 as a whole, shipments totalled 338.2 million tonnes, up 2% on 2017.
Bauxite production in 2018 of 50.4 million tonnes was down 1% on last year, while aluminium production of 3.5 
million tonnes was down 3%. Mined copper was up 33% year-on-year at 633,500 tonnes and titanium dioxide slag 
was down 15% at 1.1 million tonnes.
Aluminium output fell due to ongoing labour disruptions at the non-managed Becancour smelter in Canada, Rio 
Tinto said, while copper came in above guidance due to a strong performance Escondida in Chile and higher 
grades at Rio Tinto Kennecott in Utah.
Safety, health, and environmental technology firm Halma has bought Rath Communications for USD32.6 million in 
cash. Rath provides emergency communication systems for Refuge Areas in the US. 
In the FTSE 250, IT firm Sophos reported 2% growth in constant currency billings for the third quarter ended 
December, with growth also 2% in the nine months year-to-date.
Sophos said "continued subdued performance" is partly due to a strong comparative period a year prior, and it 
expects trends in the third quarter to continue into the quarter ending March. 
Revenue is up 14% year-to-date, with subscription revenue 18% higher year-to-date and up 15% in the third quarter 
year-on-year at constant currency. 
Adjusted operating profit more than doubled year-to-date, Sophos said, due to strong revenue growth while it has 
posted a year-to-date operating profit of USD51 million from a loss of USD25 million year-on-year. 
Fresh and prepared food firm Bakkavor said revenue for its that year ended December 29 rose 2.2%, and 3.2% 
like-for-like, with "good" progress made across the company. 
In the UK, despite weak consumer confidence, like-for-like revenue increased 1.8%. Internationally, like-for-like 
revenue climbed 16% due to "good" volume growth. 
Overall, Bakkavor said this is a "robust" performance with expectations for the recently completed year unchanged. 
Elsewhere, property and construction firm Henry Boot said real estate activity met expectations for 2018. Excluding 
a one-off pension provision, it would have beaten expectations. 
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Ryanair In Profit Warning On Fare Cuts
This came despite "more challenging" conditions, Henry Boot said, with Brexit uncertainty hurting the real estate 
market in the UK.
The company's Hallam Land Management business did "exceptionally well", Henry Boot said, though uncertainty 
did hinder the performance of the Developments arm. 
Eddie Stobart Logistics posted 35% growth in revenue for its year ended November to around GBP843 million, 
beating market expectations. Like-for-like revenue rose 18%.
Eddie Stobart won GBP162 million of new contracts for the year, while margins have improved and are expected to 
improve further in its current financial year.
Underlying earnings before interest and tax are guided to meet market expectations. 
Back in the US, President Donald Trump has retaliated against his rival, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, 
saying he was postponing her planned trip to Belgium and Afghanistan, citing the ongoing partial shutdown of the 
US federal government.
Shortly thereafter, the White House said the US administration's delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos 
would not head to Switzerland for the annual gathering of world leaders and business elites next week. 
The measures add to the turmoil of the shutdown, which is now in its fourth week, with no sign of it ending, despite 
increasing warnings about the impact on the economy and the functionality of the federal government. 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May also has cancelled her planned attendance at Davos, as she battles to save her 
Brexit deal. "She won't be going to Davos," a Downing Street spokeswoman told dpa by telephone. "She will be 
staying to deal with other issues here."
Other government officials will still represent the UK in Davos, the spokeswoman added.
In the UK on Friday are retail sales figures for December at 0930 GMT.
"In November UK retail sales surged 1.4%, surpassing the most optimistic of expectations, largely as a result of 
Black Friday promotions and discounting," noted CMC's Hewson.
"The picture for December is unlikely to be anywhere near as good and given other similar surveys its quite likely 
that any spending could well have been left quite late, if it came at all," he continued.
The pound was higher quoted at USD1.2965 early Friday, compared to USD1.2920 at the London equities close on 
Thursday.
The international economic events calendar on Friday has eurozone current account numbers at 0900 GMT.

 US equity futures headed into the three-day weekend in rally mode early Friday, on trade optimism, with the S&P 
500 rising above key resistance of 2,640, said Dave Lutz, Head of ETFs at Jones Trading.
There was a sea of green overseas, with the DAX adding 1.5% and clearing 11,000. Autos ripped higher on trade 
hopes, and energy names were higher as oil jumped, while miners were bullish on Rio's earnings. The FTSE was 
up 1.4% as banks and commodity stocks rallied 2%, but airlines were weaker after RyanAir fell 2% on a profit 
warning. Volumes were strong, with most exchanges trading 30% to 50% above trend.
The Nikkei was up 1.3% in a broad advance, the Hang Seng was up 1.2%, Shanghai was up 1.4%, the KOSPI was 
up 80 points and the Aussie was up 50 points.
The US 10Y is cleared 2.75% as Fed Funds getting more hawkish, with chance of a rate hike in 2019 at 24%, and 
only a 5% chance of a cut. 
The US Dollar was looking to end its four-week losing streak as sterling was rejected from $1.3 on weak retail 
sales, and dollar-yen rose rose to two-week highs, but gains were mitigated in the greenback by a stronger euro.
Commodities were bid as ore and steel were up nearly 3% in China to two-month highs, and copper added 1.4% in 
London, while gold drifted around $1,300. Energy was mixed, as WTI climbed 1.3% with IEA's forecast of a ramp 
up in oil demand, but natural gas gave back 1.2 of Thursday's move. Softs added to gains amid a rise in both grains 
and beans on Argentina forecasts.

Ryanair Cuts Full-Year Profit Guidance as Winter Fares' Forecast Worsens

 Europe's biggest budget airline Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) cut its full-year guidance for profit after tax on Friday 
saying that it expects a steeper decline in winter fares, outweighing stronger traffic growth and ancillary sales in the 
current financial year.
Winter fares are now expected to drop by 7% as opposed to previous guidance of a 2% decline, the Dublin, Ireland-
based carrier said in a trading update. The deterioration in expectations has pushed the firm's profit-after-tax 
guidance lower, to a new range of 1.0-1.1 billion euros ($1.14-$1.25 billion) from a current range of 1.1-1.2 billion 
euros.
"There is short haul over-capacity in Europe this winter, but Ryanair continues to pursue our price passive/load 
factor active strategy to the benefit of our customers who are enjoying record lower airfares," Chief Executive 
Officer Michael O'Leary said in the update.
In contrast with falling fares, Ryanair said it expected stronger traffic growth this winter, which is now seen growing 
at 9% to 142 million versus an earlier estimate of 141 million. Similarly, the carrier is forecasting stronger ancillary 
sales and slightly better-than-expected unit cost performance in the fiscal second half.
"The fact that we are passing on these benefits, in the form of lower airfares, to customers is good for Ryanair's 
traffic growth, good for our business over the medium and long term, and good for market share," O'Leary noted. 
The Irish carrier, which became a poster child for trade union dispute after extended industrial action led to tens of 
thousands of flight cancelations in 2017-18, warned it couldn't rule out further cuts to air fares and/or slightly lower 
full-year guidance even though it had "reasonable" visibility over the forward bookings in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Further cuts at Ryanair, which is expected to report fiscal third-quarter results on February 4, would come to pass if 
there were "unexpected Brexit or security developments which adversely impact yields between now and the end of 
March," O'Leary added.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.----------COMPANIES----------Budget airline Ryanair Holdings 
reduced its profit guidance, blaming lower fares over the winter period. For its financial year ending March, Ryanair 
is guiding for profit after tax between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion. Its prior guidance range was EUR1.1 billion 
to EUR1.2 billion. Profit after tax in its previous financial year was EUR1.5 billion, meaning profit will be down as 
much as 50% in financial 2019. The previous year's figure had been up 10% on financial 2017. Winter fares are 
expected to fall 7%, Ryanair said, compared to prior guidance of 2%. However, the company did guide 9% growth 
in traffic to 142 million passengers in the current year, stronger ancillary sales, and a "slightly" better second-half 
unit cost performance so far. 
Profit guidance excludes expected EUR140 million start-up losses from Austrian budget carrier Lauda.----------Rio 
Tinto said it delivered a pleasing operational performance in the last quarter of 2018, with copper production a 
particular highlight. Pilbara iron ore shipments of 87.4 million tonnes in the fourth quarter were down 3% on a year 
ago, but 7% higher than the third quarter of 2018. For 2018 as a whole, shipments totalled 338.2 million tonnes, up 
2% on 2017. Bauxite production in 2018 of 50.4 million tonnes was down 1% on last year, while aluminium 
production of 3.5 million tonnes was down 3%. Mined copper was up 33% year-on-year at 633,500 tonnes and 
titanium dioxide slag was down 15% at 1.1 million tonnes. Aluminium output fell due to ongoing labour disruptions 
at the non-managed Becancour smelter in Canada, Rio Tinto said, while copper came in above guidance due to a 
strong performance Escondida in Chile and higher grades at Rio Tinto Kennecott in Utah. ----------Halma said it has 
acquired US-based emergency communication systems manufacturer Business Marketers Group, which trades as 
Rath Communications, for USD42.4 million in cash. The UK-listed fire and smoke detectors manufacturer said Rath 
Communications will become part of the company's infrastructure safety sector. The deal was completed on 
Thursday and is anticipated to be immediately earnings enhancing to Halma.----------Lloyds Banking Group has 
secured a banking licence in Germany as part of Brexit preparations, Reuters reported. Until now, the lender's 
Berlin-based subsidiary has run on a standard passporting licence that Lloyds - and other British lenders with 
customers in the EU - stand to lose when the UK leaves the bloc. In order to transform the Berlin branch into a full 
subsidiary, Lloyds will require a sum in the low hundreds of millions of pounds, Reuters said. Meanwhile licences 
the bank has applied for in Frankfurt and Luxembourg remain outstanding, Reuters added, but Lloyds is expected 
to have all regulatory approvals in place by March 29.----------Sophos Group fell to the bottom of the FTSE 250 as it 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Retail Sales Figures Disappoint In December
reported a "subdued billings performance" for the third quarter of its financial year, which is expected to continue 
into the final quarter. For the three months to the end of December, billings dipped by 0.6% to USD193.7 million 
from USD194.0 million. For the nine-month period, billings increased slightly by 1.9% to USD546.4 million from 
USD536.3 million. Sophos attributed the subdued performance to a "modest decline" in billings from new 
customers, and a decline in hardware billings. This led to earnings before interest, taxes, deprecation and 
amortisation declining by 8.3% for the nine-month period to USD103.9 million from USD113.3 million. The group 
expects third quarter trends to continue into the final quarter of its financial year, which would lead to a modest 
decline in constant currency billings.----------Bakkavor Group reiterated expectations for 2018 as it reported 1.8% 
like-for-like revenue growth for its core UK division despite weak consumer confidence. The company, which makes 
salads, pizza, ready meals and soups on behalf of UK supermarkets like Tesco, J Sainsbury, WM Morrison 
Supermarkets and Waitrose, recorded 3.2% year-on-year growth in group like-for-like revenue for the 52 weeks to 
December 29. Reported revenue increased 2.2%. Bakkavor's international division, comprising businesses in the 
US and China, delivered "good" volume growth leading to a 16% year-on-year jump in like-for-like revenue. ----------
MARKETS----------London shares were higher amid progress in US-China trade talks. ITV was the best blue chip 
performer, rebounding from sharp losses on Friday after being hit by a broker downgrade. The pound was 
marginally higher against the dollar despite disappointing UK retail sales data. Wall Street was pointed to a higher 
open with oilfield services company Schlumberger reporting earnings before the market open in New York. ----------

 Budget airline Ryanair Holdings on Friday cut its profit guidance, blaming lower fares over the winter period.
For its financial year ending March, Ryanair is guiding for profit after tax between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion. 
Its prior guidance range was EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion.
Profit after tax in its previous financial year was EUR1.5 billion, meaning profit will be down as much as 50% in 
financial 2019. The previous year's figure had been up 10% on financial 2017.
Winter fares are expected to fall 7%, Ryanair said, compared to prior guidance of 2%.
However, the Irish carrier did guide 9% growth in traffic to 142 million passengers in the current year, stronger 
ancillary sales, and a "slightly" better second-half unit cost performance so far.
Profit guidance excludes expected EUR140 million start-up losses from Austrian budget carrier Lauda.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said: "While we are disappointed at this slightly lower full-year guidance, the fact it 
is the direct result of lower-than-expected second-half air fares, offset by stronger-than-expected traffic growth, a 
better-than-expected performance on unit cost and ancillary sales is positive for the medium term."

Ryanair cut its forecast for full-year profit for the second time in three months on Friday, this time blaming lower 
than expected winter fares, and said it cannot rule out a further downgrade if Brexit causes unexpected 
developments.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier now expects profit after tax for its financial year to March 31 - excluding start-up 
losses at its Laudamotion unit - of between 1 billion euros and 1.1 billion euros, compared to a previous estimate of 
1.1 billion euros to 1.2 billion euros.
The Irish airline had originally forecast profits of 1.25 to 1.35 billion euros before October's profit warning took 
account of a series of strikes across Europe during the summer that hit traffic and bookings, but have since 
subsided.
On Friday, Ryanair lay the blame squarely on lower than expected fares in the second half of its financial year. 
Those fares were set to fall by 7%, rather than the 2% previously flagged, due to short-haul overcapacity in Europe, 
it said.
The lower fares have, however, been partially offset by stronger than expected annual traffic growth - now expected 
to grow by 9% to 142 million passengers - slightly better than expected unit costs and stronger ancillary sales.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said a further downgrade of the profit outlook was possible given 
uncertainty about the terms of Britain's planned departure from the European Union at the end of March.

"While we have reasonable visibility over forward Q4 bookings, we cannot rule out further cuts to air fares and/or 
slightly lower full year guidance if there are unexpected Brexit or security developments which adversely impact 
yields between now and the end of March," O'Leary said in a statement
Still, the better than expected unit cost performance allowed the carrier to cut its projected start-up losses in Lauda 
to 150 million euros from 140 million.
O'Leary said the fact that the airline was passing on lower air fares to customers would continue to be good for 
Ryanair's traffic growth and business over the medium to long term. (Reuters)

Highlight: Broad-based rally sees all but a handful of blue-chip stocks making gains, as Wall Street Journal reports 
US could lift China tariffs
Body
Update: The FTSE 100 has jumped 2% as a broad-based rally took hold on global markets after the Wall Street 
Journal reported the US was considering lifting tariffs on China.
The UK blue-chip index rose 133 points, or 2%, to 6,968, with only a handful of stocks failing to make gains.
Other European markets were also up strongly. The German DAX 30 was up 2.6% while the French CAC 40 rose 
1.7%. In the US, the S&P 500 rose 1.2% while the Dow Jones was up 1.9%.
The Wall Street Journal reported that US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin had proposed lifting some or all tariffs 
on China in a series of strategy meetings in a bid to advance trade talks and calm stock markets.
House builders, which have enjoyed a strong recovery from December lows since the turn of the year, were among 
the big FTSE 100 risers.
Barratt Developments (BDEV) was up 3.6% at 535p, Persimmon (PSN) rose 3.5% to £23.95 and Taylor 
Wimpey (TW) traded 3.2% higher at 167.2p.
Miners also rallied, buoyed by the prospect of a breakthrough in relations between the US and China, the world's 
top metals consumer.
Glencore (GLEN) rose 2.6% to 297.8p, Antofagasta (ANTO) added 3.8% to 854.8p and Anglo American (AAL) 
rallied 1.7% to £18.21.
The news also drove the oil price higher, with a barrel of Brent crude up 2.3% at $62.58. Shell (RDSb) was up 2.9% 
at £23.89 and BP (BP) rose 2.4% to 523.3p.
Airline groups EasyJet (EZJ) and British Airways owner International Airlines Group (ICAG) managed only 
modest gains, up 3p at £11.72 and 2.6p higher at 618.4p as rival Ryanair's (RYA.I) second profit warning in three 
months weighed.
FTSE surges 2% as US considers lifting China tariffs
A drop in winter fares – from a forecasted 2% to 7% – prompted the Ireland-listed budget carrier to cut full-year 
profit guidance by nearly 10%, though its shares clawed back losses to close marginally up.
‘That's a tough pill to swallow but there was a further sting in the tail as management warned it could not rule out 
further cuts to air fares or a reduction in guidance,’ said Markets.com chief market analyst Neil Wilson. 
But there were some positives for Ryanair, he said, with traffic growth of 9%, ahead of forecasts. Ancillary sales and 
better unit costs should also add some comfort, he said. 
‘Today's lower guidance is a sign that a higher cost base makes it more problematic to maintain margins when 
overcapacity means lower fares,' Wilson added. 
The pound fell 0.4% to $1.294 after Office for National Statistics figure showed a 0.9% fall in December UK retail 
sales, a bigger drop than expected.
‘For many economists this will be a further reflection of the state of consumer confidence,’ said Helal Miah, 
investment research analyst at broker The Share Centre.
‘Although others will point out that December’s figures were poor because seasonal sales were pulled earlier into 
the November Black Friday sales.’
The biggest faller among mid-cap stocks was software company Sophos (SOPH) which slumped 17.6% to 310.2p 
after it flagged slightly lower annual billings.

Aer Lingus chief executive Sean Doyle has declared that he shares IAG's confidence that its ownership structure is 
robust enough to survive Brexit.
Reacting to recent media reports questioning the parent group's ability to satisfy UK and EU ownership and control 
regulations, Doyle said during a briefing in Dublin on 17 January: "We have done our assessments and I absolutely 
share IAG's confidence."
Doyle says that draft legislation drawn up by the EU and UK "really understands the importance of the continuity of 
air travel" between the two.
Aer Lingus is, he stresses, "fully confident" it will be operating flights after 29 March, the scheduled date of the UK's 
exit from the EU.
Asked what impact he expected Brexit to have on the airline's feed traffic from the UK, Doyle said Aer Lingus was 
seeking to develop Dublin into a "great gateway to Europe". He also highlighted the "pace of economic 
development" in Ireland, to which he returned to take over the running of the airline earlier this month.
He asserts that Aer Lingus offers a "unique" experience and positioning on the transatlantic market.
Speaking at the same event, Tourism Ireland chief executive Niall Gibbons said the UK was Ireland's "bread and 
butter" tourism market and would remain so after Brexit.
He notes that – following a "blip" in British visitors in 2017, when sterling depreciated 20% versus the euro – spend 
by British tourists increased 3% in 2018 and visitor numbers rose 1%.

Neither Aer Lingus nor Ryanair has seen any impact from Brexit on passenger arrivals into Ireland from the UK, 
adds Gibbons.

Ryanair lowers profit forecast amid tough competition

LONDON (AP) - Budget airline Ryanair, Europe's biggest carrier by passengers, has warned its profits will be lower 
than expected - the second such downgrade in four months - because of weaker fares over the winter.
The company said Friday it expects full-year profit of between 1 billion euros and 1.1 billion euros, down from a 
range of 1.1 billion euros to 1.2 billion euros previously. It said that while traffic is up, winter fares are expected to 
fall 7 percent.
CEO Michael O'Leary noted there was stiff competition and expects some rival budget carriers to fall out of the 
market. Companies like WOW and Flybe have been up for sale after struggling financially.
O'Leary warned profits could be hit further if Brexit complicates air travel between the U.K. and other European 
countries.

Highlight: It only takes a quick glance down a busy street to see the effects of an app-orientated world: everyone 
seems to be on their phone or tablet. People want a fast and reliable mobile experience that is not crippled by an 
unreliable internet connection, writes Huw Owen, Head of EMEA & APJ at Couchbase.
Body
Huw Owen, Head of EMEA & APJ at CouchbaseEven if it’s just for thirty seconds, the result of a poor or lost 
connection is no longer just inconvenience for the user – it can in fact be crippling for the wide variety of businesses 
that rely on mobile apps to operate.What’s more, lack of connectivity isn’t the only thing that causes problems. A 
user interacting with an app can result in hundreds of exchanges of data over the internet. If the connection is weak 
or the app is data-intensive, it can make for a poor user experience.We may be at a point where the sophistication 
of mobile apps is surpassing big screen alternatives, but most mobile apps – whether digital banking, field service 
such as utilities, ecommerce, navigation, or something else – still connect to cloud-based databases and therefore 
rely on a stable, strong connection to operate properly and ensure a satisfactory user experience.Businesses are 
starting to realise that in order to meet the expectation for a consistently good user experience at any place, any 
time, even when offline, they need to store some data securely on the device itself. Embedding a database within a 
mobile app might seem a complex concept, but there are already plenty of companies that have taken the leap with 
huge success.By recognising the key takeaways from the below examples, businesses should realise offline-ready 
mobile apps with embedded databases are not to be feared, but instead present a great opportunity.From the Shop 
Floor to the Side-lines, it’s Time to Go OfflineFor businesses, transforming mobile processes to operate anywhere, 
at anytime, may seem an impossible task. 
Thanks to offline access and data synchronisation, however, businesses within a variety of sectors have been able 
to do just this.For retailers, the need to operate mobile applications offline is more pressing than ever, since network 
reliability in stores can be compromised by unreliable WiFi and poor reception. One way to overcome this is by 
giving employees access to offline-first mobile apps on their devices, as Louis Vuitton has done.Its sales staff do 
not need an internet connection to source product information, but instead use an app that synchronises catalogue 
data to instantly show customers the most up-to-date product information. This not only improves customer 
experience, but also makes employees’ lives easier and the sales process significantly more efficient.Parcel 
Making the Most of Mobile Opportunities With or Without the Internet
delivery company Doddle has put in place offline capabilities to improve the service it offers in busy locations such 
as railway stations, where networks are often congested. Its staff can continue to serve customers regardless of 
whether their devices have connectivity or not. Similarly, Ryanair has made its in-app booking process 60 percent 
faster by using technology that stores semi-static data locally on the user’s device. The app’s embedded database 
provides customers with instant offline access to their flight information, yet any changes made while offline will still 
be reflected once the connection is restored.Gone are the days of helplessly praying the internet doesn’t cut out 
when making that all-important booking – all thanks to Ryanair capitalising on the new mobile capabilities the digital 
age has to offer.Adding offline capabilities to mobile applications also opens a range of opportunities that simply 
weren’t possible before. For example, SyncThink has pioneered an innovative sports technology that uses offline 
capabilities to assess injuries on the side-lines during rugby games. Its eye-tracking technology (EYE-SYNC) helps 
doctors spot and treat concussion symptoms far faster than previously. In busy sports stadiums, where thousands 
of fans’ devices can hinder connectivity, not needing a constant internet connection is crucial in delivering accurate 
results.Taking the PlungeGetting offline-first mobile right does present some challenges and in order to get it right, 
organisations should consider the following:Search: Mobile apps must be able to search the relevant database – 
either embedded in the app, or in the cloud – effectively, even when connectivity is lost. Offline apps need to quickly 
query and deliver accurate information to users as promptly as those connected to the internet.Sync: One of the 
main requirements for mobile applications today is to deliver an always-on experience with guaranteed data 
availability, even when there is intermittent network connectivity. Peer-to-peer synchronisation is one way for 
businesses to have devices talking to each other and exchanging data when there is a patchy internet 
connection.Security: It is somewhat inevitable that the more operations run across multiple devices, the more 
security risks emerge. Since offline apps exchange data between other devices, the internet and the cloud, 
businesses must look at their security practices across all devices and platforms. In particular, secure transporting 
and storage of data, authentication, and data access control are key functions to have at the top of the 
agenda.Scalability: Mobile is only set to grow in prevalence and so it’s vital that businesses future-proof their mobile 
infrastructure, with the flexibility to scale from hundreds to millions of users if required.Make the connectionFor 
many organisations today, doing mobile successfully means maintaining at least some capabilities when devices 
are offline or suffering from slow or patchy connection. We’re already starting to see examples of organisations 
across all industries expanding their mobile horizons with the capability to do just that.These organisations all have 
one thing in common: they have invested in the right database platform to underpin these new applications: one 
that is responsive, secure and extends to the edge with offline capabilities.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) said pre-market Friday that it is cutting its profit forecast for full-year 2019 due to record lower air 
fares.
The Irish low-budget carrier said it expects full-year profits to be in a range of EUR1.0 billion ($1.13 billion) to 
EUR1.1 billion from the previous range of EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion. The lowered guidance comes after 
winter fares dropped 7% compared with the prior projection of a 2% decline. Still, the carrier expects to carry more 
travelers than forecast, up 9% to 142 million from the previous estimation of 141 million. It also sees better-than- 
expected performance on unit cost.
The profit warning excludes start-up losses in Austrian airline Lauda, which have been slashed from EUR150 
million to EUR140 million on the back of better-than-expected unit cost performance during the winter period, 
according to Ryanair.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. stocks rebounded Friday on hopes for a thaw in the U.S.-
China trade conflict.   There is some progress in U.S.-China trade talks, with reports suggesting that the U.S. is 
considering lifting tariffs on Chinese imports to calm volatile stock markets and encourage Beijing to make 
concessions in ongoing trade talks.   The benchmark FTSE 100 was up 65 points or 0.95 percent at 6,899 in 
opening deals after closing 0.4 percent lower on Thursday.   Low-cost airline Ryanair dropped 1.4 percent after yet 
another profit warning while rival easyJet shed 1.7 percent.   Cyber security expert Sophos slumped 23 percent 
after the company reported 'subdued performance' in its third quarter trading update.  Halma edged up slightly after

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) announced the company 
lowered its full year profit guidance (excl. Lauda) to a new range of 1.0 billion euros- 1.1 billion euros from a current 
profit after range of 1.1 billion euros - 1.2 billion euros due to: lower winter fares, stronger traffic growth, stronger 
ancillary sales, and a slightly better than expected H2 unit cost performance. The guidance excludes (exceptional) 
start-up losses in Lauda.  Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: 'While we are disappointed at this slightly lower full year 
guidance, the fact that it is the direct result of lower than expected H2 air fares, offset by stronger than expected 
traffic growth, a better than expected performance on unit cost and ancillary sales is positive for the medium term.'

Ryanair pilot unions in 'several countries' suspend talks

Ryanair pilot unions in several countries have suspended talks with management in protest at what they see as the 
airline using the threat of base closures as a bargaining tool in labour talks, the European Cockpit Association 
(ECA) said on Wednesday.
The unions include those representing pilots in two of Ryanair's biggest markets, a union source told Reuters, 
declining to name which markets they were.
The temporary suspension is a reaction to Ryanair's closure of bases in the Dutch city of Eindhoven and Bremen in 
Germany and the reduction of capacity in the German region of Niederrhein. The European Cockpit Association in 
October described the move as a "declaration of war".
Ryanair has also threatened to close two bases in the Canary Islands if cabin crew in Spain do not sign up to a 
collective labour agreement by next week, the ECA said on Wednesday.
Spanish cabin crew called off planned strikes last week after reaching a preliminary agreement on contracts.
A spokesman for Ryanair was not available for immediate comment.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier suffered a number of strikes last year by pilots and cabin crew, grounding 
hundreds of flights across Europe, after it agreed to recognise unions for the first time in 2017 following rostering 
difficulties.
But it got through Christmas without any industrial action, having made progress with a number of unions that it 
expects to translate into agreements with its major unions by the end of March. (Reuters)

Mary Poppins' bird lady said it would only take tuppence to keep her pigeons flying, writes Kate Burgess. "Come 
buy my bags full of crumbs ... You'll be glad if you do ... All it takes is tuppence from you". But Connect Airways - 
the consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart and Cyrus Capital - thinks a penny is enough to keep Flybe's aeroplanes 
filling the skies.
Flybe's board agrees, although the 1p offer and 47 per cent fall in Flybe's shares to tuppence a piece has not made 
investors feel uplifted. However, Connect is paying a heavier price than Flybe's £9m market value suggests. The 
total cost will be at least £185m, including a £10m bridging loan. Flybe faces multiple challenges. It competes with 
trains and road on 100-plus regional routes, with Ryanair and easyJet swooping in to compete on the most lucrative 
ones. And it is weighed down by a legacy of excess capacity and costs, resulting in £82m-plus in debt.
Yesterday Connect underlined how much it cared by amending the deal terms to secure Flybe faster and fend off a 
collapse. It clearly thinks the cost of allowing Flybe to fail is greater than the immediate cost of rescuing it.
Virgin and Stobart may be right.
Virgin, which is investing £50m in cash, wants Flybe as a feeder airline for its transatlantic flights. Stobart is 
protecting its Southend airport. It is less clear why Cyrus is putting in £65m for a 40 per cent stake. It must believe 
in airborne returns. But only in Mary Poppins does anyone defy gravity.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) pilot unions in several countries have temporarily suspended labor talks with officials to 
denounce what they perceive as the company using the threat of base closures as a bargaining tool in negotiations, 
Reuters reported.
The suspension of talks come after the Irish-based budget carrier closed bases in Eindhoven in the Netherlands 
and Bremen in Germany. The European Cockpit Association told Reuters that Ryanair also threatened to close two 
bases in the Canary Islands if Spanish crew members do not agree to a collective labor agreement by next week.
The unions that have decided to suspend talks represent pilots in two of Ryanair's largest markets, a union source 
told the news agency. A representative for the low-budget airline company was not immediately available for 
comment, Reuters said.

       No-deal Brexit: Total chaos or free-trade bonanza?   LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Extreme doomsday scenarios for a 
no-deal Brexit - often based on loosely-defined scenarios - forecast grounded passenger planes, enormous queues 
at customs points and businesses crippled by bureaucratic chaos.  Pro-Brexit lawmakers from Prime Minister 
Theresa May's Conservative party, many of whom prefer no deal to her deal, insist that there is little to worry about.  
The truth probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes. 
 If British lawmakers do not accept May's withdrawal deal and fail to ratify it before March 29, Britain would be on 
track for an unregulated Brexit.  Britain could seek an extension of the two-year Brexit negotiating process triggered 
by May in March 2017.  Otherwise, EU rules would cease to apply in Britain, which would drop out of shared 
arrangements such as common air-traffic rules or trade deals with third countries.  The land border between 
Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland poses a particular problem. Efforts to keep that border open have been 
at the heart of Brexit negotiations.  British citizens living in the EU and EU citizens in Britain could also face 
uncertainty over their status.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned on Friday that the economic 
consequences of a no-deal Brexit 'would be profound, widespread and lasting.'  'Businesses would face new costs 
and tariffs,' CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said in a speech. 'Our ports would be disrupted, separating firms 
from the parts they need to supply their customers.'  Eurosceptics say such predictions are part of a 'project fear' to 
persuade people to accept May's deal.  They say the two sides would be able to implement a series of rapid, 
sectoral mini-deals to minimize disruption before they negotiate an alternative, perhaps Canada-style deal after 
Brexit.  In their favour, two of the largest budget airlines operating in Britain - Ryanair and easyJet - have both said 
in recent weeks that they anticipate relatively little disruption from a no-deal Brexit.  Jean-Marc Puissesseau, head 
of the French ports of Boulogne-Calais, told the BBC last week that he had been preparing for a no-deal Brexit for a 
year and 'will be ready' in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal.  'We will not check the trucks more than we are 
doing today with the migrants,' Puissesseau said, referring to checks for illegal migrants trying to reach Britain from 
France.  In parliament on Wednesday, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a senior member of May's cabinet, 
said there had been 'some exaggerated claims about the impact of a no-deal Brexit, and the British economy is 
resilient.'  In answer to a question on the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on agriculture, however, Gove agreed 
that 'farmers in some of [Britain's] most vulnerable sectors ... would be significantly adversely affected in the short

term.'  The Brexiteers argue that any short-term damage would be more than offset by the long-term, liberal trade 
deals Britain plans to sign with major non-EU economies such as the United States, China and India.  May 
announced plans last month to make planning for a no-deal Brexit an 'operational priority' for the government.  She 
told parliament that a no-deal Brexit would bring risks to 'the jobs, services and security of the people we serve by

'such as the flow of traffic into different ports here in the UK.'  But she stopped short of earlier forecasts of doom 
issued by her government and the central bank.  Under her withdrawal agreement, Britain's economy would be 3.9 
per cent smaller in 15 years' time than it would be if the country remained in the EU, according to a government 
forecast in late November.  A no-deal Brexit would see GDP fall even further, by 9.3 per cent over the same period, 
it said.  The Bank of England forecast the same day that the pound would depreciate by 25 per cent against the US 
dollar in a 'disorderly' scenario.  In that case, inflation could skyrocket to 6.5 per cent, and unemployment to 7.5 per 
cent, while GDP could fall by nearly 8 per cent, the bank said.  Angry Brexiteers dismissed the two reports, while 
even pro-EU economist Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England adviser, tweeted that both forecasts appeared 
to 'support political objectives.'   Copyright dpa

Jan 15, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  An elderly man 
ended up more than 1,000 miles away from his intended destination after Ryanair crew failed to notice he boarded 
the wrong flight.Pawel Lawreniuk, 75, who was scheduled to fly back to his hometown of Gdansk in Poland 
fromBradford in England, mistakenly landed in Malta. The Ryanair plane took Lawreniuk to Maltaon Jan. 6,the daily 
newspaper for Bradford, Telegraph ...gus[1], reported Monday, adding that the man's ticket showed the flight he 
was expecting to catch wasto Gdansk. 
Lawreniuk's daughter, Lucyna, said she dropped her fatheroff at the airport with plenty of time in hand. "I double 
checked the ticket, printed it and it said Gdansk. There was a call to me, at work and I saw it was from Malta. I 
thought oh s---, there's something wrong. I then saw someone writing on WhatsApp and saw the message,"Lucyna 
said. "I cried, I was scared - he was in a different country a different place." Lucyna added that her father told her 
that when he boarded the plane, he showed his ticket to the crew but no one pointed out that he was on the wrong 
flight. With the help of a Polish-speaking woman at the airport in Malta,Lawreniuk was able to return home safely. 
However, his daughter said she was angry about the mix-up. "We are aware that a passenger was able to board an 
incorrect flight at Leeds Bradford Airport on Sunday 6 January," a representative forSwissport, the handling agency 
for Ryanair at the airport, said. "The passenger had undergone all airport security screening before boarding the 
flight and had a valid passport which had been checked...We are investigating how this occurred and we are re-
briefing all staff on the procedure. We would like to apologize to Mr. Lawreniuk for the inconvenience caused." A 
Ryanair flight mistakenly flew an elderly man 1,000 miles away from his destination to another country. In this

Images/Pau Barrena Lucyna also told local media her father was upset about the entire incident and told her he 
would not want to visit her next year. "My father told me he doesn't want to come to me next year. He doesn't want 
to fly anymore. Today I spoke with him about everything and he's had bad dreams - I'm worried about him, but 
hopefully everything will be ok," she said. She added: "If someone didn't come forward, I'm not sure what would 
have happened - he had no money, no phone, he can't really do anything alone." In another incident of an airline 
mix-up that took place in 2018, an elderly woman was booked to travel from El Salvador to North Carolina - but 
boarded[2] the wrong plane during a stopover in Houston and ended up in Denver, Colorado.Eighty-year-old Maria 
Larios, who could not speak English and is partially blind, was traveling tostay with her daughterwho was about to 
undergo brain surgery. The United Airlines staff did not notice the woman had boarded the wrong flight. The airline 
later apologized for the incident. [ 1]: https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/17357459.ryanair-fly-75-year-

Ryanair Boeing 737-800, Rome, 10 November 2008
The report on an unusual attempted go-around following a severe birdstrike on short final approach to Rome 
Ciampino 10 years ago has finally been published by Italian investigator ANSV. On 10 November 2008, a Ryanair 
Boeing 737-800 flew through a dense flock of starlings just 300m (984ft) before the threshold of runway 15 while 
descending through a height of 140ft. The ANSV says go-around thrust was selected, but then the crew retracted 
the flaps to their 10° setting, rather than the 15° required for a go-around. The aircraft suffered about 90 bird 
impacts, resulting in a loss of power in both engines just 100m from the runway threshold. The 737 briefly climbed 
from 112ft to 173ft but failed to maintain the climb and it began to descend. 
There was a stick-shaker warning at 21ft, and the aircraft struck the ground in a stalled condition. The flaps were 
still retracting and had reached 12.1° at the time of impact, which registered 2.66g. The aircraft came to a halt 50m 
from the far end of the runway having sustained serious damage to its left-hand main landing-gear, aft fuselage and 
left engine from contact with the runway. The investigator comments that since the multiple birdstrike was likely to 
have caused damage, the decision to go around was questionable, but understandable given the surprise factor. 
The inquiry believes the startle effect explains the retraction of the flaps to 10° despite the existence of a detent in 
the 15° position intended to reduce the risk of flap retraction beyond the go-around setting. The ANSV notes that 
Boeing has since added recommended birdstrike techniques to the 737 crew training manual, and that Ryanair has 
adopted specific training for birdstrikes during take-off and landing.

TAP Air Portugal Airbus A340-300, Rio de Janeiro, 8 December 2011
After seven years, Brazilian investigator CENIPA has finally disclosed that a taxi route error caused an Airbus 
A340-300 (CS-TOD) to overrun the runway on take-off from Rio de Janeiro, resulting in a collision with approach 
lights and navigation aids before climbing away and flying safely to its destination at Lisbon. The crew of the TAP 
SAFETY: Accident inquiry reports from the second half of 2018 E Accident reports issued during the second 
half of 2018
Air Portugal aircraft, bound for Lisbon, had been instructed to taxi for runway 10, which had already been effectively 
shortened by construction works that rendered the first 1,270m unavailable. Take-off calculations showed that the 
remaining 2,730m was sufficient for a reduced-thrust "flex" take-off, from the displaced threshold, at a temperature 
of 34°C (93°F). To reach the displaced threshold the aircraft needed to taxi to the AA intersection. But the crew 
inadvertently taxied to the BB intersection, which lay some 600m further down the runway – leaving just 2,095m for 
the take-off run. Airbus analysis showed that this distance was insufficient for the A340 to become airborne, even if 
it had used maximum take-off thrust. The inquiry highlights the layout of the taxiway system which, it believes, 
contributed to the blunder. While visibility was good, the departure occurred at 22:37, some 2h after sunset. The 
A340 overran the runway, leaving tyre marks for 200m beyond, and striking approach lights, as well as the localiser 
antenna 360m from the runway end. "The pilots did not realise they had crossed the runway boundaries, because 
of the aircraft's nose-up attitude," it adds. Neither could see the lights at the end of the runway. None of the 255 
passengers and 11 crew was injured, although the aircraft sustained minor damage, and approach lighting parts 
were found in its landing-gear after arrival.
Malaysia Airlines MH370, 8 March 2014
Malaysian authorities have published what may well be the final report on the loss of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. 
It proposes that the aircraft was probably deliberately manoeuvred off its planned course to its final oceanic resting 
place. The 777-200ER (9M-MRO) has not been found and, considering that its believed location is on the seabed 
somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean, it may never be. For lack of specific evidence, the finger of blame has not 
been pointed at any particular individual in the crew. Meanwhile, although the evidence for deliberate direction of 
the aircraft is circumstantial, there is a considerable quantity of it, starting with the aircraft's silent turn-back at an 
airspace boundary, a point at which surveillance continuity is naturally broken. This coincided with the abrupt loss of 
five systems specifically for communicating location, without any indication of a technical fault. Studies of the 
intriguing subsequent flightpath have been unable to attribute the track to system anomalies. Indicators in the 
mystery include the disturbingly precise course from the turn-back point to Penang (the captain's birthplace), then 
the careful avoidance of Indonesian airspace before heading for oceanic oblivion. Finally, there was the discovery, 
on the captain's home simulator, of plotted waypoints charting a similar course. That verdict, however, is only likely 
to be validated if the aircraft's wreckage is ever discovered, but all searches have been called off and will not be re-
instated, unless completely new evidence is uncovered.

XL Airways Airbus A330-200, over the Mediterranean, 26 December 2014
French air accident investigator BEA has described a series of failures that degraded flight control and autonomous 
navigation systems on an XL Airways Airbus A330-200 (F-GRSQ) in the cruise over the Mediterranean four years 
ago. BEA says the aircraft ultimately lost all three inertial reference systems (IRS) and suffered a degradation of its 
autonomous navigation capabilities, as well as a reversion to direct flight-control law. The aircraft had departed 
Reunion for Marseille, with one of its three IRS demonstrating a significant drift (IRS2). Although the associated air 
data inertial reference unit (ADIRU) was supposed to have been replaced two days earlier, an identification mix-up 
meant the wrong unit was swapped. BEA did not have cockpit voice-recorder (CVR) data and it says crew 
testimonies differ, but proposes a probable sequence of events. About 5h into the flight, IRS3 switched from 
"navigation" to "attitude" mode – probably through crew action, says the inquiry. The flight-guidance computer 
rejected IRS3 and used the information derived from the other two systems, IRS1 and the drifting IRS2. This 
change was only noticed by the relief first officer after he took over some 2h 30min later. The crew attempted to 
align IRS3. BEA says, however, that the discrepancy between IRS1 and the drifting IRS2 prompted a 
disengagement of the autopilot, autothrust and flight directors, and the disappearance of position and flightplan 
information on the navigation displays. While the crew was able to retrieve position and flightplan data by activating 
a navigation back-up mode, position information on the captain's side was lost. BEA believes that, as the crew 
sought to restore the captain's data, they triggered an in-flight alignment of the three IRS, which resulted in a 
transition of the A330 to direct flight-control law. No technical fault could be found to explain the triple simultaneous 
alignment. Primary flight display information disappeared and the crew had to resort to standby electromechanical 
SAFETY: Accident inquiry reports from the second half of 2018 E Accident reports issued during the second 
half of 2018
instruments and manual flight for the rest of the journey. As the aircraft approached Greek airspace, the crew 
declared an emergency, opted for a diversion to Athens, and the aircraft was vectored to runway 03R, where it 
landed without further incident. BEA says the loss of positional data was a "major concern", but that use of a newer 
flight management system (FMS) standard would have prevented it.
Air France Boeing 777F, Paris Charles de Gaulle, 22 May 2015
An Air France Boeing 777F (F-GUOC) was saved from damage by the operation of its tailstrike protection system 
during take-off from Paris Charles de Gaulle's runway 26R in May 2015, according to BEA. The agency reports that 
the cause was entry of an incorrect take-off weight by the crew during performance calculations. Take-off speeds 
and power settings for the aircraft's flight to Mexico City had been calculated using a weight of 243t, rather than the 
actual figure of 343. This major error meant the calculated rotation speed of 152kt (282km/h) with flap position 5 
was well below the required 175kt and flap 15. The crew were alerted by the tail-strike warning to apply full power, 
which they did some 8s after the protection system engaged, having limited the maximum rotation to 9° nose up. 
BEA says the 777F passed the opposite-direction threshold at a height of 172ft. There was no stall alarm and the 
stick-shaker did not activate. While the CVR transcript was unavailable to the inquiry, the investigators state that the 
crew discussed returning to the airport but ultimately decided to proceed with the flight. Apparently, the computed 
configuration of the aircraft surprised one of the supernumerary pilots on the flightdeck, but he had failed to voice 
his doubts.
EgyptAir Airbus A320, over the Mediterranean, 19 May 2016
BEA, which has been aiding the Egyptian probe into the fatal loss of an EgyptAir Airbus A320 (SU-GCC) two years 
ago, has voiced strong criticism of the inquiry process. The inquiry was turned over to judicial authorities at the end 
of 2016, and since then, the technical investigators have been denied access to data and evidence. The A320, 
operating a service from Paris to Cairo on 19 May 2016, departed its cruise altitude of 37,000ft and came down in 
the Mediterranean Sea. Early evidence from debris, the CVR and avionics systems suggest the "most likely" theory 
that a rapidly developing avionics bay fire led to the accident. But seven months into the probe the Egyptian 
investigators declared they had discovered traces of explosives on human remains. This led the inquiry to pursue 
the theory that sabotage brought down the aircraft, and jurisdiction was transferred entirely to the Egyptian criminal 
and legal authorities. BEA comments: "[Our] proposals concerning further work on the debris and recorded data 
were not, as far as BEA knows, followed up." The French investigator has pressed for the safety investigation to be 
continued, but when it met the Egyptian attorney general earlier this year, the Egyptians remained inflexible. BEA 
says Egyptian investigators have not published a final report that would have allowed the BEA to lay down its 
"differences of opinion", as permitted by air accident investigation protocol. Should Egyptian investigators opt to 
restart the safety probe, BEA says it will be "ready to continue collaborating". It is not the first time foreign accident 
investigators have clashed with Egyptian authorities over the causes of high-profile air accidents over Egypt, or 
involving Egyptian aircraft. One of them involved a Flash Airlines Boeing 737-300 fatal crash at Sharm el-Sheikh in 
January 2004. The US National Transportation Safety Board and BEA both stressed that evidence pointed to 
spatial disorientation in the crew, but the Egyptian authorities insisted the causes were technical. NTSB 
investigators also disputed the Egyptian claim that technical failures brought down an EgyptAir Boeing 767-300ER 
off the US east coast in October 1999, when the NTSB says evidence pointed to deliberate actions by the aircraft's 
first officer.

ASL Airlines Boeing 737-400F, Milan Bergamo, 5 August 2016
Pilots of an ASL Airlines Boeing 737-400 freighter (HA-FAX) failed to realise how much runway had passed 
beneath the aircraft before making a late touchdown, which resulted in a high-speed overrun at Milan Bergamo. The 
crew had been conducting a night instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 28 in poor weather. While 
the pilots had briefed for an auto-land, the Italian investigation authority ANSV reports that they disengaged the 
autopilot and landed manually. Some 9nm (17km) from the runway, the captain decided that, owing to the presence 
SAFETY: Accident inquiry reports from the second half of 2018 E Accident reports issued during the second 
half of 2018
of storms in the missed approach path, a go-around would be unwise. The first officer had logged just 86h on 737s, 
and told the inquiry that, while he was tempted to question this decision, he felt he did not have the experience to 
evaluate the situation, but admitted that a go-around call "could have been a good idea", because the rain was 
intense and only the runway edge lights were visible. Both pilots’ attention was focused on acquiring external visual 
references and they "did not realise" the aircraft had overflown the wet runway at 20-30ft for 18s at high speed, 
travelling some two-thirds of its length. After touchdown, the jet overshot the runway end by 520m, suffering 
extensive damage as it crossed roads and struck obstacles before coming to rest. The inquiry says the crew did not 
monitor flight parameters adequately during the last stages of flight and failed to disengage the autothrottle before 
landing, although the captain had one hand on the thrust levers. The inquiry says that he did not recall that moving 
them would not disconnect the autothrottle. Flight data recorder (FDR) readings showed that the engine thrust 
reduced as the autothrottle transitioned to "retard" mode, as designed, at a height of 27ft, but engine thrust 
subsequently showed variations, increasing to as much as 97% N1, which the inquiry states were "presumably due 
to action by the crew". This resulted in an increase in the landing speed, and the prolonged float of the aircraft, 
before it touched down at 159kt. The investigator says fatigue, while not perceived by the crew, could have 
degraded the pilots' decision-making processes. Both evacuated the aircraft but had suffered injuries during the 
accident and were hospitalised.
Jet Airways Boeing 777-300ER, London Heathrow, 30 August 2016
Jet Airways has amended its standard operating procedures for take-off following an incident that involving one of 
its Boeing 777-300ERs (VT-JEK) at London Heathrow airport. The aircraft was taking off for Mumbai at 20:30 UTC, 
when it crossed the airfield boundary at 13ft above ground level and an adjacent road at 30ft above ground level. 
There were no reports of injuries among the 15 crew and 231 passengers on board. The UK Air Accidents 
Investigation Branch (AAIB) classified the case as a serious incident, and delegated the investigation to India's Air 
Accident Investigation Bureau. In its final report, the Indian inquiry found that VT-JEK accepted clearance to take off 
on runway 27L from intersection S4E, rather than from N1, which would have provided the full runway length. But 
the crew then used performance figures based on the take-off roll beginning at N1, because the captain selected 
the first of four entry points for runway 27L presented by the On-Board Performance Tool (OPT), which calculates 
performance based on the roll beginning at N1. The co-pilot had calculated performance correctly for a take-off from 
S4E, the actual point of entry to the runway. The discrepancy between the two calculations was noticed during the 
crosscheck of the OPT outputs, but the co-pilot entered the captain’s figures into the control and display unit (CDU). 
This meant that power was set assuming full runway length when the distance available was 760m less than that. 
Rotation was initiated with 556m of runway remaining and lift-off occurred with 97m remaining. Jet now requires its 
crew to call out and resolve discrepancies between the output of the captain's and co-pilot's OPTs before entering 
data into the CDU.
Aerosucre Boeing 727-200F, Puerto Carreno, Colombia, 20 December 2016
Colombian investigators have found that an Aerosucre Boeing 727-200 freighter's crew miscalculated crucial take-
off speeds before the aircraft overran the runway 25 at Puerto Carreno and collided with obstacles before becoming 
airborne. It attempted to climb away but, having been badly damaged by the impact, lost height and crashed. Just 
one of the six occupants survived. Investigation authority GRIAA determined that several factors extended the 
aircraft's take-off run by 383m, on a runway just over 1,800m in length. The aircraft had a "Quiet Wing" modification 
which improved take-off performance by increasing flap droop, but the crew were provided with no guidance about 
its use, and employed a reduced flap setting of 25°. The flap droop would have given a rotation speed of 122kt, but 
the crew calculated rotation at 127kt, which added 103m to the ground run. The investigators also found that the 
727 had taken off in a 4kt tailwind that lengthened the take-off by another 146m. The two previous departures had 
used the opposite-direction runway 07, but the inquiry found no evidence that the crew had been passed the actual 
wind velocity by ATC. Finally, GRIAA added that the pilot's rotation technique – a slow pitch rate of 7° in 7s – meant 
the aircraft required a further 134m to become airborne. The inquiry had also been unable to find weight and 
balance details from the flight among the debris, or a copy of this data in the company's offices. Analytical 
calculations estimated the take-off weight at 74.2t, just under the maximum permissible figure of 74.7t. But based 
on the take-off speeds used by the crew, the inquiry believes the weight was around 75.3t – meaning the jet was 
SAFETY: Accident inquiry reports from the second half of 2018 E Accident reports issued during the second 
half of 2018
overweight by 590kg (1,300lb). The report reveals, finally, that the aircraft should not have been operating at Puerto 
Carreno airport, because it was not approved by the authorities for this aircraft type. But history also shows the 
authority had accepted 727 flightplans for the airport for seven years before the crash, without taking action.
Jet Airways Boeing 737-800, Goa, 27 December 2016
India's investigator reports that a Jet Airways Boeing 737-800 crew did not allow the aircraft's engines to stabilise 
their thrust after line-up on Goa's runway 26 before beginning the take-off run, and asymmetric power caused a 
runway excursion. The aircraft, bound for Mumbai, had backtracked the runway and performed a 180° turn to line 
up. The accident report says when the crew began to advance the thrust levers as they lined up, the left-hand 
engine was starting from 40%, and the right-hand one had only reached 28% when the captain commanded full 
take-off thrust. "As soon as [full thrust was commanded] the aircraft started drifting right and exited the hard 
surface," says the inquiry. The crew attempted to brake and use rudder and nose-wheel steering to bring it back on. 
The jet left the runway and turned in a wide right-hand arc, eventually coming to rest facing the opposite direction 
some 220m from the edge of the runway. In so doing it collided with a path-indicator lamp as well as a 2.3m pillar, 
and the aircraft suffered substantial engine, undercarriage and fuselage damage. Sixteen of the 145 occupants 
suffered minor injuries during the evacuation. The inquiry states that the rejected take-off manoeuvre was 
conducted "incorrectly", pointing out that only the right-hand thrust lever was retarded to idle thrust.
Sunwing Airlines Boeing 737-800, Belfast, 21 July 2017
Pilots of a Sunwing Airlines Boeing 737-800 twice entered an incorrect temperature figure during take-off 
calculations, so it took off from runway 07 at Belfast, Northern Ireland with insufficient thrust and almost overran the 
runway. A figure of -47°C was erroneously entered as the outside air temperature. Such an abnormally low 
temperature figure would cause the N1 calculation to be "significantly below" that required for take-off thrust, says 
the UK AAIB. It points out that -47°C was the outside air temperature for the first waypoint after top-of-climb, 
recorded on the pilot's log. Following a delay for a tyre change the crew entered revised figures but made the same 
entry error as before. As the 737 reached 120-130kt during its take-off run, the crew realised it was "not 
accelerating normally", says the inquiry. The take-off run available was 2,654m. No action was taken, either to 
increase thrust or abort the take-off. Some 900m before the end of the runway the aircraft reached the V1 threshold 
and rotated shortly afterwards. Once airborne the crew checked the take-off performance figures, finding that the 
N1 level had been just 81.5%, far below the 92.7% required. Thrust was not increased until the aircraft had reached 
800ft, some 2nm after becoming airborne. Investigators state that the 737 escaped damage and continued to its 
destination. But the inquiry points out that only the absence of obstacles and a "benign" nature of the runway 
location and surrounding terrain prevented a potentially "catastrophic" accident, should the jet have suffered engine 
failure.
CityJet Bombardier CRJ900, Turku, 25 October 2017
Investigators report that a CityJet-operated Bombardier CRJ900 landed at Turku, Finland in a 10kt tailwind on a 
contaminated runway, hydroplaned, and finally spun more than 180° before coming to rest. The crew of the aircraft, 
conducting a service for SAS, had opted to use runway 26 despite the tailwind, because there was no ILS on the 
reciprocal. The aircraft was also near its maximum landing weight. The CRJ900 landed at 148kt in the touchdown 
zone, and the landing was relatively hard at 1.95g. The captain had selected reverse thrust immediately after 
touchdown but the aircraft’s bounce inhibited this system by taking the weight off the undercarriage and preventing 
the wheels from spinning, so the engines remained at reverse idle. When the nose-gear made runway contact the 
captain initiated manual braking, but the aircraft's wheels were hydroplaning and did not spin up. The wheels locked 
some 5s after landing and the aircraft skidded for 2,050m, almost the entire length of the landing roll, says the 
Safety Investigation Authority of Finland. Some 1,200m from touchdown the jet began veering to the right, striking 
runway edge lights, and almost exiting the runway surface. But it started rotating to the left, still travelling at 42kt 
while sliding sideways. The aircraft eventually came to rest just 160m from the runway end, having turned through 
an anti-clockwise arc of 196°. The air temperature was around freezing, with a gusting wind from the southeast, and 
the runway was covered with more than 10mm of slush. Runway conditions had been assessed 21min before the 
SAFETY: Accident inquiry reports from the second half of 2018 E Accident reports issued during the second 
half of 2018
CRJ900 landed, and an estimate passed to the crew, but heavy snow was falling and the runway conditions were 
"changing rapidly", says the inquiry. No new measurements were carried out before the jet landed, and 
maintenance personnel had decided to clear the runway only once the aircraft arrived and another flight had 
departed. None of the tyres deflated and the inquiry says this meant the friction between the wheels and the runway 
was "extremely low" throughout. None of the 92 occupants was ultimately injured, but the report adds: "The 
occurrence had potential for a serious or major accident." Investigators point out that the logic of the reverse-thrust 
system on the CRJ900 is such that, if selected prematurely on landing, it cannot be regained without specific pilot 
actions. The inquiry has recommended that Bombardier provides information to operators regarding this aspect of 
the thrust-reverser system.

Brussels has written to the 27 states that will remain in the EU once Britain leaves the bloc, asking them to explain 
"as a matter of urgency" how the airlines they license will comply with its rules on ownership.
In a letter sent last week, seen by the Financial Times, Violeta Bulc, the transport commissioner, said that not every 
national government had detailed their plans on how carriers would meet "ownership and control requirements in all 
the possible scenarios" of Brexit. These scenarios include a no-deal exit, where the UK leaves without an 
agreement.
Ms Bulc asked transport ministers - "given the remaining short timeframe ahead" - to explain how affected airlines 
licensed by each country would meet the requirements on March 30, the day after Britain leaves the EU, and 
whether national authorities thought these measures sufficient.
The rules stipulate that carriers must be owned and controlled by more than 50 per cent of EU investors in order to 
retain their ability to fly freely within the bloc.
Ms Bulc's letter represents a ramping up of no-deal preparations. She had previously written to member states in 
July 2017 asking them to clarify how they intended to comply with the rules. Some companies - including IAG, 
owner of British Airways and Iberia - have yet to ensure they will reach that threshold after Brexit, when investors 
who are UK nationals will no longer be included in the tally.
Doubts over airline rights post-Brexit; Airlines ; EU states yet to clarify how they will comply with operational 
rules
Ryanair and easyJet have announced that they will remove voting rights from non-EU shareholders to meet the 
threshold if need be, while both have applied for secondary operating licences to allow flights to continue - Ryanair 
from the UK and easyJet from Austria.
The FT reported last week that Brussels had warned IAG that its favoured plans for its airlines to continue flying in 
and around Europe in the event of a nodeal Brexit would not work.
Part of IAG's strategy to maintain both UK and EU operating rights is to stress that its most important individual 
airlines are domestically owned through a series of trusts and companies, rather than being viewed as part of the 
bigger group, which has a high proportion of non-EU investors.
The Spanish government later told Reuters news agency it was "convinced that Iberia is a Spanish company", but 
added: "We are also convinced that, if necessary, the company will make the necessary adjustments to make sure 
it complies with European regulations."
IAG, which is a Spanish company that has its headquarters in the UK, said: "We are confident we will comply with 
the EU and the UK ownership and control rules post-Brexit."

RYANAIR came under renewed criticism yesterday from a leading consumer rights activist for refusing to refund 
customers who were allegedly charged fees in error.
Hundreds of customers were required to pay a £115 name change surcharge due to a "glitch" on Ryanair's website 
which caused incorrect surnames to be recorded on passenger bookings, according to consumer website 
www.Moneysavingexpert.com (MSE).
The website's founder Martin Lewis has written to Michael O'Leary, calling on the Ryanair chief executive to deliver 
on his promise to make it "a nicer airline" by resolving the issue.

       No-deal Brexit: Total chaos or free-trade bonanza?   LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Extreme doomsday scenarios for a 
no-deal Brexit - often based on loosely-defined scenarios - forecast grounded passenger planes, enormous queues 
at customs points and businesses crippled by bureaucratic chaos.  Pro-Brexit lawmakers from Prime Minister 
Theresa May's Conservative party, many of whom prefer no deal to her deal, insist that there is little to worry about.  
The truth probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes. 
 If British lawmakers do not accept May's withdrawal deal and fail to ratify it before March 29, Britain would be on 
track for an unregulated Brexit.  Britain could seek an extension of the two-year Brexit negotiating process triggered 
by May in March 2017.  Otherwise, EU rules would cease to apply in Britain, which would drop out of shared 
arrangements such as common air-traffic rules or trade deals with third countries.  The land border between 
Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland poses a particular problem. Efforts to keep that border open have been 
at the heart of Brexit negotiations.  British citizens living in the EU and EU citizens in Britain could also face 
uncertainty over their status.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned on Friday that the economic 
consequences of a no-deal Brexit 'would be profound, widespread and lasting.'  'Businesses would face new costs 
and tariffs,' CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said in a speech. 'Our ports would be disrupted, separating firms 
from the parts they need to supply their customers.'  Eurosceptics say such predictions are part of a 'project fear' to 
persuade people to accept May's deal.  They say the two sides would be able to implement a series of rapid, 
sectoral mini-deals to minimize disruption before they negotiate an alternative, perhaps Canada-style deal after 
Brexit.  In their favour, two of the largest budget airlines operating in Britain - Ryanair and easyJet - have both said 
in recent weeks that they anticipate relatively little disruption from a no-deal Brexit.  Jean-Marc Puissesseau, head 
of the French ports of Boulogne-Calais, told the BBC this week that he had been preparing for a no-deal Brexit for a 
year and 'will be ready' in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal.  'We will not check the trucks more than we are 
doing today with the migrants,' Puissesseau said, referring to checks for illegal migrants trying to reach Britain from 
France.  In parliament on Wednesday, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a senior member of May's cabinet, 
said there had been 'some exaggerated claims about the impact of a no-deal Brexit, and the British economy is 
resilient.'  In answer to a question on the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on agriculture, however, Gove agreed 
that 'farmers in some of [Britain's] most vulnerable sectors ... would be significantly adversely affected in the short 
BACKGROUND
term.'  The Brexiteers argue that any short-term damage would be more than offset by the long-term, liberal trade 
deals Britain plans to sign with major non-EU economies such as the United States, China and India.  May 
announced plans last month to make planning for a no-deal Brexit an 'operational priority' for the government.  She 
told parliament that a no-deal Brexit would bring risks to 'the jobs, services and security of the people we serve by 
turning our backs on an agreement [with the EU].'  May highlighted preparations for potential post-Brexit problems 
'such as the flow of traffic into different ports here in the UK.'  But she stopped short of earlier forecasts of doom 
issued by her government and the central bank.  Under her withdrawal agreement, Britain's economy would be 3.9 
per cent smaller in 15 years' time than it would be if the country remained in the EU, according to a government 
forecast in late November.  A no-deal Brexit would see GDP fall even further, by 9.3 per cent over the same period, 
it said.  The Bank of England forecast the same day that the pound would depreciate by 25 per cent against the US 
dollar in a 'disorderly' scenario.  In that case, inflation could skyrocket to 6.5 per cent, and unemployment to 7.5 per 
cent, while GDP could fall by nearly 8 per cent, the bank said.  Angry Brexiteers dismissed the two reports, while 
even pro-EU economist Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England adviser, tweeted that both forecasts appeared 
to 'support political objectives.'   Copyright dpa

Flight delays in Europe more than doubled last year as airlines and air traffic controllers failed to hit EU 
performance targets.
Delays rose to a total of 19.1m minutes last year, double that of the previous year. The average delay per flight was 
1.73 minutes in 2018 against EU performance targets of half a minute. However, the number of flights hit a record 
11m, according to figures from Eurocontrol, which co-ordinates national air traffic management agencies.
The figures were contained in an email sent by Eurocontrol directorgeneral Eamonn Brennan, seen by the Financial 
Times. The email also highlighted that September 7 2018 was the busiest day in European aviation history, with 
37,101 flights.
Eurocontrol had previously projected the total minutes of delay for 2018 would rise to 14.3m in 2018, much lower 
than the final figures.
In his email, Mr Brennan wrote that lack of capacity and staff shortages among air traffic controllers were 
responsible for 60 per cent of the delays, followed by weather, 25 per cent, and strikes, 14 per cent.
John Strickland, an aviation consultant, said he did not expect things to get better "unless there's a reduction in 
traffic". However, capacity figures published by EU airlines indicate that the number of flights is set to grow this 
year.
Air traffic controller shortages see flight delays in Europe soar; Airlines
Mr Strickland also pointed to the slow development of the Single European Sky project, which was supposed to 
improve efficiency but is "woefully far from fruition".
Strikes by and shortages of Europe's air traffic controllers have infuriated airlines, prompting British Airways owner 
IAG and low-cost carriers Ryanair, Wizz Air and easyJet, to file complaints with the European Commission. The 
airlines claimed that the commission's failure to deal with strikes in countries such as France was breaching 
Europeans' freedom of movement, one of the EU's four fundamental freedoms.
IAG's low-cost Vueling airline, based in Spain, has in the past had 50 per cent of its flights affected by strikes.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, has criticised the "lethargy and inaction" of the commission and 
national governments. In Europe, air traffic control is managed on a national level. "Nothing will get in the way of the 
four freedoms, unless you're a French air traffic controller," he said.
European transport commissioner Violeta Bulc has called for more investment and adoption of technology by EU 
states to combat delays. Last summer's congestion, she said, was "stimulating everyone to act".

Soothing words do little to calm anxious flyers. Nor will they be much help in dealing with a disorderly Brexit.
Anglo-Spanish airlines group IAG has exuded confidence about its ability to navigate tricky ownership rules. But the 
latest signals from Brussels are not reassuring.
Airlines operating within the EU need to show that at least half their shares are held and controlled by EU nationals. 
Only a fifth of IAG's shares will be owned by these bestowers of grace, according to broker Davy. IAG is coy about 
how it would avoid falling foul of the ownership rules. But it will try to rely on a convoluted structure that ensures 
voting rights are held locally - by the El Corte Inglés store owner in the case of Iberia, it emerged recently. Brussels 
may be unconvinced.
A sense of proportion is necessary.
Fears of big restrictions on flights into the EU or US will not be realised. The extra pressure on sterling resulting 
from a disorderly Brexit is probably more important than the ownership issue, although IAG is better hedged than 
some rivals. A lot of bad news is already in the share price. IAG shares are trading on less than six times next 
year's earnings, near an all-time low.
IAG's inscrutable calm contrasts with Ryanair's longstanding warnings of "chaos". If there is a hard Brexit, the low-
cost rival plans to strip UK shareholders of voting rights.
IAG/Brexit: flight plight Twitter : @FTLex
If they opt to sell, they will only be able to trade with Europeans. Brits, like other non-EU nationals, can buy US 
depositary receipts. Tellingly, the premium over ordinary shares has already risen steeply, up from 5 per cent to 30 
per cent in the two years after the vote, says Citi.
EasyJet has similar powers. It is already close to the threshold, with 47 per cent of shares held by Europeans.
Most MPs want to avoid a disorderly Brexit. But if they fail, investors must hope IAG's arrangements pass muster.
Their confidence will not be helped by the lack of transparency. Expect more flight anxiety to come.

Soothing words do little to calm anxious flyers. Nor will they be much help in dealing with a disorderly Brexit.
Anglo-Spanish airlines group IAG has exuded confidence about its ability to navigate tricky ownership rules. But the 
latest signals from Brussels are not reassuring.
Airlines operating within the EU need to show that at least half their shares are held and controlled by EU nationals.

Ryanair 's Spanish cabin crew unions call off Tuesday strike

Unions representing Ryanair cabin crew in Spain called off plans to strike on Tuesday to allow time for further talks, 
the SITCPLA and USO unions said in a statement.
Ryanair suffered a number of strikes last year by pilots and cabin crew, forcing it to cancel hundreds of flights, after 
the airline recognised unions for the first time in 2017.
But it got through Christmas without any industrial action.
According to the strike plans agreed with the Spanish labour authorities, cabin crew union members would operate 
all flights between Spanish islands and 50 percent of flights between Spanish islands and the Spanish mainland on 
the strike days.
But they will only operate 25 percent of flights to and from Spain over 500 km.
Ryanair last week said it did not expect customers would be disrupted by the action but a spokesman for the 
SITCPLA union said he did not think disruption to flights could be avoided if cabin crew go through with their strike 
action. (Reuters)

Birdstrike highlights startle effect risk; Ryanair captain's rea c tion to hazard

The consequences of the startle effect have been highlighted by Italian investigators in their probe into a Ryanair 
Boeing 737-800 landing accident at Rome Ciampino airport, after the jet flew through a dense flock of birds on final 
approach.
It states that the aircraft’s captain saw the flock moments before touchdown, as the jet descended below 140ft at a 
distance of just 300m (984ft) from Ciampino’s runway 15.
Italian investigation authority ANSV says that go-around thrust was commanded, but the crew retracted the flaps to 
their 10° setting rather than the 15° required for a go-around.
The aircraft flew through the flock, suffering a serious birdstrike that involved nearly 90 impacts, resulting in a loss 
of power in both engines just 100m from the runway threshold.
It briefly climbed from 112ft to 173ft but failed to gain altitude and started to descend. The jet’s nose-up attitude and 
loss of airspeed generated a stick-shaker warning at 21ft, and the aircraft struck the ground in a stall condition.
The flaps were still retracting and had reached 12.1° at the time of impact, registered at 2.66g.
ANSV says the aircraft stopped 50m from the threshold of the opposite-direction runway 33, having sustained 
serious damage to its left-hand main landing-gear, and there was evidence of damage to the aft fuselage and left 
engine, caused by ground contact.
While the inquiry’s findings have been newly published, the accident occurred more than a decade ago, on 10 
November 2008.
Birdstrike highlights startle effect risk Ryanair captain's rea c tion to hazard sho r tly before Rome Ciampino 
landing underlines danger in instin c tive respo....
At the time, says ANSV, there were no guidelines for managing and mitigating the startle effect – the instinctive 
reaction to sudden and unexpected events.
This effect influenced the Ryanair crew’s actions, notably the decision to try a go-around when – given that the jet 
was 7s from touchdown – proceeding with the landing was likely to have been the safer option.
ANSV points out that, during approach at low thrust settings, the engine core is less susceptible to birdstrike 
damage, while commanding full thrust could increase the risk of damage and loss of power at a critical stage.
The inquiry also believes the startle effect explains the instinctive decision to retract the flaps to 10°, an action that 
overcame the detent in the 15° position intended to prevent retraction beyond the go-around setting.
“From the statement made by the captain, the selection was not voluntary nor was there any awareness of the flaps 
selection error,” says ANSV. “This action is indicative of a reaction to an unexpected situation.”
The inquiry says the crew had not been given sufficient instruction concerning the most suitable procedures to 
adopt in the event of a birdstrike during the landing phase, and there was an absence of specific training to cope 
with the startle effect.
But ANSV notes that Boeing then introduced recommended birdstrike techniques into the 737 crew training manual, 
while Ryanair developed specific training for bird encounters and strikes during take-off and landing.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) received an investment-rating downgrade to sell from hold from Berenberg as the firm 
warned clients the Irish airline "faces sustained competitive pressure to pricing, while its cost progress remains 
highly uncertain." 
Berenberg also reduced its price target on Ryanair's shares. Its price target on the company's Dublin-traded shares 
is now EUR9.75, down from EUR12.60. In Ireland, the shares traded at EUR10.55, down 1.0% during Tuesday's 
session. 
In a note to clients, Berenberg said its downgrade of Ryanair's stock comes as "sustained challenges from lower 
fares and non-headline fuel costs lead us to lower our [fiscal] 2019 net income estimate to below the company's 
guidance range." 
The firm added: "We expect continued pressure on valuation while the market awaits more clarity on the timing and 
amplitude of labor cost inflation." 
Berenberg also said the stock's valuation is "tempting" but it sees "little to re-rate shares or to flip earnings 
momentum: We expect another down year in net income in [fiscal] 2020, and see fewer paths to growth."

Ryanair attacks compensation 'grey area' Airlines. EU regulations European carriers fume over laws open to

Ryanair attacks compensation 'grey area'; Airlines. EU regulations European 
carriers fume over laws open to interpretation and inconsistent court rulings

When Ryanair issued a profit warning last year, it blamed three things: the high oil price; staff strikes and the cost of 
compensating customers for delayed or cancelled flights under European Commission regulations.
Compensation re-emerged as Ryanair's bête noire in December when the UK's Civil Aviation Authority announced 
it was taking enforcement action against the airline for flight disruption over the summer.
Ryanair, whose passengers suffered delayed or cancelled flights because of eight days of strikes by pilots and 
cabin crew, said at the time that it was not liable for compensation under EU rules because of "extraordinary 
circumstances".
But if the CAA manages to win its case, leaving Ryanair with a possible bill in excess of (EURO)8m, then it will be 
another blow for an airline that was on the back foot for much of last year as staff industrial action and air traffic 
control strikes disrupted its business.
It is not just Ryanair that has been affected by EU rules that are - in the eyes of some airline bosses and industry 
observers - inconsistent and hard to interpret, despite the worthy aims of compensating passengers for disruptions. 
This has prompted senior figures in aviation to call for reform of the regulations, known as EU261. Alexandre de 
Juniac, chief executive of airline body the International Air Transport Association, said in an October 2018 speech: 
"EU261 is still a mess for airlines and passengers, and a bonanza for claims agencies and their dubious practices."
Ryanair attacks compensation 'grey area' Airlines. EU regulations European carriers fume over laws open to 
interpretation and inconsistent court rulings
He said he was pleased the European Commission had issued some clarifying guidance, but "the European Court 
of Justice continues to issue intolerable interpretations".
The controversy centres on a "grey zone" at the heart of the regulations, which mandates compensation of 
(EURO)250, (EURO)400 or (EURO)600 per passenger, depending on the length of the flight and the cause of the 
cancellation or delay.
The rules say airlines must pay for disruption except in "extraordinary circumstances" but without giving a clear 
definition of what these are.
The confusion has been exacerbated by conflicting decisions in the European courts. The European Court of 
Justice ruled in April that compensation should be paid for disruption caused by wildcat strikes as they were 
"inherent" in an airline's business and were not extraordinary.
But courts in Germany, Spain and Italy ruled that properly notified strikes are an "exceptional circumstance" and 
compensation does not apply - a decision Ryanair hopes will be followed in its dispute with the CAA.
Carriers Wizz Air, British Airways' owner IAG, and easyJet have all been hit by costs due to the regulations.
Jozsef Varadi, chief executive of Hungary's low-cost Wizz Air, said jet fuel rises and compensation costs due to the 
regulations were "two major drivers of squeezing the industry" in the autumn.
Wizz's EU compensation bill was a large chunk of its earnings at about (EURO)30m a year, or 10 per cent of its 
2018 pre-tax profit of (EURO)286m.
IAG recorded a (EURO)65m provision in 2017 for "additional compensation fees and baggage claims" after a power 
failure at Heathrow forced British Airways to cancel 726 flights over three days and left at least 75,000 passengers 
stranded.
IAG said: "Both consumers and airlines would benefit from greater clarity about what can be claimed under the 
EU261 regulation."
In easyJet's 2018 annual report it said it had made a provision for European regulations of £39m by the end of 
September.
In the case of Ryanair, it already has a bitter history with the regulations. In 2017, it paid (EURO)25m in 
compensation costs after it cancelled 2,000 flights in September and October because of rostering problems.
It also noted in its most recent annual report that "passengers have a higher propensity to claim [under EU261] than 
in prior years". Chief executive Michael O'Leary has previously called the regulation "ridiculous".
Sara Drake, senior lecturer in law at Cardiff University and author of a European Parliament report on the matter, 
said the law was "poorly drafted" with broad provisions that each side could interpret to its own benefit.
Ms Drake's report found that sanctions for trying to avoid compensation regulation claims were "not imposed in a 
systematic manner" and that wide variation in their enforcement across the EU, largely due to the grey zone, 
undermined the measure.
However, both Ms Drake and John Davies, a solicitor-advocate with law firm Slater & Gordon, agreed that Ryanair 
was unlikely to be successful against the CAA. Ms Drake said she would be "very surprised" if Ryanair won, given 
judicial precedents.

BERLIN (AP) - Security staff at Berlin's two airports are staging a strike that is causing disruption to flights.
The ver.di union called on staff at the German capital's Tegel and Schoenefeld airports to walk off the job from 5 to 
8:45 a.m. (0400 to 0745 GMT) Monday.
German news agency dpa reported that airlines including Lufthansa, Easyjet, Ryanair and Aeroflot canceled flights 
ahead of the walkout. Several flights were significantly delayed.
Ver.di has said employers "provoked" the strike by offering a pay increase of 2 percent over two years.
The union wants hourly pay for all workers conducting security checks to rise to 20 euros ($22.81). Employer 
association BDLS says this could amount to a 30 percent increase in some cases.
The next round of talks is due on Jan. 23.

RYANAIR has been named the UK's worst short-haul airline for the sixth year in a row.
A passenger survey, carried out by Which, put the Irish budget airline at the bottom of 19 carriers flying from the 
UK.
Ryanair achieved a customer score of 40 per cent compared to a 63 per cent score for its main rival Easyjet.
Thomas Cook Airlines and Wizz Air also scored poorly, with rankings of 53 per cent and 54 per cent respectively.
In autumn 2017, Ryanair announced it did not have enough pilots for scheduled flights and cancelled bookings for 
an estimated 400,000 people.
Customers were also frustrated by the airline changing its luggage rules, and for delays.
Ryanair told Which it had experienced problems as a result of strikes, and said customers will continue to book with 
the airline as "having the lowest price wins every time".
Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment.

aviation industry from its high-priced, oligopolistic torpor into a world of low fares, insurgent competitors and bold, 
irreverent promotion.
It was only on June 18 1971, after four years of legal challenges by rivals, that Southwest's first aeroplane was able 
to take off. In doing so it launched a model that has spread throughout the world and brought aviation to the 
masses.
The year Southwest launched, 332m people worldwide took a flight; by 2017, that number had grown to 4bn, 
swollen in part thanks to $100 flights from Houston to New York and £15 trips from London to Bucharest - all 
ultimately enabled by Kelleher.
In 1992 Michael O'Leary, now chief executive of low-cost carrier Ryanair, flew to Texas to meet the fun-loving, 
chain-smoking and hard-drinking Kelleher, to learn how his budget airline worked and to see if there were any 
insights he could take back to Ireland.
Mr O'Leary said: "There's an entire generation of people under the age of 40 who don't realise flying used to be 
expensive and the privilege of the very rich few. That's entirely down to Herb Kelleher, his vision, his revolution and 
his spirit."

Kelleher was widely cited in management books for how he sustained the Southwest culture. In Great by Choice, 
Jim Collins and Morten Hansen hailed him as "a fanatic exemplar of the culture", adding: "He wasn't weird to be 
weird; he was behaving with outlandish consistency to animate the culture, like an impactful actor who stays 
perfectly in character while on stage. He was also a complete monomaniac about building Southwest Airlines."
Mr O'Leary said Kelleher had a "geeshucks surface" but was "scarily bright" - and drank him under the table at 
dinner: "He spent 87 years defying the known conventions of the airline, tobacco and alcohol industries."
Born on March 12 1931, Herbert David Kelleher was raised in Haddon Heights, New Jersey, and attended 
Wesleyan and New York universities, from the latter of which he received a law degree. He practised law on the 
East Coast, but moved to Texas to start his own firm, and it was with his client Rollin King that he devised Air 
Southwest (renamed Southwest Airlines by its launch), to provide low-cost flights within Texas. In 1967, they drew 
up the plan on a cocktail napkin in a bar in San Antonio, the city that would become one corner of the Texan 
triangle - Dallas and Houston were the two others - where Southwest first flew.
But US aviation was dominated by established players, not least Texasbased American Airlines, which did not want 
an upstart undercutting them.
The other carriers lowered their prices, but could not match Kelleher's unit costs, which he kept down by using only 
one type of aeroplane, having fewer staff on each and getting more flights out of an aircraft in a day, thanks to 
halfhour turnrounds. These practices have become standard in low-cost aviation.
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter gave Southwest the fillip it needed by deregulating the industry, removing 
government control of fares, routes and market entrants. Expansion was swift. Even Warren Buffett, who had made 
his distaste for investing in aviation clear, has come to own 10 per cent of Southwest via his Berkshire Hathaway 
group.
When Stevens Aviation challenged Southwest over its use of the "Just Plane Smart" advertising tagline in 1992, 
Kelleher suggested that he and Kurt Herwald, the head of his rival, should armwrestle to settle the matter. Even 
though Kelleher lost the contest, Stevens let Southwest keep the tagline.
Kelleher was executive chairman of Southwest from March 1978 to May 2008 and president and CEO from 
September 1981 to June 2001. He remained on staff after bowing out as executive chairman, when he received 
"the kind of standing ovation usually reserved for rock stars" at the annual meeting, according to the New York 
Times.
In 2015, the FT chose Kelleher as one of its 50 leading business pioneers and wrote that Kelleher "continues at age 
84 to smoke and drink enthusiastically, and has embraced eye-catching stunts".
A short while later Kelleher sent a letter to the FT in response: "Sir, I was so viscerally and cerebrally honoured by 
my selection ... that I smoked three packs of cigarettes and drank a quart of bourbon, thereby impairing both my

Ryanair Holdings Plc on Thursday received a license from the British aviation regulator that will allow it to operate 
within the U.K. and to non-European Union routes even if the country leaves the bloc without a deal.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, said in November that it was prepared for a no-deal and that it was not 
seeing any impact from Brexit on demand for flights. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary had earlier warned that a 
disorderly Brexit could ground flights for several weeks after the U.K. leaves on March 29.
A departure agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May with Brussels hangs in the balance ahead of a 
parliamentary vote this month. British lawmakers will take a decision on whether to accept May's plans for a 
managed exit or reject the deal and spawn huge uncertainty about the country's next steps.
Brexit minister Stephen Barclay warned on Thursday that the country is more likely to end up leaving the EU 
without a deal if parliament rejects May's deal with Brussels.
Ryanair's smaller rival easyJet also said last year that it was prepared for a no-deal scenario and that Brexit 
uncertainty was not having any impact on ticket sales.

Low-cost carrier Ryanair has secured a UK operating licence, meaning the London-listed and Dublin-based airline 
can continue domestic flights in the country and flights from Britain to outside the EU in the event of a no-deal 
Brexit.
Juliusz Komorek, Ryanair's chief legal and regulatory officer, warned that the risks of a no-deal Brexit were rising 
and called for the UK and EU to agree a transition deal to avoid disruption to holidays in the summer.
The airline applied for the air operating certificate in late 2017.
Its UK domestic routes accounted for only 1 per cent of capacity in 2018, according to its annual report, but it also 
flies from the UK to non-EU destinations, including Morocco and Norway.
Hungary's Wizz Air obtained a UK operating licence in May 2018 for the same reason, while easyJet, a UK-based 
company, has been granted an Austrian operating licence to ensure European flights in the region can continue.
Ryanair is facing ownership problems around Brexit too.
Under existing rules, airlines must prove they are 50 per cent EU owned and controlled to qualify for operating 
licences.
Ryanair has tried to respond to the problem by preparing plans to take away voting rights from its non-EU 
shareholders to ensure it reaches the threshold.
Ryanair wins UK licence to keep flights running in no-deal Brexit Airlines
In November, Ryanair stirred anger among some of its pilots as it started to recruit for a UK subsidiary, established 
to protect the company against a nodeal Brexit.
Pilots said the salaries offered at the subsidiary undermined Ryanair's claims about how much they earn - which the 
airline has insisted would not be lower than those of pilots flying for the parent group and can be up to 
(EURO)200,000 (£178,000).
The news about its UK licence came as Ryanair faced three days of strikes this month from its Spanish cabin crew.
Unions SITCPLA and USO have scheduled industrial action on January 8, 10 and 13 after failing to reach an 
agreement with Ryanair on employing its members under local law, rather than Irish, as the airline does at the 
moment.
The unions said the airline's behaviour was "absurd and childish". Ryanair did not respond to a request for 
comment on the Spanish strikes.
The carrier has been engaged in negotiations with its unions since agreeing to recognise them in late 2017 after a 
rostering failure and staff shortage led to thousands of cancellations.
It faced several days of strikes last summer, causing the cancellation of thousands of flights.
Ryanair has been making gradual progress in resolving its industrial relations problems.
At the end of November, it signed a framework agreement with its German pilots ahead of a collective labour 
agreement early next year, and it has reached collective labour agreements with cabin crew in Germany, Belgium 
and Italy.

licences. Ryanair has tried to respond to the problem by preparing plans to take away voting rights from non-EU 
shareholders to ensure it meets the threshold. In November, Ryanair stirred up anger among some of its pilots as it 
started to recruit for a UK subsidiary, established to protect the company against a no-deal Brexit.

Low-cost carrier Ryanair has secured a UK operating licence, meaning the London listed and Dublin-based airline 
can continue domestic flights in the country and flights from Britain to outside the EU in the event of a no-deal 
Brexit.
Ryanair's chief legal and regulatory officer Juliusz Komorek warned that risks of a no-deal Brexit were rising and 
called for the UK and EU to agree a transition deal to avoid disruption to holidays in the summer.
The airline applied for the air operating certificate in late 2017. Its UK domestic routes only accounted for 1 per cent 
of capacity in 2018, according to its annual report, but it also flies from the UK to non-EU destinations including 
Morocco and Norway.
Hungary's Wizz Air obtained a UK operating licence in May 2018 for the same reason, while easyJet, a UK-based 
company, has been granted an Austrian operating licence to ensure European flights in the region can continue.

THE AVIATION regulator has granted budget airline Ryanair a UK air operator certificate that will allow it to operate 
flights within the UK and to non-EU routes in the event of a nodeal Brexit.
The Irish airline yesterday said the risk of a no-deal Brexit was rising and repeated its call for the UK and EU to 
agree a transition from 31 March - when Britain is formally set to leave the bloc - to avoid any summer holiday 
disruption.
Ryanair, which operates three domestic routes in the UK, applied for the certificate late in 2017.
Ryanair's passenger numbers increased by 12 per cent from 9.3m in 2017 to 10.3m last month, the airline said 
yesterday, including the 300,000 passengers that travelled on Niki Lauda's Laudamotion, which Ryanair acquired 
last year. However, passenger numbers for the 12 months through December rose eight per cent in 2018, two per 
cent down on 10 per cent growth in 2017.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.----------COMPANIES----------Next said trading in the key 
Christmas period came in line with the company's expectations, though the retailer lowered its annual profit 
guidance. Next, the first London-listed retailer to reveal its performance for the important festive trading period, said 
strong sales in the three weeks prior to Christmas along with a good half-term holiday week at the end of October 
made up for disappointing sales in November. For the period from October 28 to December 29, the retailer 
recorded full price sales growth of 1.0% on the year ago period, with online sales rising 15% and retail sales 
declining 9.2%. Total full price sales including interest income for the period grew 1.5% on the prior year, in line with 
the company's September guidance.----------Budget airline Ryanair said its traffic grew in December, while smaller 
peer Wizz Air experienced an even sharper rise. Ryanair said its December passengers totalled 10.3 million, up 
11% from 9.3 million passengers a year before. 
Its load factor remained unchanged at 95%. Wizz Air posted a 18% increase in passenger traffic to 2.660 million 
from 2.248 million the year before. Wizz Air's load factor increased 1.3 percentage points to 88.8% from 87.5% 
year-on-year and its capacity increased to 3.0 million seats from 2.6 million.----------Shares of US tech giant Apple 
plunged 7% in after-hours trade in New York on Wednesday after the tech giant lowered its first-quarter guidance. 
California-based Apple now expects first-quarter revenue of about USD84 billion, down from its prior estimate of 
between USD89 billion to USD93 billion. Apple now expects gross margin of about 38%, down from previous 
estimate of between 38% and 38.5%. Apple said it did not expect the magnitude of the economic deceleration in 
emerging markets, particularly in China. The company said most of its revenue shortfall to guidance, and over 
100% of year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in China across the iPhone, Mac and iPad products.--
--------Tesla Motors shares closed down 6.8% on Wednesday after missing market expectations for deliveries and 
announcing price cuts for its luxury electric cars. The steep drop comes after the firm, headed up by Elon Musk, 
reported fourth-quarter deliveries of 90,700 vehicles, up 8% from the third quarter but below analyst estimates for 
about 92,000. Tesla also said it is reducing the price of Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles in the US by 
USD2,000 to partially absorb a reduction of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles.----------MARKETS----------
Stocks in Europe were lower with US futures also pointing to a downbeat start after tech giant Apple, after Wall 
Street closed on Wednesday, fanned fears of an economic slowdown in China as it blamed the region for 
disappointing sales and cut its outlook. Retailers were the best performers in London after Next's reassuring

 Stock prices in London are set to open lower on Thursday after a volatile session on Wednesday, which saw the 
FTSE 100 rally from substantial early losses to close in the green.
However, sentiment was dented overnight by a downbeat outlook from iPhone maker Apple after the US market 
close. Apple blamed a weak Chinese market for its lower-than-expected sales, compounding fears over a slowdown 
in China after the world's second largest economy reported some weak manufacturing data earlier in the week.
In early company news, Next said Christmas sales were in line with forecasts but nudged down its annual profit 
guidance. Drugmaker Vectura said it expects to beat earnings consensus forecasts. Ryanair and Wizz Air both 
reported a rise in December passenger numbers. 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open down 35.63 points at 6,698.60 on Thursday. The 
index closed up 6.10 points, or 0.1%, at 6,734.23 on Wednesday after hitting a low of 6,599.48 in early dealings.
"European stock markets saw a major swing yesterday, and they endured a severe sell-off at the start of the 
session, but there was rally in the afternoon, and the FTSE 100 and DAX managed to end the day slightly in 
positive territory. The major US indices also saw a volatile session, whereby it also endured heavy losses initially, 
but managed to eke out a small gain in in the end," commented David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets.
He continued: "In after-hours trading on Wall Street, Apple lowered its first-quarter guidance due to weaker sales in 
China. The update sent the stock lower, and it put pressure on US index futures."
Apple shares shed nearly to 8% in post-market trade after the iPhone maker said it now expects first-quarter 
revenue of around USD84 billion, down from its prior estimate of between USD89 billion to USD93 billion.
Apple said it did not expect the magnitude of the economic deceleration in emerging markets, particularly in China. 
The company said most of its revenue shortfall compared to guidance, and over 100% of year-over-year worldwide 
revenue decline, occurred in China across its iPhone, Mac and iPad products.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Next Festive Sales In Line But Outlook Lowered
Worrying manufacturing data from China earlier on Wednesday and also on Monday had heightened fears over an 
economic slowdown, as the country's two manufacturing PMI scores both fell below the neutral mark of 50 into 
contraction.
In the US on Wednesday, prior to the Apple update, Wall Street had ended in positive territory, with the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average closing slightly higher, up 0.1%, the S&P 500 also up 0.1% and Nasdaq Composite rising 0.5%.
US futures are pointed to a sharply lower open on Thursday, however, with the Dow Jones pointed down 1.6%, the 
S&P 500 also down 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite - of which Apple is a constituent - down 2.6%.
In Asia on Thursday, markets in Japan remain closed. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed flat, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.2%.
In UK company news, Next nudged its annual profit guidance slightly lower as Christmas trading came in line with 
forecasts but with higher sales of seasonal products, squeezing margins. 
Full-price sales in the Christmas trading period were up 1.5% on last year, in line with guidance. Strong sales in the 
three weeks prior to Christmas helped to make up for a disappointing performance in November, the company said. 
For the full year, ending later in January, the company expects full price sales growth of 3.2%, in line with previous 
guidance. However, central guidance for full-year profit is now GBP723 million, 0.6% lower than previous guidance 
of GBP727 million. 
This difference is a result of two factors, the company said, the first being higher sales on seasonal lines, such as 
personalised gifts and beauty ranges. While these categories make a "healthy" net margin, it is lower than that 
achieved in clothing ranges and thus reduced profit by GBP1.5 million. 
The remaining GBP2.5 million gap between previous profit guidance and the new forecast was due to the increased 
operational costs associated with higher-than-expected Online sales, Next said. 
For the 2020 financial year, Next's full-price sales growth guidance is 1.7%, in line with the second half performance 
of its current financial year. Within this forecast, Retail sales are expected to fall 8.5% while Online sales are to rise 
11%. 
"Any sales forecast made in January comes with a high degree of uncertainty. This year uncertainty around the 
performance of the UK economy after Brexit makes forecasting particularly difficult. We have not factored into our 
sales estimates the potential benefits of a smooth transition or the downsides of a disorderly Brexit," the company 
noted. 
Budget carrier Wizz Air reported a rise in passengers and an improvement in load factor for December.
Passengers in December were up 18% on last year, while load factor improved 1.3 percentage points to 88.8% 
from 87.5%. Capacity for the month rose 17% to 3.0 million seats. 
Meanwhile, larger peer Ryanair reported 12% growth in passengers in December at 10.3 million. Load factor was 
unchanged at 95%.
Vectura said it expects annual revenue in line with market consensus but earnings to be "materially above".
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation is expected to be "materially" ahead of 
market consensus, which the company put down to revenue mix, productivity initiatives and margin improvements. 
Research & development investment for the full year is expected to be at, or around, the bottom of its GBP55 
million to GBP65 million guidance range. 
DNO said it has decided to extend its hostile takeover offer for Faroe Petroleum for another fortnight after receiving 
acceptances from just over 13% of the UK and Norway-focused oil and gas company's shares. 
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Next Festive Sales In Line But Outlook Lowered
DNO already owns just below a 30% stake in the company, taking the level of acceptances to 43%, below its 
acceptance condition of securing one share more than 57.5% of Faroe's share capital.
If the offer lapses, DNO warned it will not be able to make a new offer for another 12 months.
"Whether DNO achieves its acceptance condition or not, its goal will continue to be to safeguard DNO's significant 
investment in Faroe. DNO will redouble efforts to replace entrenched directors and achieve appropriate board 
representation for the owners of Faroe to achieve greater transparency and scrutiny," DNO added. 
Faroe - which has consistently deemed the offer "opportunistic" - on Wednesday published an independent 
valuation of its assets, of which the findings implied a valuation for Faroe itself in the range of 186 pence to 225p 
per share, representing a 22% to 48% premium to DNO's offer price of 152 pence.
In the economic calendar on Thursday is the UK's construction PMI, due at 0930 GMT. The reading is expected to 
come in at 52.9 for December, down from the 53.4 reported in November. 
In the US, private payroll processor ADP releases employment change figures for November at 1315 GMT, a 
precursor to Friday's monthly nonfarm payrolls report. 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May has been urged to delay the "meaningful vote" on her Brexit deal for a second 
time.
Former Brexit secretary David Davis has speculated the vote could be put off if May looks likely to lose it. The vote, 
which was delayed at the last minute in December, is currently scheduled for the week beginning January 14.
His comments come as the prime minister prepares to meet EU leaders and seek further "clarifications" in a bid to 
persuade sceptical MPs to back her deal.
She is expected to speak this week to EU leaders including German chancellor Angela Merkel, Dutch prime 
minister Mark Rutte and European Council president Donald Tusk in an attempt to break the Brexit logjam, the 
Financial Times has reported.
A Downing Street source told the Press Association that talks between May's negotiators and their counterparts in 
Brussels have continued over the Christmas period.
May's ongoing talks with her EU counterparts comes as the UK government launches a publicity drive to prepare 
the public for a possible no-deal Brexit.
Whitehall departments and the health regulator are to begin publishing guidance on how the public can get ready 
for potential issues that may arise from a disorderly break from Europe, the Brexit Secretary has said.

 The majority of the European markets ended Thursday's session in the red. 
Global growth concerns weighed on investor sentiment after US company Apple lowered its first quarter revenue 
forecast. The lower guidance was attributed to a significantly greater than expected impact from economic 
weakness in some emerging markets.
Disappointing US manufacturing data also contributed to the negative mood among investors. Traders are looking 
ahead to the release of the all important US jobs report on Friday.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened 1.0%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
decreased 1.3%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.6%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 1.6% and the CAC of France fell 1.7%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 0.6%, but 
the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.4%.
Chipmakers were under heavy pressure following the warning from Apple. AMS plunged 23% in Zurich, 
STMicroelectronics sank 12% in Paris and Dialog Semiconductor tumbled 9.7% in Frankfurt.
In Paris, drug giant Sanofi slid 1.0% after it decided not to extend its collaboration with MyoKardia beyond the initial 
research term, which ended on December 31.
In London, fashion retailer Next jumped 4.3%. The company cut its full year profit guidance, but posted strong sales 
in the three weeks prior to Christmas.
Acacia Mining shares advanced 3.9%. The new Barrick Gold Corp is considering options for its stake in the 
company including possible sale, Chief Executive Mark Bristow reportedly said.
Ryanair Holdings lost 1.7% after its passenger traffic increased 12% in December from a year ago.
European Markets Finish Mostly Lower After Apple Revenue Warning
Industrial equipment rental company Ashtead Group fell 2.3%. The company has extended the maturity of its senior 
credit facility to December 2023 and increased it to USD4.1 billion.
British construction sector growth was the weakest in three months in December amid a slower rise in commercial 
work, survey data from IHS Markit showed on Thursday. The CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, fell to 52.8 
from 53.4 in November. The latest reading was in line with economists' expectations.
Partly reflecting favorable weather, payroll processor ADP released a report on Thursday showing much stronger 
than expected US private sector job growth in the month of December. ADP said private sector employment surged 
up by 271,000 jobs in December after climbing by a downwardly revised 157,000 jobs in November.
Economists had expected an increase of about 178,000 jobs compared to the addition of 179,000 jobs originally 
reported for the previous month.
A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed a bigger than expected increase in first-time 
claims for US unemployment benefits in the week ended December 29. The report said initial jobless claims 
climbed to 231,000, an increase of 10,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 221,000.
Economists had expected jobless claims to edge up to 220,000 from the 216,000 originally reported for the previous 
month.
Indicating a notable slowdown in the pace of growth in US manufacturing activity in the month of December, the 
Institute for Supply Management released a report on Thursday showing a much bigger than expected drop by its 
index of activity in the manufacturing sector.
The ISM said its purchasing managers index tumbled to 54.1 in December after rising to 59.3 in November, 
slumping its lowest level since hitting 53.4 in November of 2016. While a reading above 50 still indicates growth in 
manufacturing activity, economists had expected the index to show a more modest drop to a reading of 57.9.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. stocks fell on Thursday as political instability in Washington 
and Apple's profit warning, citing a weakening economy in China and lower-than-expected iPhone revenue, added 
to investor concerns over slowing global growth.   A strong trading update by retailer Next helped limit overall losses 
to some extent.   The benchmark FTSE 100 was down 9 points or 0.13 percent at 6,725 in opening deals after 
rising 0.1 percent the previous day.   Resource stocks fell broadly, with miners Anglo American, Antofagasta and 
Glencore losing 1-2 percent.   Oil & gas exploration company Tullow Oil dropped 2 percent as oil prices declined on 
concerns over a surge in supply.   Fashion retailer Next jumped 5.2 percent. The company cut its full year profit 
guidance, but posted strong sales in the three weeks prior to Christmas.  Acacia Mining shares advanced 1.3 
percent. The new Barrick Gold Corp is considering options for its stake in the company including possible sale, 
CEO Mark Bristow reportedly said.   Ryanair Holdings gained 0.7 percent after its passenger traffic increased 12 
percent in December from a year ago.   Industrial equipment rental company Ashtead Group rose 0.8 percent. The 
company has extended the maturity of its senior credit facility to December 2023 and increased it to $4.1 billion.

AFTER a tumultuous year in the markets with Brexit uncertainty, the threat of trade war and rapidly changing 
consumer habits, the FTSE 100 was approaching the end of the year at least 12 per cent down. While there is no 
sign that 2019 will be any less eventful, with the date Britain is set to leave the EU fast approaching and Donald 
Trump still in the White House, the City A.M. editorial staff have picked a selection of stocks they hope will still fare 
well in the coming year.
ALEXANDRA ROGERS LAW, WHITE COLLAR CRIME AND TRANSPORT REPORTER Go Ahead Group: Go 
Ahead is just one of many train companies to have attracted little but bad press thanks to the timetable chaos in 
May. However, the firm seems to be making amends with the government and its shares have held firm in spite of 
the troubles. The company has also diversified beyond the UK market, with rail or bus wins in Germany, Ireland and 
Norway.
Ryanair: After a torrid year of industrial unrest, cancelled flights, concerns over Brexit and a profit warning last 
October, Ryanair may fall into the category of unloved, and perhaps unvalued, stocks. It may not take much for 
Ryanair to surprise on the upside.
AUGUST GRAHAM ENERGY AND MINING REPORTER Clas Ohlson: It may have closed almost all of its stores in 
the UK and several in Germany, but hardware specialist Clas Ohlson is still one to watch over the next year. Having 
just entered her second year in the post after joining from Ikea, chief executive Lotta Lyra will hope that pulling out 
of unprofitable markets will help the business in 2019.
TIPPED FOR GREATNESS; Jess Clark rounds up the top stock tips for the year ahead from the City A.M. 
team
Elan Oil and Gas: With a newly refinanced $75m (£59.6m) loan facility at its back, Eland Oil & Gas will look forward 
to another year of growth after its shares increased almost 50 per cent this year. Its low production costs help get it 
healthy netbacks and if oil prices recover after Opec's cuts that will also boost the share. At around 100p the stock 
is still undervalued and Peel Hunt puts its target price at 160p.
CALLUM KEOWN BANKING, ECONOMICS AND MARKETS REPORTER Go Compare: Go Compare shares have 
halved in the second half of this year but it could be a completely different year by comparison in 2019. The 
company, perhaps most famous for its adverts and jingles, launched its Weflip service to help customers switch 
energy provider in October, which should generate share price movement.
On the Beach: Travel operators will no doubt be under the spotlight again in 2019, particularly if the UK has another 
hot summer. On the Beach flourished this year amid the heatwave by being flexible and cutting marketing costs. It 
could be another strong year for the firm as other providers struggle.
EMILY NICOLLE TECHNOLOGY REPORTER Apple: After becoming the world's first trillion-dollar public company 
earlier this year, Apple's share price took a hit as Trump's trade war affected its ability to meet demand for its 
products. But the problem is a temporary one: if demand stays high, Apple will bounce back bigger and better than 
ever.
Tesla: Tesla has been one of tech's most volatile stocks this year, with share price fluctuations caused every time 
its eccentric boss Elon Musk goes on Twitter. But after hitting profitability last quarter and with new products in the 
pipeline, Tesla's future success as a business is looking brighter by the minute.
JAMES BOOTH CORPORATE LAW AND INSURANCE REPORTER Berkeley Group: Berkeley's bet on building 
houses in London looks a good one. Despite short term fluctuations in demand, London's demand for new 
residential property is voracious and current levels of construction are not doing enough to fill that need.
Burford Capital: Burford has set the benchmark for litigation funders, delivering consistently high returns and 
wowing investors. If it can continue to back the right cases next year it could be one to watch for 2019.
JAMES WARRINGTON TELECOMMUNICATIONS, MARKETING AND MEDIA REPORTER Comcast: As the dust 
begins to settle on Comcast's year of duels with Disney, the US conglomerate is emerging as a solid bet for 2019. 
While some eyebrows have been raised at the £30bn price tag for Sky, it's likely Comcast will reap the rewards of 
its move into the European market. S4 Capital: Sir Martin Sorrell has not wasted a second with S4 Capital. The 
WPP founder has already secured two acquisitions and poached top talent for the firm. The veteran ad boss says 
his new venture is a "peanut morphed into a coconut". Next year will determine just how large it grows.
JOE CURTIS DIGITAL EDITOR AJ Bell: Shares in broker and online trader AJ Bell soared after its IPO earlier this 
month, and its numbers suggest its stock could continue to climb in 2019. Bell is enjoying double digit growth 
across both its top and bottom lines, while its 25 per cent rise in assets under management outstripped the recent 
16 per cent rise seen by larger rival Hargreaves Lansdown, which went public more than a decade ago.
Microfocus: The London-listed IT firm looks ready to recover from a brutal year in which shares dived 44 per cent 
after a revenue warning related to its ill-fated £6.6bn purchase of HPE Software. With a new finance boss, the Suse 
sell-off complete, full-year revenue at the higher end of guidance and an extended share buyback scheme, 
enriching shareholders should be one New Year's resolution Micro Focus can expect to tick off.
JOSH MARTIN NIGHT EDITOR Thomas Cook: November and December have proved to be the holiday period 
from hell for package travel specialist Thomas Cook, so things can only get better in 2019. Borrowing a line usually 
reserved for fashion retailers, the company blamed the weather for its weak performance as the sunshine kept Brits 
on home turf over the summer. However, this is unlikely to be repeated to the same extent in 2019 and the 
company will benefit from decreased airline seat capacity on certain routes and passengers returning to former 
favourites Turkey and Egypt. Anglo American: Miners are a safer bet when looking for returns in a volatile Brexit 
environment as they are shielded from the weaker pound and fickle consumer spending. Anglo American looks to

team
be ahead of the pack and continues to raise guidance on production and margins (now due to be up by around 
three per cent in 2019), while costs reduce further. The De Beers diamonds owner will shine even brighter once the 
trade standoff between China and the US subsides and commodity prices strengthen.
LOUIS ASHWORTH PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REPORTER The New York Times: It may be called the Gray 
Lady, but the New York Times has seen a lot of green lately. Helped by a massive 'Trump bump' at the end of 
2016, it has rapidly increased digital subscriber numbers, and is growing revenue faster than many online giants.
Pearson: After several years in the doldrums, Pearson's turnaround after shedding several units seems properly 
underway. The publisher's price is gradually rising, and it is having some success in making its intellectual property 
work online - a signal that better times may be ahead.
LUKE GRAHAM FEATURES WRITER Disney: The House of Mouse looks set for a bumper 2019. Along with a 
slate of movies all likely to make billions at the box office, including Captain Marvel, Avengers: Endgame, and Toy 
Story 4, the company is set to launch Disney+, a Netflix-style streaming service. It is slowly pulling content from 
other streaming channels, so that its own may become the only place to stream classic Disney, Marvel and Star 
Wars films and related TV shows.
Jupiter Asset Management: Perhaps not a tip as such - JUP was the first individual stock I ever invested in. I bought 
into the company back in February, hooked by the appealing dividend and potential growth. Since then my 
investment is down 42 per cent. Here's hoping things improve in 2019.
MICHAEL SEARLES SPORTS REPORTER Amazon: The e-commerce giant has revolutionised distribution with its 
fulfilment services that allow businesses across the world to sell products with next -day delivery. Amazon Prime 
specifically has been a key part of its growth and under boss Jeff Bezos the company continue to compete on 
numerous fronts with its streaming services, innovative technology, and now food delivery too. Tencent: The tech 
giant continues to dominate the Chinese digital market with its own streaming services and also has shares in 
Tesla, Spotify and Snapchat. Despite a difficult year due to China's freeze on video game approvals, Tencent will 
look to bounce back in 2019 when approvals are set to be resumed with the online gaming industry continuing to 
grow at a rapid rate.
SEBASTIAN MCCARTHY RETAIL AND PROPERTY REPORTER Segro: Few FTSE firms have benefitted from the 
changing retail winds quite like Segro. While 2018 was a bleak year for many of the UK's high street retailers, 
industrial property developers like this one have seen profits soar, and there is little sign of a slowdown into 2019.
Ten Entertainment: The bowling operator has battled through fluctuations in the weather to deliver profits this year. 
Demand for its food, drink and leisure experiences has encouraged Ten Entertainment to expand its portfolio, and a 
number of analysts are feeling confident that the ten-pin bowling company is well-set for the year ahead.

Jan 02, 2019( Transcript Daily: https://transcriptdaily.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY)'s 
stock had its "hold" rating reaffirmed by Zacks Investment Research[1] in a research report issued to clients and 
investors on Monday. According to Zacks, "Ryanair is being aided by strong demand for air travel, especially due to 
low air fares. Notably, traffic in November rose 11% year over year. 
We are also impressed by Ryanair's efforts to reward shareholders in the form of share buybacks. In tune with this, 
the carrier returned more than €540 m to shareholders in the first six months of fiscal 2019. We remain positive on 
the collective deals signed by the company with German Pilot union. On the flip side, continued labor unrest is 
expected to hurt Ryanair's results in the fiscal third quarter. The stock has shed more than 33% of its value so far in 
the year mainly due to the labor unrest. Despite the current downtrend in oil prices, fuel costs are anticipated to 
dent bottom-line growth. Labor costs related to the labor deals inked with the Irish and German pilots also raise 
concerns."Several other analysts have also recently issued reports on the stock. BidaskClub cut shares of Ryanair

Dublin 2019: Wage stagnation holding back fares
AirFinance Journal

The aviation industry is over-leveraged and is struggling to raise fares, a senior economist has told Airfinance 
Journal’s Dublin 2019 Conference.
"There is a problem with debt,” said Vicky Pryce, former joint head of UK government economic service & board 
member,Centre for Economics & Business Research.
“In some cases, yes, the airlines have over-ordered, and costs were rather high and of course they over-borrowed."
Pryce adds that many airlines, including Ryanair, have become concerned at the difficulty of raising air fares due to 
competition and low wage growth.
She adds that although there has been growth since the financial crisis of 2008, average consumer incomes have 
not necessarily matched this growth, presenting a problems for low-fare airlines.
“In many countries, real incomes have been squeezed and squeezed,” Pryce says. “And of course you’re used to 
paying low fares so everyone is trying to raise fares in different ways by charging for extra things. The consumer is 
unwilling to spend a lot and we see that in the domestic markets in many European countries. Real incomes have 
not increased.”
However, Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend, thinks the industry has been bolstered by a diversification of 
markets since the global financial crisis.
“Initially, we had a time when it was pretty much the US and Europe. Now you are talking about US, Europe and 
China and to some extent Latin America is making a recovery too.”
As a result of increased cost pressures and airline consolidation, as well as legacy carriers trying to adopt LCC 
models, Pryce foresees the typical airline shifting towards a hybrid business model.
“I think we see a change taking place. I can’t quite forecast what the model will be in the future, but I am expecting it 
to be a hybrid model, much more than what we’ve seen so far. We’ve seen the beginnings already,” she says, 
referring to legacy airlines such as Lufthansa and Air Canada establishing LCCs.

Low-cost carriers (LLCs) are likely to continue to lead credit quality ratings, according to Michael Duff, managing 
director at the The Airline Analyst.
Data from Airfinance Journal Financial Ratings shows that the global credit quality index (CQI) from a sample of 
218 airlines has increased from around ‘B’ in 2008 to around ‘BB’ in 2018, according to weighted average by 
revenue. For simple average, the curve was on ‘B’ in 2008 and 2018, after peaking slightly in 2010.
In 2018, LCCs had the strongest CQI by business model, followed closely by leisure carriers, such as Jet2.com and 
Allegiant, according to the data. Regional airlines had the third-highest CQI, followed by network carriers and last, 
national carriers.
“I think the LCC business model is robust, particularly in our weighted assessment; we’ve got names like Ryanair, 
easyJet and Southwest that are bellwethers really and are clearly exposed to the strength of the economies, the 
most important factor in determining their success. I think the LCC segment will continue to lead the way,” said Duff.
Duff also notes that by region for the last decade, North American carriers have typically had the highest CQI, apart 
from between 2011 and 2013, when Asia-Pacific carriers also scored highly.
He adds: “What we’ve seen for the US carriers is a notch or two deterioration over the last 12 to 18 months. For the 
US carriers, credit stories are still positive, but we have seen a little bit of a tapering off in their performance over 
the last two or three years.”

Flybondi could add more aircraft this year

Argentina’s Flybondi is evaluating different scenarios regarding its fleet and could add capacity this year, according 
to its executive chairman Michael Powell.
The ultra-low-cost carrier launched operations a year ago and now operates five Boeing 737-800s.
Speaking on the sidelines of Airfinance Journal Dublin 2019, he says one 737-800 will be returned to its lessor in 
June this year and plans are underway to add one aircraft to the fleet.
“We could end 2019 with three additional aircraft,” he adds.
Powell says Flybondi stopped expansion plans last year and as a result ended with five aircraft instead of a fleet of 
10 Boeing 737-800s.
Lower interest rates in Argentina would help ultra low-cost carrier Flybondi to trade "a lot better than it's been able 
to until now" he says.
"The prospect of a higher dollar interest rate has already made a pretty substantial impact in Argentina," says 
Powell adding that the local interest rates have been “as high as 70%”. We're certainly looking forward to those 
interest rates coming down."
He added that lower interest rates would signify an improving economy in Argentina.
He says Flybondi will start hedging fuel over the next 12 months, although he admits that fuel hedging “smooth out 
volatility”.
“High fuel prices will virtually translate in higher fares and we believe in a wash through to fares with a lag.”
Powell says the cost per seat at Flybondi is lower than Ryanair.

The UK Civil Aviation Authority has awarded Ryanair UK - the Dublin-based airline's British unit - an air operator's 
certificate (AOC).
The AOC will allow Ryanair to continue operating domestic UK flights and flights between the UK and non-EU 
countries whatever the outcome of Brexit negotiations.
"The risk of a 'no deal' Brexit in March is rising, and despite our robust post-Brexit structures, including our post-
Brexit plan around European ownership, we continue to call for the UK and EU to agree a transition deal from 
March 31," said Ryanair's chief legal officer, Juliusz Komorek.

Ryanair expects lower profits but rival shake-out

Ryanair has lowered it 2018/19 profit guidance again, to &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.1 billion after tax - up to a quarter 
lower than its original estimate.
The low-cost carrier blamed pricing pressure over the winter season.
“While we are disappointed at this slightly lower full year guidance, the fact that it is the direct result of lower than 
expected H2 air fares, offset by stronger than expected traffic growth, a better than expected performance on unit 
cost and ancillary sales is positive for the medium term," said CEO Michael O'Leary.
After posting net profit of &euro;1.45 billion for 2017/18, Ryanair forecast &euro;1.25 billion to &euro;1.35 billion for 
the current financial year, but lowered this to &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.2 billion in October following extensive 
strike action among its crew.
The airline does not appear unduly concerned by the latest reduction, mainly because its traffic is up and because it 
believes that low fares will cause several more failures among its competitors in 2019.
Ryanair's 2018/19 profit guidance exclude an estimated &euro;140 million of exceptional start-up costs from its 
Laudamotion operation.

Ryanair is stepping up its expansion plans for Laudamotion, which became a 100% subsidiary of the Dublin-based 
carrier in December.
Having previously indicated that Laudamotion's fleet would rise to 18 aircraft in summer 2019, plans now envisage 
25 aircraft operating this summer.
The company has also signed letters of intent with several lessors to take Laudamotion's fleet to 30 aircraft for the 
summer 2020 season.
The goal is to more than double the Vienna-based carrier's traffic to 10 million passengers per annum within the 
next three years.
"As other airlines falter, close bases or put themselves up for sale (as in the case of Germania recently), we are 
inundated with applications from pilots and cabin crew," said Laudamotion deputy chief executive officer Colin 
Casey.

Herb Kelleher, the founder of Southwest Airlines and, arguably, the low-cost airline operating model, has died aged 
87.
Southwest started operations in 1971 and in the intervening period became the most consistently profitable airline 
in history. Last year is set to be its 46th consecutive year of profit.
Parts of the Southwest template were imported to Europe by Ryanair in the 1990s, although the latter chose to 
focus on costs rather Southwest's famously affable customer service - a folksy approach that could be traced 
directly to Kelleher's influence.
"His vision for making air travel affordable for all revolutionised the industry, and you can still see that 
transformation taking place today," said Gary Kelly, who became CEO of Southwest in 2004, three years after 
Kelleher had stepped down from the role.
Kelly added: "He inspired people; he motivated people; he challenged people—and, he kept us laughing all the 
way."

When the trade body for the world's airlines published its predictions for 2019, they came at the end of a patchy 
year for the industry of high oil prices, airline failures and a growing trade war between China and the US. 
Nonetheless, the International Air Transport Association forecasts next year will be a tenth consecutive year of 
profitability - the longest run for decades.
Iata forecast that net profit across the industry will be $35.5bn, up 9.9 per cent on 2018, although down on 2017's 
peak of $37.7bn. It also forecast record revenues of $885bn and passenger numbers at 4.6bn, a 5.6 per cent 
increase on 2018.
Alexandre de Juniac, Iata's director-general and chief executive, said: "We are cautiously optimistic that the run of 
solid value creation for investors will continue for at least another year. But there are downside risks as the 
economic and political environments remain volatile."
Iata predicted Brent crude would average out at $65 a barrel next year but the industry's fuel bill will still rise, from 
$180bn this year to $200bn next year, while remaining constant as a share of expenses.
Alex Paterson, analyst at Investec, praised measures to reduce excess capacity to allow airlines to maintain fares. 
"What we're encouraged by is that capacity growth accelerated during the year but has come back to a more 
manageable level because of the action of 50 or so airlines all slightly reducing their capacity for winter." But there 
were problems from 2018 that could recur, Mr Paterson said, such as flight disruption because of air traffic 
controller strikes and shortages, and industrial action at airlines including Ryanair and Air France.
Carriers plot steady course but cost pressures remain Airlines
The strong global economy also has its downside, said Brian Pearce, Iata's chief economist: "Although fuel prices 
have fallen, the industry is facing significantly rising costs elsewhere." Those pressures may lead to more 
consolidation in 2019.

It was midday on October 1 when Anders Ludvigsson found out that Primera, the small European airline he worked 
for, had just 12 hours before it was due to declare itself bankrupt. There was a mid-afternoon meeting where office 
staff were told, and five minutes later the news leaked to crew members through WhatsApp and Facebook. Flights 
ceased at midnight.
"We had been in trouble since I joined," says Mr Ludvigsson, a former director of flight operations who had started 
at Primera in 2006 as a pilot. "There was always some sort of crisis coming up."
The financial crisis, tumbling eurozone economies, the soaring oil price: Europe's airlines have not been immune to 
shocks in the past decade, least of all the smaller ones.
Like a lot of low-cost carriers, Primera prided itself on its nimble business model, which gave it an advantage over 
older airlines. "We could open up small bases with the same quality, without having infrastructure in place," says Mr 
Ludvigsson. "We opened and closed routes very freely. If they didn't work out, we closed them." But that flexibility 
could not protect it from unexpected blows, including corrosion on one of its aircraft and delayed deliveries of 
others.
Winter blues hit Europe's airlines European airlines have boomed over the past decade as low-cost carriers

Then Primera ran into a new wave of problems. At the same time as cancelled flights over the summer required 
passenger compensation, jet fuel was nearly double the price of the previous year. The airline had needed to risk 
expanding, he says, because "being static is slowly shrinking". But it was "a gamble that didn't come off".
With the Christmas travel season in full swing, a number of other airlines in Europe are facing similar dilemmas. 
They have tried to expand rapidly in a market that has seen a flurry of new entrants and different business models.
Europe's consumers have enjoyed the benefits of a booming aviation industry, with the number of flights rising by 
44 per cent to 38.1m in 2018 from a decade ago, according to the International Air Transport Association, and fares 
falling as low-cost carriers flourished across the continent. Ryanair's average ticket price, for example, fell from 
(EURO)45 in 2012 to (EURO)39.40 in 2018.
But that success has started to breed its own problems for airlines as troubles ranging from a higher oil price to 
congested skies start to pick off the weaker carriers. Behind them stand Europe's largest airlines, keen to 
consolidate and strengthen their grip on the market. Events like last week's closure of the UK's Gatwick airport after 
drones were sighted in the area, leaving thousands of passengers stranded, will not help.
Winter is a "horrendous" period for airlines, when a seasonal lull means that receipts are low but bills are high, says 
Gert Zonneveld, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. "When airlines go bust, they tend to go bust towards the end of the 
year … because that's when the cash balances are the lowest."
The struggle for some is to survive until spring, when bookings increase.
Fuel and compensation concerns The first big warning sign appeared last year, when three large European carriers 
went bankrupt in quick succession: Monarch in the UK; Air Berlin; and Alitalia. The last of these is still flying with the 
backing of the Italian government, potentially contravening EU state aid rules, but it awaits a new owner.
This autumn, a number of smaller airlines failed. As well as Latvia-based Primera, Cobalt of Cyprus, Germany's 
Azurair, Lithuania's Small Planet Airlines and the Swiss SkyWork all went out of business.
Two further carriers have had precarious experiences: UK regional airline Flybe, which put itself up for sale in 
November after poor results, and Iceland's Wow Air, which hastily agreed to a takeover by Icelandair only for it to 
fall through and a private equity buyer to step in. Norwegian has also had a volatile time, rebuffing takeover offers 
from IAG, owner of British Airways.
Aviation experts believe that the pressure on the sector is only going to intensify, as seasonal factors combine with 
macroeconomic problems.
The high price of jet fuel is a recurrent factor in the recent bankruptcies. Although the price has recently fallen back 
to around $75 a barrel, it has spent most of the year between $80 and $90 and came close to $100 in early 
October. Back in 2017, it had been as low as $50.
S&P Global Platts, a data provider, has estimated that the elevated price has added $48.6bn to airlines' 2018 fuel 
bill, compared with last year.
Airlines have also cited the costs of repaying passengers for cancelled and delayed flights as a result of new 
European compensation regulations. Jozsef Varadi, chief executive of Hungarybased Wizz Air, now one of 
Europe's "big six" airlines, blames the "squeeze in the marketplace" on both fuel costs and the new compensation 
system. "Those who are not viable from a financial standpoint cannot live up to the challenge," he adds The 
industry faced a big bill for the disruption caused by congestion over Europe's skies this summer - the worst on 
record. In July, Europe's travellers experienced more than 135,000 minutes of in-flight delays on average each day. 
Put another way, that was 94 days' worth of delays every day - more than double the year before.
Industrial action by French air traffic controllers and ground-handling staff, as well as a lack of air traffic control 
capacity and extreme weather - from the "Beast from the East" snowstorms in February to summer's heatwave - all 
Winter blues hit Europe's airlines European airlines have boomed over the past decade as low-cost carriers

contributed to these delays. Individual airlines added their own problems: Ryanair had to deal with days of strikes 
by pilots and cabin crew as part of a continent-wide industrial dispute.
Michel Dembinski, who is regional head of aviation in Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's structured finance office, 
says the industry is paying attention to "a number of indicators in a 'heat map' to monitor changes", including 
interest rates, aircraft lease rates and fuel costs. "If they start showing too much stress, an adverse reaction may 
lead to restrictions in capital liquidity and weaker cash flows for airlines. The weaker airlines will be the first 
impacted." Jarrod Castle, analyst at UBS, believes a turn in the cycle is not far off. "Airlines' valuations are saying 
we're going into another financial crisis," he says.
Icelandic saga The fate of one airline has played out very publicly. When Icelandair announced it wanted to 
takeover its national rival, Wow Air, in an all-stock deal worth $25m, at the start of November, it already seemed like 
a comedown for Wow, whose founder had said he was expecting to raise $200m-$300m in an initial public offering 
within 18 months.
At the time, the industry was still heralding Wow, which won the title of lowcost airline of the year at the Centre for 
Aviation awards in Berlin in November. Announcing the prize, Capa's executive chairman, Peter Harbison, said: "It 
is a mark of Wow Air's success that its biggest and closest competitor's only response is to buy it."
The airline was praised "for pioneering the long-haul, low-cost" model, using its Reykjavik hub to connect 20 
destinations in Europe and North America. However, some of those routes are lossmaking, given Wow's low fares. 
It will charge, for example, £130 to fly from New York Newark to London Gatwick from January, though its business 
model expects that passengers will add pricier "ancillaries" such as carry-on bags and extra legroom.
But two days after the ceremony, Icelandair cancelled the deal, having received a due diligence report on Wow. 
Bogi Nils Bogason, chief executive of Icelandair Group, said the result was "certainly disappointing", while Skuli 
Mogensen, Wow's chief executive and founder, said it had been a "challenging project". Icelandair's own shares fell 
almost a quarter in the following week.
The deal's collapse put Wow at risk, given that it had already announced a profit warning in a letter to bondholders 
and complained about creditors "demanding stricter payment terms than before, further putting pressure on our 
cash flow". It had issued (EURO)60m of bonds in September but with a high interest rate of 9 per cent.
In the letter, Mr Mogensen indicated how precarious Wow's survival was, saying "funding initiatives" had become "a 
necessity for the business" on top of the bonds. He said he had invested (EURO)5.5m cash in the bond "as I was 
convinced the funding would be sufficient to take us to an IPO in the next 18 months", but the airline needed more 
money.
The day after the deal collapsed, private equity firm Indigo Partners, which already owns Hungary's Wizz Air and 
Mexico's Volaris Airlines, offered to invest in Wow. The parties did not disclose terms, except to say Mr Mogensen 
would remain the principal shareholder.
The announcement could not have come at a better time for Wow. Mr Mogensen "really desperately needs to be 
able to put out some news like that, that somebody else is coming in", says one Icelandic analyst.
Flight to consolidation When airlines fail, their brands may disappear but their assets are often snapped up by 
stronger players - and consolidation is something Europe's bigger airlines are keen to see.
In the US, after mergers, acquisitions and the failure of smaller rivals, four airlines control 80 per cent of the 
domestic market by seats; in Europe, by contrast, even the top 10 airline groups can only muster 70 per cent. North 
American airlines have reaped the benefit of this consolidation: their margins for earnings before interest and tax 
have gone from 3.4 per cent in 2012 to 11 per cent in 2017, according to Iata. In Europe, that was 0.7 per cent in 
2012 and 6.9 per cent last year.
Winter blues hit Europe's airlines European airlines have boomed over the past decade as low-cost carriers 
have opened up new routes. But facing higher fuel cos....
Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, says the industry is reaching a cyclical peak and "smaller airlines will fail 
more rapidly over the next two years", given their bloated fuel bills, creating "consolidation opportunities in the 
European sector".
Mr Castle at UBS says there is a coherence to consolidation. "It's not like the capacity doesn't get redeployed in 
some manner when things improve. Slots get taken over. The planes might go somewhere else. What you do see 
after each downturn is more consolidation of profits: the big ones get stronger."
Consolidation helps solve one problem: overcapacity. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Europe's low-cost carriers 
planned to increase the number of seats by 11 per cent, and the continent's overall seat count by 7.7 per cent. 
Those numbers are actually decreases on previous plans: airline after airline announced it would grow more slowly, 
allowing it to protect its yields and pass on some of the higher fuel bills.
"If you look at the European market, there's too much supply," says Mark Manduca, an analyst at Citi. "We see the 
small guys looking for working capital, deferred revenue, prepayments, cash on the balance sheet."
Carsten Spohr, chief executive of Lufthansa, told the Financial Times in November that the airline industry needed 
to give up the "fantasy of growth going on forever" after a summer of strikes, delays and cancellations.
He says aviation capacity in Europe, measured by the number of seats, had increased about 6 per cent a year 
since 2016. This exceeds the industry's broad guide for sustainable growth of twice gross domestic product, which 
has recently been 2 per cent in Europe.
Problems with airspace, airports and delivery of aircraft show that "this industry has reached its maximum growth 
rate", says Mr Spohr. "What we need is healthy growth in line with infrastructure and manufacturers' capacity and 
airline capacity.
"We can't excuse ourselves, we are part of it."
'Zombie airlines'
How to spot the signs of vulnerable carriers
It is not easy to predict which airlines will fail, but there are characteristics industry observers look out for: weak 
balance sheets, high costs, ageing fleets. UBS analyst Jarrod Castle calls some of them "zombie airlines" which 
"seem to survive for a lot longer than anyone believes they will". Some benefit from state support, others have 
private owners who are prepared to invest in the hope of an upturn.
Wizz Air's Jozsef Váradi says "irrationalities" allow unlikely carriers to survive. "If you look at it from a central and 
eastern European perspective, you have a bunch of small national incumbents who haven't made money, who'll 
never make money, but are still going because the governments believe they need a national carrier for some 
reason."
Within Europe, the strongest players are legacy carriers such as IAG (owner of British Airways), the Lufthansa 
Group and Air France-KLM or the bigger lowcost carriers like Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz. Daniel Roeska at 
Bernstein argues that Europe's leading airlines are "far more resilient today than they previously were" and could 
capitalise on "disruptive opportunities" in a downturn.
Consolidation has certainly been on the agenda for these airlines. IAG won Monarch's Gatwick slots in 2017 and 
took a small stake in Norwegian, a rival on its transatlantic routes, earlier this year as a prelude to a takeover, but 
had its offers rebuffed.
Lufthansa and easyJet took over different units and routes of Air Berlin, while both have been interested in 
acquiring Alitalia.
Winter blues hit Europe's airlines European airlines have boomed over the past decade as low-cost carriers

However, Mr Roeska says Americanstyle consolidation is "a topic for the next 10 years", and strict ownership rules 
meant global dealmaking would take the form of "partnerships, joint ventures and equity stakes", rather than 
mergers and acquisitions.

to around $75 a barrel, it has spent most of the year between $80 and $90 and came close to $100 in early 
October. Back in 2017, it had been as low as $50.
S&P Global Platts, a data provider, has estimated that the elevated price has added $48.6bn to airlines' 2018 fuel 
bill, compared with last year.
Airlines have also cited the costs of repaying passengers for cancelled and delayed flights as a result of new 
European compensation regulations. Jozsef Varadi, chief executive of Hungarybased Wizz Air, now one of 
Europe's "big six" airlines, blames the "squeeze in the marketplace" on both fuel costs and the new compensation 
system. "Those who are not viable from a financial standpoint cannot live up to the challenge," he adds The 
industry faced a big bill for the disruption caused by congestion over Europe's skies this summer - the worst on 
record. In July, Europe's travellers experienced more than 135,000 minutes of in-flight delays on average each day. 
Put another way, that was 94 days' worth of delays every day - more than double the year before.
Industrial action by French air traffic controllers and ground-handling staff, as well as a lack of air traffic control 
capacity and extreme weather - from the "Beast from the East" snowstorms in February to summer's heatwave - all

contributed to these delays. Individual airlines added their own problems: Ryanair had to deal with days of strikes 
by pilots and cabin crew as part of a continent-wide industrial dispute.
Michel Dembinski, who is regional head of aviation in Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's structured finance office, 
says the industry is paying attention to "a number of indicators in a 'heat map' to monitor changes", including 
interest rates, aircraft lease rates and fuel costs. "If they start showing too much stress, an adverse reaction may 
lead to restrictions in capital liquidity and weaker cash flows for airlines. The weaker airlines will be the first 
impacted." Jarrod Castle, analyst at UBS, believes a turn in the cycle is not far off. "Airlines' valuations are saying 
we're going into another financial crisis," he says.
Icelandic saga The fate of one airline has played out very publicly. When Icelandair announced it wanted to 
takeover its national rival, Wow Air, in an all-stock deal worth $25m, at the start of November, it already seemed like 
a comedown for Wow, whose founder had said he was expecting to raise $200m-$300m in an initial public offering 
within 18 months.
At the time, the industry was still heralding Wow, which won the title of lowcost airline of the year at the Centre for 
Aviation awards in Berlin in November. Announcing the prize, Capa's executive chairman, Peter Harbison, said: "It 
is a mark of Wow Air's success that its biggest and closest competitor's only response is to buy it."
The airline was praised "for pioneering the long-haul, low-cost" model, using its Reykjavik hub to connect 20 
destinations in Europe and North America. However, some of those routes are lossmaking, given Wow's low fares. 
It will charge, for example, £130 to fly from New York Newark to London Gatwick from January, though its business 
model expects that passengers will add pricier "ancillaries" such as carry-on bags and extra legroom.
But two days after the ceremony, Icelandair cancelled the deal, having received a due diligence report on Wow. 
Bogi Nils Bogason, chief executive of Icelandair Group, said the result was "certainly disappointing", while Skuli 
Mogensen, Wow's chief executive and founder, said it had been a "challenging project". Icelandair's own shares fell 
almost a quarter in the following week.
The deal's collapse put Wow at risk, given that it had already announced a profit warning in a letter to bondholders 
and complained about creditors "demanding stricter payment terms than before, further putting pressure on our 
cash flow". It had issued (EURO)60m of bonds in September but with a high interest rate of 9 per cent.
In the letter, Mr Mogensen indicated how precarious Wow's survival was, saying "funding initiatives" had become "a 
necessity for the business" on top of the bonds. He said he had invested (EURO)5.5m cash in the bond "as I was 
convinced the funding would be sufficient to take us to an IPO in the next 18 months", but the airline needed more 
money.
The day after the deal collapsed, private equity firm Indigo Partners, which already owns Hungary's Wizz Air and 
Mexico's Volaris Airlines, offered to invest in Wow. The parties did not disclose terms, except to say Mr Mogensen 
would remain the principal shareholder.
The announcement could not have come at a better time for Wow. Mr Mogensen "really desperately needs to be 
able to put out some news like that, that somebody else is coming in", says one Icelandic analyst.
Flight to consolidation When airlines fail, their brands may disappear but their assets are often snapped up by 
stronger players - and consolidation is something Europe's bigger airlines are keen to see.
In the US, after mergers, acquisitions and the failure of smaller rivals, four airlines control 80 per cent of the 
domestic market by seats; in Europe, by contrast, even the top 10 airline groups can only muster 70 per cent. North 
American airlines have reaped the benefit of this consolidation: their margins for earnings before interest and tax 
have gone from 3.4 per cent in 2012 to 11 per cent in 2017, according to Iata. In Europe, that was 0.7 per cent in 
2012 and 6.9 per cent last year.
Winter blues hit Europe's airlines European airlines have boomed over the past decade as low-cost carriers 
have opened up new routes. But facing higher fuel cos....
Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, says the industry is reaching a cyclical peak and "smaller airlines will fail 
more rapidly over the next two years", given their bloated fuel bills, creating "consolidation opportunities in the 
European sector".
Mr Castle at UBS says there is a coherence to consolidation. "It's not like the capacity doesn't get redeployed in 
some manner when things improve. Slots get taken over. The planes might go somewhere else. What you do see 
after each downturn is more consolidation of profits: the big ones get stronger."
Consolidation helps solve one problem: overcapacity. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Europe's low-cost carriers 
planned to increase the number of seats by 11 per cent, and the continent's overall seat count by 7.7 per cent. 
Those numbers are actually decreases on previous plans: airline after airline announced it would grow more slowly, 
allowing it to protect its yields and pass on some of the higher fuel bills.
"If you look at the European market, there's too much supply," says Mark Manduca, an analyst at Citi. "We see the 
small guys looking for working capital, deferred revenue, prepayments, cash on the balance sheet."
Carsten Spohr, chief executive of Lufthansa, told the Financial Times in November that the airline industry needed 
to give up the "fantasy of growth going on forever" after a summer of strikes, delays and cancellations.
He says aviation capacity in Europe, measured by the number of seats, had increased about 6 per cent a year 
since 2016. This exceeds the industry's broad guide for sustainable growth of twice gross domestic product, which 
has recently been 2 per cent in Europe.
Problems with airspace, airports and delivery of aircraft show that "this industry has reached its maximum growth 
rate", says Mr Spohr. "What we need is healthy growth in line with infrastructure and manufacturers' capacity and 
airline capacity.
"We can't excuse ourselves, we are part of it."
'Zombie airlines' How to spot the signs of vulnerable carriers It is not easy to predict which airlines will fail, but there 
are characteristics industry observers look out for: weak balance sheets, high costs, ageing fleets. UBS analyst 
Jarrod Castle calls some of them "zombie airlines" which "seem to survive for a lot longer than anyone believes 
they will". Some benefit from state support, others have private owners who are prepared to invest in the hope of an 
upturn.
Wizz Air's Jozsef Váradi says "irrationalities" allow unlikely carriers to survive. "If you look at it from a central and 
eastern European perspective, you have a bunch of small national incumbents who haven't made money, who'll 
never make money, but are still going because the governments believe they need a national carrier for some 
reason."
Within Europe, the strongest players are legacy carriers such as IAG (owner of British Airways), the Lufthansa 
Group and Air France-KLM or the bigger lowcost carriers like Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz. Daniel Roeska at 
Bernstein argues that Europe's leading airlines are "far more resilient today than they previously were" and could 
capitalise on "disruptive opportunities" in a downturn.
Consolidation has certainly been on the agenda for these airlines. IAG won Monarch's Gatwick slots in 2017 and 
took a small stake in Norwegian, a rival on its transatlantic routes, earlier this year as a prelude to a takeover, but 
had its offers rebuffed.
Lufthansa and easyJet took over different units and routes of Air Berlin, while both have been interested in 
acquiring Alitalia.
However, Mr Roeska says Americanstyle consolidation is "a topic for the next 10 years", and strict ownership rules 
meant global dealmaking would take the form of "partnerships, joint ventures and equity stakes", rather than 
mergers and acquisitions.

It was midday on October 1 when Anders Ludvigsson found out that Primera, the small European airline he worked 
for, had just 12 hours before it was due to declare itself bankrupt. There was a mid-afternoon meeting where office 
staff were told, and five minutes later the news leaked to crew members through WhatsApp and Facebook. Flights 
ceased at midnight.
"We had been in trouble since I joined," says Mr Ludvigsson, a former director of flight operations who had started 
at Primera in 2006 as a pilot. "There was always some sort of crisis coming up."
The financial crisis, tumbling eurozone economies, the soaring oil price: Europe's airlines have not been immune to 
shocks in the past decade, least of all the smaller ones.
Like a lot of low-cost carriers, Primera prided itself on its nimble business model, which gave it an advantage over 
older airlines. "We could open up small bases with the same quality, without having infrastructure in place," says Mr 
Ludvigsson. "We opened and closed routes very freely. If they didn't work out, we closed them." But that flexibility 
could not protect it from unexpected blows, including corrosion on one of its aircraft and delayed deliveries of 
others.
Winter blues hit Europe's airlines European airlines have boomed over the past decade as low-cost carriers

Then Primera ran into a new wave of problems. At the same time as cancelled flights over the summer required 
passenger compensation, jet fuel was nearly double the price of the previous year. The airline had needed to risk 
expanding, he says, because "being static is slowly shrinking". But it was "a gamble that didn't come off".
With the Christmas travel season in full swing, a number of other airlines in Europe are facing similar dilemmas. 
They have tried to expand rapidly in a market that has seen a flurry of new entrants and different business models.
Europe's consumers have enjoyed the benefits of a booming aviation industry, with the number of flights rising by 
44 per cent to 38.1m in 2018 from a decade ago, according to the International Air Transport Association, and fares 
falling as low-cost carriers flourished across the continent. Ryanair's average ticket price, for example, fell from 
(EURO)45 in 2012 to (EURO)39.40 in 2018.
But that success has started to breed its own problems for airlines as troubles ranging from a higher oil price to 
congested skies start to pick off the weaker carriers. Behind them stand Europe's largest airlines, keen to 
consolidate and strengthen their grip on the market. Events like last week's closure of the UK's Gatwick airport after 
drones were sighted in the area, leaving thousands of passengers stranded, will not help.
Winter is a "horrendous" period for airlines, when a seasonal lull means that receipts are low but bills are high, says 
Gert Zonneveld, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. "When airlines go bust, they tend to go bust towards the end of the 
year ... because that's when the cash balances are the lowest."
The struggle for some is to survive until spring, when bookings increase.
Fuel and compensation concerns The first big warning sign appeared last year, when three large European carriers 
went bankrupt in quick succession: Monarch in the UK; Air Berlin; and Alitalia. The last of these is still flying with the 
backing of the Italian government, potentially contravening EU state aid rules, but it awaits a new owner.
This autumn, a number of smaller airlines failed. As well as Latvia-based Primera, Cobalt of Cyprus, Germany's 
Azurair, Lithuania's Small Planet Airlines and the Swiss SkyWork all went out of business.
Two further carriers have had precarious experiences: UK regional airline Flybe, which put itself up for sale in 
November after poor results, and Iceland's Wow Air, which hastily agreed to a takeover by Icelandair only for it to 
fall through and a private equity buyer to step in. Norwegian has also had a volatile time, rebuffing takeover offers 
from IAG, owner of British Airways.
Aviation experts believe that the pressure on the sector is only going to intensify, as seasonal factors combine with 
macroeconomic problems.
The high price of jet fuel is a recurrent factor in the recent bankruptcies. Although the price has recently fallen back 
to around $75 a barrel, it has spent most of the year between $80 and $90 and came close to $100 in early

Michel Dembinski, who is regional head of aviation in Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's structured finance office, 
says the industry is paying attention to "a number of indicators in a 'heat map' to monitor changes", including 
interest rates, aircraft lease rates and fuel costs. "If they start showing too much stress, an adverse reaction may 
lead to restrictions in capital liquidity and weaker cash flows for airlines. The weaker airlines will be the first 
impacted." Jarrod Castle, analyst at UBS, believes a turn in the cycle is not far off. "Airlines' valuations are saying 
we're going into another financial crisis," he says.
Icelandic saga The fate of one airline has played out very publicly. When Icelandair announced it wanted to 
takeover its national rival, Wow Air, in an all-stock deal worth $25m, at the start of November, it already seemed like 
a comedown for Wow, whose founder had said he was expecting to raise $200m-$300m in an initial public offering 
within 18 months.
At the time, the industry was still heralding Wow, which won the title of lowcost airline of the year at the Centre for 
Aviation awards in Berlin in November. Announcing the prize, Capa's executive chairman, Peter Harbison, said: "It 
is a mark of Wow Air's success that its biggest and closest competitor's only response is to buy it."
The airline was praised "for pioneering the long-haul, low-cost" model, using its Reykjavik hub to connect 20 
destinations in Europe and North America. However, some of those routes are lossmaking, given Wow's low fares. 
It will charge, for example, £130 to fly from New York Newark to London Gatwick from January, though its business 
model expects that passengers will add pricier "ancillaries" such as carry-on bags and extra legroom.
But two days after the ceremony, Icelandair cancelled the deal, having received a due diligence report on Wow. 
Bogi Nils Bogason, chief executive of Icelandair Group, said the result was "certainly disappointing", while Skuli 
Mogensen, Wow's chief executive and founder, said it had been a "challenging project". Icelandair's own shares fell 
almost a quarter in the following week.
The deal's collapse put Wow at risk, given that it had already announced a profit warning in a letter to bondholders 
and complained about creditors "demanding stricter payment terms than before, further putting pressure on our 
cash flow". It had issued (EURO)60m of bonds in September but with a high interest rate of 9 per cent.
In the letter, Mr Mogensen indicated how precarious Wow's survival was, saying "funding initiatives" had become "a 
necessity for the business" on top of the bonds. He said he had invested (EURO)5.5m cash in the bond "as I was 
convinced the funding would be sufficient to take us to an IPO in the next 18 months", but the airline needed more 
money.
The day after the deal collapsed, private equity firm Indigo Partners, which already owns Hungary's Wizz Air and 
Mexico's Volaris Airlines, offered to invest in Wow. The parties did not disclose terms, except to say Mr Mogensen 
would remain the principal shareholder.
The announcement could not have come at a better time for Wow. Mr Mogensen "really desperately needs to be 
able to put out some news like that, that somebody else is coming in", says one Icelandic analyst.
Flight to consolidation When airlines fail, their brands may disappear but their assets are often snapped up by 
stronger players - and consolidation is something Europe's bigger airlines are keen to see.
Winter blues hit Europe's airlines European airlines have boomed over the past decade as low-cost carriers 
have opened up new routes. But facing higher fuel cos....
In the US, after mergers, acquisitions and the failure of smaller rivals, four airlines control 80 per cent of the 
domestic market by seats; in Europe, by contrast, even the top 10 airline groups can only muster 70 per cent. North 
American airlines have reaped the benefit of this consolidation: their margins for earnings before interest and tax 
have gone from 3.4 per cent in 2012 to 11 per cent in 2017, according to Iata. In Europe, that was 0.7 per cent in 
2012 and 6.9 per cent last year.
Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, says the industry is reaching a cyclical peak and "smaller airlines will fail 
more rapidly over the next two years", given their bloated fuel bills, creating "consolidation opportunities in the 
European sector".
Mr Castle at UBS says there is a coherence to consolidation. "It's not like the capacity doesn't get redeployed in 
some manner when things improve. Slots get taken over. The planes might go somewhere else. What you do see 
after each downturn is more consolidation of profits: the big ones get stronger."
Consolidation helps solve one problem: overcapacity. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Europe's low-cost carriers 
planned to increase the number of seats by 11 per cent, and the continent's overall seat count by 7.7 per cent. 
Those numbers are actually decreases on previous plans: airline after airline announced it would grow more slowly, 
allowing it to protect its yields and pass on some of the higher fuel bills.
"If you look at the European market, there's too much supply," says Mark Manduca, an analyst at Citi. "We see the 
small guys looking for working capital, deferred revenue, prepayments, cash on the balance sheet."
Carsten Spohr, chief executive of Lufthansa, told the Financial Times in November that the airline industry needed 
to give up the "fantasy of growth going on forever" after a summer of strikes, delays and cancellations.
He says aviation capacity in Europe, measured by the number of seats, had increased about 6 per cent a year 
since 2016. This exceeds the industry's broad guide for sustainable growth of twice gross domestic product, which 
has recently been 2 per cent in Europe.
Problems with airspace, airports and delivery of aircraft show that "this industry has reached its maximum growth 
rate", says Mr Spohr. "What we need is healthy growth in line with infrastructure and manufacturers' capacity and 
airline capacity.
"We can't excuse ourselves, we are part of it."
Rising costs Cancelled flights over the summer required compensation, while jet fuel had nearly doubled in price 
Low-cost shakeout Primera, Cobalt, Azurair, Small Planet Airlines and SkyWork went out of business this year 
Offset headwinds The consolidation analysts recommend for European airlines would help reduce overcapacity 
'Zombie airlines' How to spot the signs of vulnerable carriers It is not easy to predict which airlines will fail, but there 
are characteristics industry observers look out for: weak balance sheets, high costs, ageing fleets. UBS analyst 
Jarrod Castle calls some of them "zombie airlines" which "seem to survive for a lot longer than anyone believes 
they will". Some benefit from state support, others have private owners who are prepared to invest in the hope of an 
upturn.
Wizz Air's Jozsef Váradi says "irrationalities" allow unlikely carriers to survive. "If you look at it from a central and 
eastern European perspective, you have a bunch of small national incumbents who haven't made money, who'll 
never make money, but are still going because the governments believe they need a national carrier for some 
reason."
Within Europe, the strongest players are legacy carriers such as IAG (owner of British Airways), the Lufthansa 
Group and Air France-KLM or the bigger lowcost carriers like Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz. Daniel Roeska at 
Bernstein argues that Europe's leading airlines are "far more resilient today than they previously were" and could 
capitalise on "disruptive opportunities" in a downturn.
Winter blues hit Europe's airlines European airlines have boomed over the past decade as low-cost carriers 
have opened up new routes. But facing higher fuel cos....
Consolidation has certainly been on the agenda for these airlines. IAG won Monarch's Gatwick slots in 2017 and 
took a small stake in Norwegian, a rival on its transatlantic routes, earlier this year as a prelude to a takeover, but 
had its offers rebuffed.
Lufthansa and easyJet took over different units and routes of Air Berlin, while both have been interested in 
acquiring Alitalia.
However, Mr Roeska says Americanstyle consolidation is "a topic for the next 10 years", and strict ownership rules 
meant global dealmaking would take the form of "partnerships, joint ventures and equity stakes", rather than 
mergers and acquisitions.
'When airlines go bust, they tend to go bust towards the end of the year because that is when cash balances are 
lowest'
'The industry has reached its maximum growth rate. We can't excuse ourselves, we are part of it'

It has been hard to concentrate on Christmas this year.
The first work bash I went to came just as Theresa May decided to cancel a big parliamentary vote on her Brexit 
plan. The second was held the same night her party's MPs voted on whether to ditch her as their leader.
The first time things began to feel Christmassy was at a Fleet Street women's party, where I heard a senior editor 
make an anguished confession about one of the great festive season traditions: the holiday leave roster.
For the first time in years, she was taking off every day from Christmas to New Year, leaving a team of underlings 
behind to slog through without her. She had never done this before. She felt dreadful. But trying to arrange holidays 
with half a family in another continent had left her with no other choice.
Journalists, like nurses and bus drivers, work through all types of holidays, which makes us unusually practised 
roster wranglers.
Yet as I listened to that editor talk, I had a disturbing thought. I have heard a lot of managers, inside and out of 
newspapers, fret about the duty they feel to share the pain of holiday working with their teams and every one of 
them has been a woman - including me in a former life. Maybe men feel the same guilty pangs about this stuff but 
don't bother carrying on about it. Or is this yet another tedious example of the need women feel to prove 
themselves in the office? Happily, I do not think it is. When I started asking around I soon uncovered a rich list of 
roster crimes committed by women and men alike.
Help wanted: a holiday roster that everyone can live with
The worst tale came from a man who once had a female boss in London who religiously booked up all the best 
holidays for herself, then stuffed the roster with minions to make sure she could relax uninterrupted.
One year, her team included a newly married and carless junior who was supposed to spend Christmas Day with 
his new bride's family hundreds of miles away.
She insisted he work on Christmas Eve, even though there were no trains the following day. He ended up spending 
Christmas Day alone in his flat in www.London.No one had been through anything like last year's mess at Ryanair, 
which suddenly announced it was cancelling hundreds of flights because of problems with its pilots' rosters.
Yet the stories I heard made me wonder why there is not more management research into holiday scheduling. It is 
hard to think of anything that exposes the divide between the conscientious and the cunning so deftly.
Everyone I spoke to had a painful memory of being duped by craftier colleagues. There were the people who kept a 
lookout for new rosters like ravening hawks and pounced ahead of everyone else to book the best times off.
There were the workers with families in distant countries who insisted on taking every Christmas off but refused to 
make up for it by working more in Easter or summer.
There were the bosses who swiped the best days for themselves or left it so late to finalise plans that their fuming 
teams had trouble booking holidays, an offence I think I committed myself when last left in charge of a roster. On 
and on it went, yet the misery was not relentless. A few people reported working for bosses who diligently started 
planning team leave months ahead. The best managers first asked for willing volunteers to try to sort out a more 
agreeable division of spoils.
Some used apps such as Google Docs that keep a pleasingly transparent record of who has worked when 
throughout the year. One person told of a company where bosses planned leave two Christmases ahead, so 
anyone missing out in one year could be assured of victory the next. I cannot see this working at an office where 
staff turnover is high, but I admire the general sentiment.
There are doubtless many superior ploys and I would be glad to hear of them. Meanwhile, anyone who has come 
up with a truly fail-safe way of dealing with roster ruin is wasted. They should go immediately to Westminster. If they 
can figure out how to solve a plight as perennially baffling as the roster, fixing the farce of Brexit should be a 
pushover.

It has been hard to concentrate on Christmas this year.
The first work bash I went to came just as Theresa May decided to cancel a big parliamentary vote on her Brexit 
plan. The second was held the same night her party's MPs voted on whether to ditch her as their leader.
The first time things began to feel Christmassy was at a Fleet Street women's party, where I heard a senior editor 
make an anguished confession about one of the great festive season traditions: the holiday leave roster.
For the first time in years, she was taking off every day from Christmas to New Year, leaving a team of underlings 
behind to slog through without her. She had never done this before. She felt dreadful. But trying to arrange holidays 
with half a family in another continent had left her with no other choice.
Journalists, like nurses and bus drivers, work through all types of holidays, which makes us unusually practised 
roster wranglers.
Yet as I listened to that editor talk, I had a disturbing thought. I have heard a lot of managers, inside and out of 
newspapers, fret about the duty they feel to share the pain of holiday working with their teams and every one of 
them has been a woman - including me in a former life. Maybe men feel the same guilty pangs about this stuff but 
don't bother carrying on about it. Or is this yet another tedious example of the need women feel to prove 
Help wanted: a holiday roster that everyone can live with Discover more insights at

themselves in the office? Happily, I do not think it is. When I started asking around I soon uncovered a rich list of 
roster crimes committed by women and men alike.
The worst tale came from a man who once had a female boss in London who religiously booked up all the best 
holidays for herself, then stuffed the roster with minions to make sure she could relax uninterrupted.
One year, her team included a newly married and carless junior who was supposed to spend Christmas Day with 
his new bride's family hundreds of miles away.
She insisted he work on Christmas Eve, even though there were no trains the following day. He ended up spending 
Christmas Day alone in his flat in www.London.No one had been through anything like last year's mess at Ryanair, 
which suddenly announced it was cancelling hundreds of flights because of problems with its pilots' rosters.
Yet the stories I heard made me wonder why there is not more management research into holiday scheduling. It is 
hard to think of anything that exposes the divide between the conscientious and the cunning so deftly.
Everyone I spoke to had a painful memory of being duped by craftier colleagues. There were the people who kept a 
lookout for new rosters like ravening hawks and pounced ahead of everyone else to book the best times off.
There were the workers with families in distant countries who insisted on taking every Christmas off but refused to 
make up for it by working more in Easter or summer.
There were the bosses who swiped the best days for themselves or left it so late to finalise plans that their fuming 
teams had trouble booking holidays, an offence I think I committed myself when last left in charge of a roster. On 
and on it went, yet the misery was not relentless. A few people reported working for bosses who diligently started 
planning team leave months ahead. The best managers first asked for willing volunteers to try to sort out a more 
agreeable division of spoils.
Some used apps such as Google Docs that keep a pleasingly transparent record of who has worked when 
throughout the year. One person told of a company where bosses planned leave two Christmases ahead, so 
anyone missing out in one year could be assured of victory the next. I cannot see this working at an office where 
staff turnover is high, but I admire the general sentiment.
There are doubtless many superior ploys and I would be glad to hear of them. Meanwhile, anyone who has come 
up with a truly fail-safe way of dealing with roster ruin is wasted. They should go immediately to Westminster. If they 
can figure out how to solve a plight as perennially baffling as the roster, fixing the farce of Brexit should be a

t's one of the greatest ironies of Brexit - I've never needed a holiday more, yet I'm too scared to book one.
IParliament has descended into full-on panto mode, and the odds of a chaotic "no-deal Brexit" are rising by the day. 
My desire to escape this madness and head to a remote foreign beach with no mobile signal where I can bury my 
head in the sand is increasing at roughly the same rate. But there's a dilemma.
January is traditionally the time of year when thoughts turn to booking a holiday. But if your planned break is after 
March 29 next year - not forgetting that Easter Sunday falls very late on April 21 - then could a botched Brexit 
scupper any chances of relaxation? Politicians can try all they might to reassure us that foreign travel will carry on 
as normal in the event of "no deal" but, in reality, they have no idea. Wherever you go, if it involves an airport I think 
we can safely predict travel chaos.
Forgive me for doubting the resilience of UK airports but, as we saw this week, sightings of rogue drones were 
enough to close Gatwick airport for a whole day.
I was caught up in a Ryanair strikerelated incident last summer. Our flight home was cancelled at short notice, and I 
spent a lot of time and money rebooking flights and finding last-minute hotel rooms. When things go wrong at 
airports, it is horribly stressful - doubly so if you are travelling with children - and there is never anyone around to 
help. I have since managed to reclaim nearly all of the money back, but I do not wish to repeat the experience.
Leave or remain? The dilemma of booking next year's holidays Claer Barrett Serious Money Financial 
Commentator of the Year
Simon Calder - less a travel journalist and more of a national institution - has written this week that he fears there 
will be mass cancellations of European flights in the event of a no-deal Brexit because new legislation dictates that 
the number of departures would be capped at 2018 levels.
The authorities say this is worrying over nothing, and that we should "book with confidence". If flights are cancelled, 
they say, the cost should be automatically refunded. But as I found this summer, prices shoot up in the resultant 
scramble to re-book.
Mr Calder also notes that many travel providers are adding "Brexit clauses" to their terms and conditions, specifying 
they will not be liable for consequential losses in the event of cancellations. So if you had booked your flight, 
accommodation and car hire separately - which many of us do in this digital age - even if you can't get there to 
enjoy it you will still have to pay for it all, and you won't be able to claim compensation.
So now is not the time to stint on travel insurance. Unfortunately, the loss of the European Health Insurance Card is 
likely to push up premiums substantially for those of us with pre-existing medical conditions.
My parents - whom I lovingly refer to as the Saganauts - have decided to book their next holiday with a package 
tour operator. That way, if anything goes wrong the travel company will have to put it right. As they are both retired, 
they can also be more flexible with travel dates if their holiday needs to be rearranged.
If you're a wage slave like me, the chances are your options are more limited. I am aiming for the "Easter streak" 
where a nine-day holiday will generate 18 days away from the office (book from Good Friday on April 19 and return 
after the bank holiday on May 6).
I can think of a dozen places in Italy that we'd love to tick off, but assuming we survive queueing for days to leave 
no-deal Brexit Britain, our reward could be crippling currency exchange rates if sterling sinks further.
All of this builds the case for British staycations - certainly for the first half of the year until things calm down. Now 
that our son has settled in the south-west, we have long weekend breaks planned for Exmouth and Dartmouth, 
making use of our "Two Together" railcard and cheap advance fares. Renting a whole house on Airbnb means we 
can take the rest of our brood and their significant others.
I have also pencilled in a few days in Rye, on the Sussex coast, as I intend to spend a fortune in Glass Etc, the 
shop owned by Andy McConnell, my favourite expert from the BBC's Antiques Roadshow. And we've decided this 
could be the year to do the Outer Hebrides (but after Easter, when the weather has warmed up a bit). Nevertheless, 
my choices have been mocked by office colleagues who reckon going on holiday in the UK is a rip off. I have to 
agree with them, it is expensive. And we are unlikely to have a repeat of this year's long hot summer.
Ahead of the Christmas holidays, I have one final money-saving holiday thought. Scour your address book for 
friends and relatives you haven't seen for ages who live in interesting parts of the UK. Send them a Christmas card 
(quick!) promising to come and stay in 2019 - but just make sure they share your views on Brexit.

London (dpa) - London's Gatwick Airport - Britain's second-busiest - reopened Friday after a 36-hour shutdown 
caused by drone sightings.
The disruption since Wednesday affected tens of thousands of passengers and caused hundreds of flights to be 
cancelled.
Military equipment has also been deployed as part of attempts to prevent further disruption.
Transport Minister Chris Grayling told the BBC that the protective measures included "military capabilities," but did 
not offer details.
He said there had been around 40 drone sightings while the airport was closed.
Military experts have joined police units, including snipers and a helicopter. Police officers were also sighted on the 
roof of a building at the airport on Friday.
Authorities were also searching for the drone operators after the multiple drone sightings began late on 
Wednesday.
Flying a drone within 1 kilometre of an airport or airfield boundary was made illegal in Britain in July, but aviation 
officials and lawmakers have called for a 5-kilometre exclusion zone.
Although flights have resumed, the airport cautioned on its Twitter account that there were "knock-on delays and 
cancellations to flights."
The airport said 765 flights were scheduled for departure and arrival on Friday, while about 140 have been 
cancelled.
Gatwick reopens after drone sightings, but delays expected
"We are now operating at almost normal runway conditions and the challenge for the airlines, as the result of this 
disruption, [is that] their planes are not all in the right place," Gatwick's chief operating officer Chris Woodroofe said, 
according to the BBC.
Passengers were advised to check the status of their flight before heading off for the airport.
Low-cost airline Ryanair for instance said its planes would use London's third largest airport, Stansted. Passengers 
have been informed, Ryanair said.
EasyJet, another no-frills carrier, meanwhile advised passengers to check its designated flight checker app rather 
than tweet for flight information "due to the unprecedented volume of tweets we're receiving at the moment."

UK regulator seeks to halt Alstom tie-up with Siemens Competition fears
UK regulator seeks to halt Alstom tie-up with Siemens; Competition fears

The UK competition watchdog has joined with other European regulators to try to stop the Siemens-Alstom merger 
unless the companies make bigger concessions.
The Competition and Markets Authority and regulators from Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium have written to 
Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, expressing concerns that "the overall loss of competition 
brought about by the merger would be both widespread and very significant".
The remedies proposed by the businesses "fall far short of what would be required to address all concerns to the 
required standard", the signatories add.
Germany's Siemens and France's Alstom presented their plans for a merger in September last year, saying they 
wanted to create a European rail champion capable of competing with China's state-backed operator, CRRC. The 
French and German governments support the deal. Ms Vestager has been willing to stand up to political pressure. 
Last year she insisted on substantial remedies in Lufthansa's purchase of Air Berlin's Niki airline despite strong 
backing from Berlin. Ryanair bought most of Niki and its Vienna hub airport has since become a low-cost 
battleground.
This week ministers from 18 EU states backed support of reforms to competition law "to better take into account 
international markets and competition in merger analysis" and fend off the challenge from "other major economic 
blocs, which are developing ... proactive industrial strategies".
UK regulator seeks to halt Alstom tie-up with Siemens Competition fears
However, the letter from the antitrust bodies illustrates the growing battle in Europe over the merger. It is almost 
unprecedented for national regulators to lobby Brussels over a big merger, while the CMA has only done so once 
before, over the proposed O2/Three tie-up, which was blocked by Ms Vestager.
The regulators' concerns focused on very high-speed rolling stock - the type of train used on the Eurostar and 
Thalys networks, and which could be used on the UK's High Speed 2 project. Signalling systems, which include on-
board technology, trackside equipment and routing software, are also a big issue.
Siemens and Alstom have offered to sell off some of their older high-speed train and signalling technology to push 
through the merger. That proposal has left rivals, some national regulators and other interested parties 
unimpressed.
As Siemens and Alstom are so dominant, the CMA and others say proposals offered to address competition 
concerns "require a very substantial remedy, typically the full divestment of one or other of the merging parties' 
overlapping businesses to a suitable buyer".
But the proposed divestments of highspeed technology, either a fixed-term European licence for Siemens' Velaro 
3G system, or a portion of Alstom's Pendolino business in Europe, would still leave the combined business "facing 
insufficient competition in ongoing and future tenders", the regulators added.
Andrew Haines, Network Rail chief executive, called the proposal "anticompetitive" and Tom Cole, at the Office of 
Rail and Road, said it believed the deal should be blocked. FT Big Read page 13

maintenance was carried out in 1994. As part of the strategic plan for continued investment to cater for the growth 
of the airport, within our existing S106 planning agreement, we are enhancing the durability and performance of the 
runway.”To avoid any disruption to flights operations, the airport will carry out the majority of the works during night 
hours.The runway will be shutdown between the hours 23.30-06.30 to all aircraft so that the contractors can 
complete the planned work in a safe environment.The runway maintenance work is likely to complete in almost 
three months.

Gatwick works on 'contingency plans' as drone sightings continue
Gatwick works on 'contingency plans' as drone sightings continue

London's Gatwick Airport is working on "contingency plans" for Friday, after the drone sightings that have caused 
hundreds of flights to be cancelled continued for a second night late Thursday.
Britain's second-busiest airport would remain closed for the rest of Thursday, chief operating officer Chris 
Woodroofe said, adding that it was considering cancelling all flights the following day.
"I think what's clear from the last 24 hours is that drones are a UKaviation issue, or even an international aviation 
issue," Woodroofe told reporters.
"We have had the police, we have had the military seeking to bring this drone down for the last 24 hours and to 
date that has not been successful."
"So Gatwick Airport is still closed, it's closed for the rest of this evening and our intention is to review on an ongoing 
basis whether we can open tomorrow.
"But we are working up contingency plans all the way through to no flights tomorrow."
He said he felt "terribly sorry" for the 120,000 passengers whose flights had been disrupted by "this criminal 
activity."
Ryanair said it was rerouting its Friday flights from Gatwick out of Stansted Airport.
Military experts joined police units, including snipers and a helicopter on Thursday in the search for the operators of 
drones but with no success.
Gatwick works on 'contingency plans' as drone sightings continue
Prime Minister Theresa May earlier told reporters that the government would work with airport authorities to "bring 
this to a close such that people will be able to get on to the travel that they were expecting over the Christmas."
"The activity we have seen is illegal and those who are caught endangering aircraft can face up to five years in 
prison," she added.
Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson declined to say how the military would help, while his ministry tweeted only 
that it would provide "specialist equipment" to help the police.
Flights were suspended after reports of multiple sightings of drones flying over the airport in the southern English 
county of Sussex from 9 pm on Wednesday.
Sussex Police said officers believed "the Gatwick devices used are of an industrial specification."
British media published photographs of a police helicopter flying over the runway and armed officers carrying rifles 
near the airport.
The police said there was no indication of terrorism.
Superintendent Justin Burtenshaw, head of armed policing for Sussex, told the BBC it was "challenging" to find the 
drone operators.
"Each time we believe we get close to the operator, the drone disappears; when we look to reopen the airfield, the 
drone reappears," Burtenshaw said.
Flying a drone within 1 kilometre of an airport or airfield boundary was made illegal in Britain in July, but aviation 
officials and lawmakers have called for a 5-kilometre exclusion zone.
The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) said the first 11 months of 2018 saw 117 "near misses," compared to 
93 for the whole of 2017.
"The public needs to understand that drones are not just toys and could have catastrophic consequences if they 
collide with an aircraft," BALPA's head of flight safety, Rob Hunter, said in a statement on the Gatwick disruption.

Budget airline Ryanair has rerouted flights scheduled Friday to go through another airport in London after repeated 
sightings of drones brought Gatwick Airport to a standstill.
The Ryanair flights would instead be operating out of Stansted Airport, Ryanair said online, citing "ongoing issues" 
at Gatwick.
Broadcaster Sky News reported that people were being advised to not come to Gatwick for the time being, including 
on Friday.

A round-up of 2018's start-up carriers and those airlines that suspended, ceased operations or entered formal 
restructuring during the year
This year began with a number of new players optimistic of making their mark in the airline sector. But, against a 
backdrop of rising fuel costs, the second half of 2018 was to prove challenging. And by the time oil prices eased, 
the damage for many was done and a number of carriers had been forced to halt flights.
While there was no repeat of the big-name casualties of 2017, and most of the failed operators were small or new 
players – including several that launched and collapsed or scaled back their scheduled ambitions within the year – 
there were still several high-profile groundings.
EUROPE
In Europe, there were several insolvencies as higher fuel prices took a toll in the tougher winter months.
The year began with airlines jockeying for the space vacated by Air Berlin and its Austrian unit Niki, in some cases 
using the assets of those carriers.
At the start of the year, EasyJet started operating at Berlin Tegel, where it was joined in the summer season by 
Laudamotion – established from the assets of Niki by that carrier's founder, Niki Lauda. Ryanair later acquired a 
75% stake in the unit
Despite boosting its presence in leisure markets from Austria and Germany, Laudamotion is forecast by Ryanair to 
lose money this year and not reach breakeven until its third year of operations.
ANALYSIS: Airline start-ups and failures 2018 A round-up of 2018's start-up carriers and those airlines that 
suspended, ceased operations or entered formal rest....
IAG, which had also been in the running to acquire Niki, in July established a new Austrian-based low-cost carrier 
under its Level brand. IAG also moved Level into Paris Orly, taking over the air operator's certificate of long-haul 
premium unit OpenSkies. The last flights under that brand took place in September.
While not a new name or carrier, Meridiana relaunched in February under the old Air Italy name. The revamp 
follows Qatar Airways' 49% investment in the airline.
Air Nostrum's owners outlined plans to create a new carrier in Ireland called Hibernian Airlines, which will specialise 
in European wet-lease operations. The Spanish carrier, which in July announced a tie-up with CityJet, has been 
aiming to have the new airline operational by year-end.
Ukrainian budget carrier SkyUp began operations in May, with services to resorts in Egypt. Having launched with a 
pair of 737-800s, SkyUp has also reached a deal with Boeing to take up to 10 737 Max jets.
Romanian operator Just Us Air added an A321 shortly after launching in April with an A319.
Air Albania's creation was cleared by the national competition authority at the end of September. The regulator was 
notified of plans for Air Albania by Albcontrol, a state company that manages national airspace and will own 10% of 
the carrier. Turkish Airlines is to hold 49% and MDN Investment 41%.
Georgian carrier Myway Airlines and Air Belgium each launched during 2018, though both have scaled back their 
scheduled operations over the winter. Myway suspended all but one of its scheduled services as the Georgian 
carrier dealt with a number of number of issues, including renewed tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
Air Belgium launched flights in June, initially operating Airbus A340 services from Brussels Charleroi to Hong Kong. 
It pulled this service at the end October, however, citing a contractual dispute with a commercial partner, and is 
focusing for now on wet-lease services. It recently reportedly secured fresh financing from Belgium-based 
investment fund Sogepa.
Another Belgian operator, the relaunched VLM, had been revived by SHS Aviation in 2017. But its re-emergence 
proved short-lived as it was placed into liquidation in September.
Russian carrier Saratov Airlines was grounded at the end of May, just months before a newly developed airport for 
its home city was due to open. That came less than four months after a fatal accident involving one of Saratov's 
Antonov An-148s. One of its shareholders, Russian entrepreneur Arkady Evstafiev, began work on a successor 
carrier – although the project has yet to formally emerge.
Come the winter, Cobalt, Primera, PrivatAir and Small Planet Airlines were all among carriers forced to halt flights.
Lithuania's civil aviation authority suspended the operating licence of restructuring leisure carrier Small Planet 
Airlines in late November. The carrier had begun a formal restructuring, which it said had become necessary to 
protect it from the "negative impact" of the financial fallout from its Polish and German sister companies. Both of 
these units had earlier filed for restructuring
Cypriot carrier Cobalt Air suspended operations in October, having emerged just two years ago as one of several 
start-ups in the wake of flag carrier Cyprus Airways' collapse in 2015.
Swiss premium charter specialist PrivatAir filed for insolvency, along with its German subsidiary, in November. 
PrivatAir stated that a number of events had had a "significant impact" on the companies' future business forecast 
and viability.
PrivatAir, which was established more than 40 years ago, specialised in all-business transport using aircraft such as 
Boeing 737s and A319s configured with premium cabin layouts. It also operated long-haul types such as the 767 
and was a customer for the 787.
ANALYSIS: Airline start-ups and failures 2018 A round-up of 2018's start-up carriers and those airlines that 
suspended, ceased operations or entered formal rest....
The highest-profile of the European airline failures during 2018 was Primera. The leisure carrier had taken its first 
steps in the long-haul, low-cost segment – and had just rolled out ambitious plans to spread its presence to points 
across mainland Europe – when it was forced to halt flights after planned investment failed to materialise. That it 
should collapse a year to the day after Monarch Airlines merely underscored the challenges that European winters 
can hold for struggling operators.
NORTH AMERICA
JetBlue and Azul founder David Neeleman cemented his plans for a new US start-up by striking a tentative deal at 
July's Farnborough air show for 60 A220-300s.
With his launching of JetBlue in 2002, Neeleman had been responsible for one of the last major new US entrants, 
and his plans for a new carrier dominated headlines when they first emerged in June.
While initial reports suggested that the airline would be called Moxy, Neeleman said this was just a working name. 
The carrier is aiming to launch in 2021.
Elsewhere in the USA, Great Lakes Airlines – a turboprop operator with a network that connected cities in western 
USA – suspended all scheduled flights on 26 March. The company has long said that a 2013 pilot hiring rule 
created a shortage of flightcrew that particularly impacted small regional airlines.
A new regional operator launched in November when California Pacific Airlines began services from the McClellan-
Palomar airport near Carlsbad, California, operating to San Jose and Reno using a 50-seat Embraer ERJ-145.
Across the border in Canada, WestJet's ultra-discount unit Swoop began operations in June and quickly expanded 
into cross-border flights. Swoop added US flights in October and plans to start services to Mexico and the 
Caribbean in early 2019.
A number of new players have emerged in the Canadian low-cost market. Flair Airlines launched last summer, and 
Jetlines is aiming to launch next year. In September, Jetlines promoted Javier Suarez to chief executive, its third 
leadership change in the past two years. "The market will be super-stimulated as soon as low fares get into the 
market," says Suarez. "Things are going well for us to get the [AOC] by May 2019."

High-profile Vietnam start-up carrier Bamboo Airways spent much of the year eyeing the launch of operations.
The carrier had initially planned to start services in October, before setting its sights on 29 December start amid 
delays securing the necessary licensing. But whilst in November securing approval for its air transport business 
licence, the airline has now pushed its launch into January.
Flight Fleets Analyzer shows Bamboo has leases in place for five A320 family jet and has said it aims to have a 
fleet of 20 in the first quarter of 2019. The ambitious start-up also signed letters of intent to take 20 787-9s and 24 
A321neos.
Air Astana aims to launch its new low-cost unit FlyArystan in the first half of 2019, operating from multiple bases in 
Kazakhstan with a view to reaching a fleet of at least 15 aircraft by 2022.
Planned start-up Starlux Airlines in May received a permit from Taiwanese regulators for its establishment. It was 
aiming to complete the licensing work by the end of this year with a view to launching in early 2020. The airline is 
leasing 10 A321neos from the end of 2019. Starlux also committed to taking 17 A350s, including the -1000 variant, 
giving it a fleet of 27 aircraft in 2024.

Chinese start-up carrier Genghis Khan Airlines placed an order for 25 Comac ARJ21-700 aircraft in August. 
Genghis Khan was rebranded from Tianjiao Airlines, which had been granted preliminary approval in February by 
the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
Cambodian start-up KC International Airlines received its first aircraft at the end of June, an A320. The carrier was 
established in Phnom Penh with $100 million in launch capital as a joint venture between Cambodian and Chinese 
investors. It secured its AOC in August.
Maldivian start-up Manta Air is taking a pair of new ATR 72-600s from European regional aircraft lessor Nordic 
Aviation Capital. Based at Velana International airport in Male, the aircraft will be used to serve Kudahuvadhoo, 
Dharavandhoo and Thimarafushi, respectively located in the Dhaalu, Baa and Thaa atolls. Another carrier in the 
region, Mega Maldives Airlines, had suspended operations in summer 2017.
Indian carrier Star Air had been aiming to start operations in September but is still to launch. The airline has been 
due to operate a pair of ERJ-145s on domestic routes operating under India's regional connectivity scheme from its 
base at Bengaluru's Kempegowda International airport.
South Korean start-up Air Pohang began services on 7 February using two Bombardier CRJ200s, but it suspended 
operations at the start of December, with a view to restarting services in early 2019 with A319s.
Similarly, the resumption of services by Air Mandalay proved short-lived. The airline resumed services early in 2018 
after several months on the ground. But the operator was forced to suspend operations again in early September 
amid reports of a further restructuring.
Regional carrier JetGo Australia suspended its scheduled services after entering voluntary administration on 1 
June.
Elsewhere, Indonesia AirAsia X will cease scheduled operations in January 2019 and operate as a non-scheduled 
commercial airline thereafter. The carrier's only scheduled operation – a seven-times-weekly service between 
Denpasar and Tokyo Narita using an A330 – will be suspended in January,
LATIN AMERICA
Avianca Brazil became the biggest carrier of the year to run into formal troubles, when it filed for the Brazilian 
equivalent of bankruptcy in December. The carrier, which is owned by Synergy Group but is a separate company in 
all but name from Colombia's Avianca, sought court protection following an unsuccessful effort to renegotiate 
aircraft leases with lessors.
Aircastle was among lessors that moved to repossess at least 13 aircraft on 10 December – representing around 
one-quarter of its fleet. The carrier is continuing to operate flights.
Conditions have become more challenging in the region, notably amid weak local currencies against the strong US 
dollar.
Argentina, which has seen a string of start-ups of late amid the liberalisation of the country's aviation market, is 
another market that has been affected.
Regional airline LASA, which only began operations at the start of November, within a month "suspended 
temporarily" all flights as it tries to find investment. The Neuquen-based ERJ-145 operator cited currency issues, 
rising fuel costs, the recent abolition of the minimum air fares and low load factors for forcing the move.
Ironically, minimum air fares ruled were removed in part to help fuel low-fare travel in the country. The likes of 
Flybondi, which launched flights in January, Norwegian's new Argentinian unit that followed in October, had been 
pressing for the rule change.

Flybondi, which operates 737s out of Buenos Aires' new El Palomar low-cost airport, in December launched its first 
international services flying to Asuncion in Paraguay and Punta del Este in Uruguay.
Argentinian regional carrier Flyest also began scheduled flights in October, while Jetsmart is planning to start 
domestic Argentinian flights in 2019 after reportedly acquiring Cordoba-based start-up airline Alas del Sur Lineas 
Aereas during the summer.
Grounded Venezuelan carrier Aserca Airlines at the end of May acknowledged that it was unable to resume 
operations and requested that Venezuela's civil aviation authority INAC cancel its AOC. Aserca is the third and last 
of the airlines owned by Venezuelan businessman Simeon Garcia that have gone out of business in months. His 
Dominican Republic-based PAWA and Caracas-based Santa Barbara Airlines had gone into liquidation earlier this 
year.
But another Venezuelan carrier Aeropostal resumed commercial flights with flights to Havana in August, after it was 
grounded for almost a year. Aeropostal resumed service with a single Boeing MD-82 from its fleet of eight, which 
had been grounded as a result of the economic crisis in the country.
AFRICA
Nigerian government efforts to establish a new flag carrier for the African state airline foundered just weeks after a 
high-profile launch.
Transport minister Hadi Sirika had unveiled details of the airline, Nigeria Air, during an event at the Farnborough air 
show in July. But in September, Sirika disclosed, via his social media feed, that the Nigerian cabinet, the federal 
executive council, has "taken the tough decision to suspend the national carrier project".
He did not specify reasons for the suspension and later hinted that the project was still in play, and was quoted as 
saying that it would be activated as soon as possible. But as the year closed, there was no firm date for its launch.
But another Nigerian start-up burst onto the scene at the end of the year, when Green Africa struck a tentative deal 
for up to 100 Boeing 737 Max 8 jets. Based in Lagos, Green Africa recently received its air transport license and is 
in the process of obtaining an air operator's certificate. It plans to operate within Nigeria, and has intentions to build 
a pan-Africa network.
SA Express has slowly been resuming services since South African regulators in July reinstated its AOC. The 
carrier was temporarily grounded in May when its operating licences and the certificates of airworthiness for nine of 
its 21 aircraft were suspended following a safety audit.
Former chief Siza Mzimela has returned to manage the airline on an acting basis. While services have resumed, SA 
Express faces financial concerns and has required a further bail-out from the South African government
Air Senegal began its first flights in May, launching with a domestic service between Dakar and Ziguinchor. The 
carrier, which added international flights in October, operates ATR 72-600s and A319s, and has a pair of A330neos 
on order.
Chad's new Ethiopian Airlines-backed flag carrier began domestic operations in October. Ethiopian has a 49% 
stake in the joint venture, named Tchadia Airlines. The balance is held by Chad's government.
It is one of several African joint-venture carriers in which Ethiopian has invested. Zambia Airways, in which 
Ethiopian holds a 45% share, is planning to begin flights early next year, while the carrier has sealed an agreement 
with the Ghanaian government to develop a new national carrier for the country.

Kuwaiti carrier Wataniya Airways suspended operations in September, days after receiving a grounding threat from 
the country’s regulator. The airline had been struggling to deal with cancellations and flight disruption.
Wataniya emerged with the same name, but a different operating model, to a predecessor airline which collapsed in 
2011. The carrier had appeared to be embarking on a fleet-renewal programme, after Golden Falcon Aviation 
unveiled an agreement to take 25 Airbus A320neos for Wataniya during the Farnborough air show.
Royal Jordanian ended services of its charter operation Royal Wings at the end of November, citing losses incurred 
by the unit, although talks are being held with potential buyers of the airline.
Plans are under way for a new Aqaba-based airline to launch next spring, as part of continued efforts to develop 
tourism in the Jordanian city.

A round-up of 2018's start-up carriers and those airlines that suspended, ceased operations or entered formal 
restructuring during the year
This year began with a number of new players optimistic of making their mark in the airline sector. But, against a 
backdrop of rising fuel costs, the second half of 2018 was to prove challenging. And by the time oil prices eased, 
the damage for many was done and a number of carriers had been forced to halt flights.
While there was no repeat of the big-name casualties of 2017, and most of the failed operators were small or new 
players – including several that launched and collapsed or scaled back their scheduled ambitions within the year – 
there were still several high-profile groundings.
EUROPE
In Europe, there were several insolvencies as higher fuel prices took a toll in the tougher winter months.
The year began with airlines jockeying for the space vacated by Air Berlin and its Austrian unit Niki, in some cases 
using the assets of those carriers.
At the start of the year, EasyJet started operating at Berlin Tegel, where it was joined in the summer season by 
Laudamotion – established from the assets of Niki by that carrier's founder, Niki Lauda. Ryanair later acquired a 
75% stake in the unit
Despite boosting its presence in leisure markets from Austria and Germany, Laudamotion is forecast by Ryanair to 
lose money this year and not reach breakeven until its third year of operations.
ANALYSIS: Airline start-ups and failures 2018 A round-up of 2018's start-up carriers and those airlines that 
suspended, ceased operations or entered formal rest....
IAG, which had also been in the running to acquire Niki, in July established a new Austrian-based low-cost carrier 
under its Level brand. IAG also moved Level into Paris Orly, taking over the air operator's certificate of long-haul 
premium unit OpenSkies. The last flights under that brand took place in September.
While not a new name or carrier, Meridiana relaunched in February under the old Air Italy name. The revamp 
follows Qatar Airways' 49% investment in the airline.
Air Nostrum's owners outlined plans to create a new carrier in Ireland called Hibernian Airlines, which will specialise 
in European wet-lease operations. The Spanish carrier, which in July announced a tie-up with CityJet, has been 
aiming to have the new airline operational by year-end.
Ukrainian budget carrier SkyUp began operations in May, with services to resorts in Egypt. Having launched with a 
pair of 737-800s, SkyUp has also reached a deal with Boeing to take up to 10 737 Max jets.
Romanian operator Just Us Air added an A321 shortly after launching in April with an A319.
Air Albania's creation was cleared by the national competition authority at the end of September. The regulator was 
notified of plans for Air Albania by Albcontrol, a state company that manages national airspace and will own 10% of 
the carrier. Turkish Airlines is to hold 49% and MDN Investment 41%.
Georgian carrier Myway Airlines and Air Belgium each launched during 2018, though both have scaled back their 
scheduled operations over the winter. Myway suspended all but one of its scheduled services as the Georgian 
carrier dealt with a number of number of issues, including renewed tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
Air Belgium launched flights in June, initially operating Airbus A340 services from Brussels Charleroi to Hong Kong. 
It pulled this service at the end October, however, citing a contractual dispute with a commercial partner, and is 
focusing for now on wet-lease services. It recently reportedly secured fresh financing from Belgium-based 
investment fund Sogepa.
Another Belgian operator, the relaunched VLM, had been revived by SHS Aviation in 2017. But its re-emergence 
proved short-lived as it was placed into liquidation in September.
Russian carrier Saratov Airlines was grounded at the end of May, just months before a newly developed airport for 
its home city was due to open. That came less than four months after a fatal accident involving one of Saratov's 
Antonov An-148s. One of its shareholders, Russian entrepreneur Arkady Evstafiev, began work on a successor 
carrier – although the project has yet to formally emerge.
Come the winter, Cobalt, Primera, PrivatAir and Small Planet Airlines were all among carriers forced to halt flights.
Lithuania's civil aviation authority suspended the operating licence of restructuring leisure carrier Small Planet 
Airlines in late November. The carrier had begun a formal restructuring, which it said had become necessary to 
protect it from the "negative impact" of the financial fallout from its Polish and German sister companies. Both of 
these units had earlier filed for restructuring
Cypriot carrier Cobalt Air suspended operations in October, having emerged just two years ago as one of several 
start-ups in the wake of flag carrier Cyprus Airways' collapse in 2015.
Swiss premium charter specialist PrivatAir filed for insolvency, along with its German subsidiary, in November. 
PrivatAir stated that a number of events had had a "significant impact" on the companies' future business forecast 
and viability.
PrivatAir, which was established more than 40 years ago, specialised in all-business transport using aircraft such as 
Boeing 737s and A319s configured with premium cabin layouts. It also operated long-haul types such as the 767 
and was a customer for the 787.

The highest-profile of the European airline failures during 2018 was Primera. The leisure carrier had taken its first 
steps in the long-haul, low-cost segment – and had just rolled out ambitious plans to spread its presence to points 
across mainland Europe – when it was forced to halt flights after planned investment failed to materialise. That it 
should collapse a year to the day after Monarch Airlines merely underscored the challenges that European winters 
can hold for struggling operators.
NORTH AMERICA
JetBlue and Azul founder David Neeleman cemented his plans for a new US start-up by striking a tentative deal at 
July's Farnborough air show for 60 A220-300s.
With his launching of JetBlue in 2002, Neeleman had been responsible for one of the last major new US entrants, 
and his plans for a new carrier dominated headlines when they first emerged in June.
While initial reports suggested that the airline would be called Moxy, Neeleman said this was just a working name. 
The carrier is aiming to launch in 2021.
Elsewhere in the USA, Great Lakes Airlines – a turboprop operator with a network that connected cities in western 
USA – suspended all scheduled flights on 26 March. The company has long said that a 2013 pilot hiring rule 
created a shortage of flightcrew that particularly impacted small regional airlines.
A new regional operator launched in November when California Pacific Airlines began services from the McClellan-
Palomar airport near Carlsbad, California, operating to San Jose and Reno using a 50-seat Embraer ERJ-145.
Across the border in Canada, WestJet's ultra-discount unit Swoop began operations in June and quickly expanded 
into cross-border flights. Swoop added US flights in October and plans to start services to Mexico and the 
Caribbean in early 2019.
A number of new players have emerged in the Canadian low-cost market. Flair Airlines launched last summer, and 
Jetlines is aiming to launch next year. In September, Jetlines promoted Javier Suarez to chief executive, its third 
leadership change in the past two years. "The market will be super-stimulated as soon as low fares get into the 
market," says Suarez. "Things are going well for us to get the [AOC] by May 2019."

High-profile Vietnam start-up carrier Bamboo Airways spent much of the year eyeing the launch of operations.
The carrier had planned to start services on 10 October, but this date passed without a launch, apparently owing to 
hold-ups with its AOC. It is now targeting a 29 December start, parent FLC Group said in a statement related to an 
agreement between it and state-owned companies under the Petrolimex banner.
The statement adds that Bamboo will start operations with 10 aircraft, growing to 20 in the first quarter of 2019. 
Bamboo Airways received its air transport business licence in early November, but still needs an AOC before 
launching services. The ambitious start-up also signed letters of intent to take 20 787-9s and 24 A321neos.
Air Astana aims to launch its new low-cost unit FlyArystan in the first half of 2019, operating from multiple bases in 
Kazakhstan with a view to reaching a fleet of at least 15 aircraft by 2022.

leasing 10 A321neos from the end of 2019. Starlux also committed to taking 17 A350s, including the -1000 variant,

No-deal Brexit: 'Managed glidepath' or total chaos?
No-deal Brexit: 'Managed glidepath' or total chaos?

Extreme doomsday scenarios for a no-deal Brexit - often based on loosely-defined scenarios - forecast grounded 
passenger planes, enormous queues at customs points and businesses crippled by bureaucratic chaos.
But pro-Brexit lawmakers from Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative party, many of whom prefer no deal to 
her deal, insist that there is little to worry about.
The truth probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes.
If British lawmakers do not accept May's withdrawal deal and fail to ratify it before March 29, Britain would be on 
track for an unregulated Brexit.
EU rules would cease to apply in Britain, which would drop out of shared arrangements such as common air traffic 
rules or trade deals with third countries.
The land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland poses a particular problem. Efforts to keep 
that border open have been at the heart of Brexit negotiations.
British citizens living in the EU and EU citizens in Britain could also face uncertainty over their status.
But according to British eurosceptics, such predictions are part of a "project fear" to persuade people to accept 
May's deal.
They say the two sides would be able to agree a series of rapid, sectoral mini-deals to minimize disruption before 
they negotiate an alternative, perhaps Canada-style deal after Brexit.
No-deal Brexit: 'Managed glidepath' or total chaos?
In their favour, two of the largest budget airlines operating in Britain - Ryanair and easyJet - have both said in recent 
weeks that they anticipate relatively little disruption from a no-deal Brexit.
Penny Mordaunt, a prominent pro-Brexit minister in May's cabinet, coined an addition to the growing Brexit lexicon 
late Monday: "managed glidepath."
"The chief concern businesses have in my constituency about no deal would be the absence of a smooth and 
managed glidepath to future trading relationships," The Sun newspaper quoted Mordaunt as saying in a speech at 
a private members' club in London.
"It's in our interest, and the interest of every member state of the EU, that we have a smooth transition and that is 
what we should be focusing on in the immediate future," Mordaunt said.
The Brexiteers argue that any short-term damage would be more than offset by the long-term trade deals Britain 
plans to sign with major non-EU economies such as the United States, China and India.
"Leaving without a deal is not the end of the world," Jacob Rees-Mogg, who heads a group of dozens of 
eurosceptic Conservative lawmakers, tweeted on Tuesday, as May's cabinet announced plans to make planning for 
a no-deal Brexit an "operational priority" for the government.
Defence Secretary Gacin Williamson said 3,500 troops will be placed on standby in case they are needed by the 
government.
May admitted to parliament on Monday that a no-deal Brexit would bring risks to "the jobs, services and security of 
the people we serve by turning our backs on an agreement [with the EU]."
She said the government had already stepped up preparations for potential post-Brexit problems "such as the flow 
of traffic into different ports here in the UK."
But May stopped short of the forecasts of doom issued last month by her government and the central bank.
Under her withdrawal agreement, Britain's economy would be 3.9 per cent smaller in 15 years' time than it would be 
if the country remained in the EU, according to a government forecast.
A no-deal Brexit would see GDP fall even further, by 9.3 per cent from GDP over the same period, it said.
The Bank of England warned the same day of economic chaos from a no-deal Brexit, forecasting that the pound 
would depreciate by 25 per cent to the US dollar in a "disorderly" scenario.
In that case, inflation could skyrocket to 6.5 per cent, and unemployment to 7.5 per cent, while GDP could fall by 
nearly 8 per cent, the bank said.
Angry Brexiteers dismissed the two reports, while even pro-EU economist Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of 
England adviser, tweeted that the reputation of economic forecasts had "taken a bad blow."
Both forecasts appeared to "support political objectives," Sentance said. "Let's debate Brexit - which I strongly 
oppose - rationally without recourse to bogus forecasts."

Time's up for UK airports as Brexit looms large
Time's up for UK airports as Brexit looms large

Highlight: The clock is ticking as the UK moves towards the official Brexit date of March 2019, yet with only a few 
months to go, the situation looks anything but clear.
Body
While negotiations continue between Brussels and London, the prospect of a 'hard Brexit', a situation where the UK 
withdraws without a deal in place, is putting stakeholders in the aviation sector on high alert as key matters such as 
the single market and customs union are yet to be clarified. In June this year, European aircraft manufacturer 
Airbus sparked a wave of concern after announcing it could leave the UK in the event of a no-deal exit, while in 
September, uncertainty further escalated as Irish budget airline Ryanair said this scenario could lead it to be 
grounded for weeks. A recent report from US financial services company S&P Global Ratings titled 'Countdown to 
Brexit: The Growing Risks for UK Airports' has further fuelled concerns as it assesses the risks a no-deal divorce 
from the EU could bring to the British aviation industry. While the report's authors strongly emphasise that the 
chances of such a scenario becoming a reality are still low, the paper represents a serious warning to the industry 
as it reads: "The risk of a no-deal Brexit on March 30, 2019, [] has increased sufficiently to become a relevant rating 
consideration." An economic slowdown is loomingAccording to lead author and analyst Beata Sperling-Tyler, 
despite enjoying a positive period of traffic growth in the aftermath of Brexit, UK airports are likely to be affected by 
an economic slowdown and consequent drop in traffic rates. 
The period following the 2016 referendum saw a peak in tourism and passenger numbers, yet the paper highlights 
that traffic growth rates stabilised in the first quarter of 2018, with annual growth for Gatwick and Heathrow airports 
forecast to be between 0 and 2% in the coming months. "The most likely scenario will probably be an economic 
slowdown and a slowdown in traffic that will follow Brexit that to me is the highest risk," says Sperling-Tyler. "We 
know that traffic tends to follow the economic growth of a country so if there is a slowdown in the UK economy then 
there would be a slowdown in the traffic as well." However, the paper notes that despite the financial struggle, low 
private investment in the country and the prospect of an economic slowdown may eventually push the government 
to commit more funds to infrastructure projects. As the report puts it: "There seems to be widespread political 
support for additional growth of economic infrastructure assets, such as airports, which are drivers of growth and 
strategic gateways to the UK." The approval of Heathrow's third runway is a case in point. Troubled skies: British 
Time's up for UK airports as Brexit looms large
airports' troubleWhile support and more investment in improving local infrastructure is welcome news for airports, 
they could still end up paying a very high price in the event of a no-deal Brexit, says Sperling-Tyler. She stresses 
the fundamental importance to sign an agreement with the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA), which is 
crucial if the UK wishes to preserve air traffic rights. "Through the EU membership, the UK enjoys access to what 
we think is the most liberalised aviation market," she explains. "It gives access to 44 countries, accounting for about 
85% of all international traffic from Britain. The benefit of a free access to that market is that it helped a lot in 
developing and increasing competition in Europe and brought lower tariffs; especially thanks to the low-cost 
carriers, a greater number of routes have led to a very good growth for the airports and airlines both in Europe and 
in the UK." The Department for Transport recently published a set of guidelines for a contingency plan in the event 
of a no-deal scenario. The document explains that in this case, "airlines wishing to operate flights between the UK 
and the EU would have to seek individual permissions to operate from the respective states". This would mean that 
UK airlines would have to stipulate new agreements either with the EU as a whole or with each individual country. 
However, S&P Global Ratings CFA Tania Tsoneva explains that the likelihood of this scenario taking place is still 
quite low: "An effort will be made by the UK Government and by the EU representatives to ensure that the traffic will 
continue. In our article [] we pointed out that many airports in the EU are significantly exposed to UK passengers, so 
in the interest of both sides they will work to make sure that the traffic continues." Now more than ever, the fate of 
the country and its economy is in the hands of the government. This is not just a fact, but another reason for 
concern for airports' stakeholders, whose voice in the matter has little to no impact on the outcome of the 
negotiations. "The problem with airports is that they can't really do much other than participating in the meetings 
and lobbying, they can only observe what is happening," says Tsoneva. "They are more spectators of the situation." 
As a result, "they could be trying to attract airlines that would find them attractive from the point of view of 
destinations that they serve, or the type of aircraft that they operate." Some of them, she explains, could focus on 
offering long-haul flights and build new partnerships with the US and other transoceanic countries. The likelihood of 
this strategy was further confirmed during the latest budget announcement that took place in late October in the 
UK.Â British Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond announced the government's plan to introduce 
ePassport gates at Heathrow Airport for visitors coming from the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, 
as well as EEA members. A potentially safe landing for airlinesAirlines are in a slightly more comfortable situation: 
"They can adapt, they can take some contingency actions," explains Sperling-Tyler. Being essentially less 
dependent on the government, many of them have already started preparing for a no-deal scenario by developing 
ad hoc contingency plans and considering alternatives. The UK's expiring EU membership currently allows any 
airline predominantly owned by someone based in a member state to freely operate within the ECAA. If an 
agreement wasn't reached between the two political forces, airlines headquartered in the UK would no longer be 
able to operate in the EU. For this reason, budget airline easyJet was among the first to obtain a number of 
operating licenses in the continent. Ryanair also recently applied to obtain a similar certificate that would allow it to 
fly in and out of the UK come March 2019. Furthermore, the report claims that both the government and aviation 
industry stakeholders will do all in their power to make sure that operations continue smoothly. The British aviation 
sector, it says, "has made it clear its preference for maintaining access to the EU's Open Skies regime, which gives 
all EU airlines the right to fly between member states and domestically within member states." However, if such an 
access is not granted, the UK's Â£60bn aviation industry could struggle to spread its wings inside the EU.

Irish carrier Ryanair has taken delivery of its last new Boeing 737-800, a little over 20 years since it first ordered the 
jet.
In March 1998, Ryanair placed a firm order for 25 737-800s, the first of which joined the fleet the following year. 
This has since been added to by a series of follow-on orders from the pan-European low-cost giant.
Boeing on 14 December tweeted that the last of these aircraft had been delivered.
Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that Ryanair has a fleet of 440 737-800s, making it the largest airline operator of 737-
800s.
Ryanair in 2014 placed an order for 737 Max jets to cover its future fleet requirements. Deliveries of these begin 
next year. Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that Ryanair has 135 Max aircraft on order and holds options on a further 
75 of the type.

DOWNING Street yesterday denied reports that the government is to suggest families avoid booking holidays after 
29 March amid preparations for a no-deal Brexit.
The Sunday Times reported that a Cabinet minister is said to have explored the proposals with senior officials and 
the impact that the advice could have on specific tour operators. The newspaper quoted one source as saying the 
government was mulling covering losses to holiday companies. But a spokesperson for No 10 said the reports were 
"categorically untrue".
In September, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary warned that planes could be grounded for up to three weeks if the UK 
were to leave without a deal.
The European Commission said last week that while UK travellers would not need a visa after Brexit, they would 
have to pay up to (EURO)7 (£6.30) every three years to travel to EU countries.

Etihad facing claims of up to (EURO)2bn over Air Berlin collapse Airlines

Etihad is being sued for up to (EURO)2bn over its role in the bankruptcy of Air Berlin, a court in the German capital 
has said.
The Abu Dhabi-based airline was the main shareholder in Air Berlin, which declared insolvency in August 2017.
Air Berlin ran out of funds despite receiving a "comfort letter" from Etihad four months earlier. It declared that the 
carrier would provide backing to the lossmaking German airline over the following 18 months.
Etihad's announcement that it would no longer stand by that commitment was the trigger for Air Berlin's collapse, 
which prompted political recriminations and upheaval in Germany's aviation market.
Air Berlin had racked up losses of about (EURO)2bn in the six years leading up to its insolvency. The carrier, which 
struggled to compete with low-cost rivals such as Ryanair, had (EURO)1.2bn in net debt at the time.
In an attempt to recoup losses suffered by more than 1m claimants, Air Berlin's insolvency administrator is taking 
legal aim at Etihad.
According to a statement from the Berlin district court yesterday, the administrator "is of the opinion that [Etihad] 
gave a binding commitment. Because it violated that commitment, it should settle all the justified claims of 
creditors".
Etihad facing claims of up to (EURO)2bn over Air Berlin collapse Airlines
The administrator believes at least three separate claims worth (EURO)500m are justified. But given the large 
number of additional claimants, the court has provisionally estimated the overall value of the claims to be "up to 
(EURO)2bn".
Etihad has until the end of January to respond to the claims. The final decision over whether or not the claims are 
justified will be taken by the Berlin court. The collapse of Air Berlin was the largest aviation bankruptcy in German 
corporate history. It came at the height of the summer holiday season, sparking fears that hundreds of thousands of 
tourists could be left stranded.
The German government stepped in with a (EURO)150m bridge loan to keep the airline flying and win more time to 
find a buyer for the company's assets.

Ryanair (RYAAY) Stock Rating Upgraded by Zacks Investment Research

Dec 13, 2018( DailyPolitical: http://www.dailypolitical.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) was 
upgraded by Zacks Investment Research[1] from a "strong sell" rating to a "buy" rating in a research report issued 
on Tuesday. The brokerage currently has a $83.00 price objective on the transportation company's stock. Zacks 
Investment Research[2]'s target price indicates a potential upside of 11.80% from the stock's current price. 
According to Zacks, "Ryanair is being aided by strong demand for air travel, especially due to low air fares. Notably, 
traffic in November rose 11% year over year. We are also impressed by Ryanair's efforts to reward shareholders in 
the form of share buybacks. In tune with this, the carrier returned more than €540m to shareholders in the first six 
months of fiscal 2019. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
for third-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings being revised upward more than 100% in the last 60 days. We remain positive 
on the collective deals signed by the company with German Pilot union. On the flip side, continued labor unrest, 
high costs and other headwinds are expected to hurt Ryanair's results in third quarter. The stock has shed more 
than 28% of its value so far in the year mainly due to the labor unrest."RYAAY has been the topic of several other 
research reports. ValuEngine[3] upgraded shares of Ryanair from a "sell" rating to a "hold" rating in a report on

In a year of geopolitical drama, airlines – globe-trotting national champions that they are – felt some heat. Early 
shots in a simmering US-China trade war hit sector confidence, while the Trump administration’s move to reapply 
the sanctions thumbscrews on Iran ended that country’s airline growth story by halting delivery of much-needed 
new aircraft.
Business plans in Europe, meanwhile, are being written in pencil, owing to relentless Brexit uncertainty, with its 
catastrophic, less-bad-but-still-bad and best-but-still-costly possible outcomes – namely, no-deal and flights are 
grounded, bad-deal and major market enters long-term relative decline, or no-Brexit and start counting the cost of 
trying to put everything back together.
But it was the all-too-familiar dynamics of oil prices that really set the 2018 aviation scene. From mid-2016 to mid-
2017, the benchmark Brent crude per-barrel dollar price held a mid-40s to mid-50s range before starting a steady 
rise to a mid-80s peak in October 2018; prices then headed back towards the $60 mark, but a long run of high fuel 
costs had already figured in a string of second-half profit warnings.
Still, for the larger airline groups, 2018 has been a relatively profitable period. Smaller carriers had a rougher ride; 
failures included Primera Air, which aimed to connect several northern European and US cities but was grounded 
before it had really begun its bid to join the emerging long-haul, low-cost transatlantic market.
Elsewhere, it was another tough year in India, where over-capacity, fierce competition, rising costs and a weak 
currency continue to weigh on airlines. Weak currencies also hit Latin America, dragging down travel demand in 
Argentina and Brazil.
In North America, United Airlines’ aggressive expansion began to pay off in what remains a profitable market for 
most carriers. Indeed, United boasted rising third-quarter profits despite the fuel cost drag. Other relatively good 
news saw a long-running and ill-humoured USA versus Gulf states dispute over open skies and alleged government 
subsidies at least nominally resolved.
Oil prices weigh on profitability
But, true to form, the year’s dramatic turn revolved around Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary. Under pressure, he 
dropped a longstanding refusal to entertain unionisation only to discover that his pilots rather enjoy speaking with a, 
well, united voice. And, no surprise, they have grievances; strike action hit schedules, fares, bookings and

Ryanair's latest controversy brings "situation normal all fouled up" to mind. The low-cost Irish airline says it owes 
passengers no compensation for strike-related flight disruption this summer because this reflected "extraordinary 
circumstances". Cue hollow laughs from customers who regard a lousy service from Ryanair as entirely predictable. 
Cue, also, enforcement action from the UK's Civil Aviation Authority.
Ryanair's vulnerabilities have been mercilessly exposed by the dispute. The bosses of Europe's legacy flag carriers 
must be enjoying every minute. The company's exemplary margins have depended on toughness towards staff and 
customers. Damaging friction with both groups have shown how weak corporate governance standards are. 
Directors allowed a combative chief executive to push both relationships too far.
Higher fuel costs have not helped, contributing to a 9 per cent drop in half-year pre-tax profits to (EURO)1.3bn. 
Average fares have fallen 3 per cent to under (EURO)46. Margins have been squeezed 4 percentage points to 25 
per cent. Shares have fallen more than those of UK rival easyJet this year.
Labour relations are, in theory, improving. The company has agreed a deal with German pilots and is in 
negotiations with others.
The difficulty is that the jokey obstreperousness of Michael O'Leary lacks restraint. Rows with unions and regulators 
will recur too.
David Bonderman has been chairman for an incredible 22 years, weathering a censure vote this autumn. The whole 
board lacks independence and needs refreshing. A clear succession plan is needed for Mr O'Leary, an admirable 
entrepreneur who has been CEO since 1994.
Ryanair : winging it Twitter : @FTLex
The fight over compensation only adds to investor frustration. The decision of the airline to quit the UK' s aviation 
dispute resolution body is peevish and ill-judged.
It is unclear how much money is at stake. Assuming 60,000 passengers fill out the paperwork and make a claim for 
the minimum (EURO)250, then the airline might have to pay out (EURO)15m. Analysts who regard that as a 
modest cost of business are deluding themselves. It is a token of a bigger problem.
Ryanair has aspired to be a friendlier airline. Without a governance shake-up, that initiative will remain permanently 
grounded.

The UK Civil Aviation Authority has launched an enforcement action against Ryanair after the low-cost airline 
refused to compensate thousands of British customers for flight disruption over the summer.
Ryanair, whose passengers suffered delayed or cancelled flights because of eight days of strikes by pilots and 
cabin crew, said at the time that these were "extraordinary circumstances", which meant compensation was not 
payable.
But yesterday, the CAA said that passengers affected were entitled to payouts under the European Commission's 
regulation 261. People whose claims were rejected had been able to escalate complaints to AviationADR, a dispute 
resolution body approved by the CAA and used by many airlines. However, Ryanair has now cancelled its 
agreement with AviationADR, the CAA said. The CAA added that passengers who believed they had valid 
compensation claims for the summer disruption would now have to "await the outcome of the Civil Aviation 
Authority's enforcement action" before finding out if they will get any money back.
The CAA can ask for undertakings from businesses to make them comply with the law. It can go to court for an 
enforcement order if the business does not act or breaches undertakings.
Ryanair said: "Courts in Germany, Spain and Italy have already ruled that strikes are an 'exceptional circumstance' 
and EU261 compensation does not apply. We expect the UK CAA and courts will follow this precedent."
Ryanair hit by enforcement action over rejected payouts Airlines
However, the European Court of Justice ruled in April that wildcat strikes - rather than those agreed by a trade 
union - by staff of the TUIfly airline were subject to EU261 rules since conflicts with staff were "inherent" in business 
and were not extraordinary. "That rather takes you to the conclusion that the ECJ is going to be relatively 
unsympathetic to strikes by airline employees," said Simon Phippard of law firm Bird &Bird.
In 2017, Ryanair paid (EURO)25m in EU261 costs after it cancelled 2,000 flights in September and October 
because of rostering problems. The strikes this summer involved at least 650 cancellations, suggesting a bill of 
around (EURO)8m if the CAA is successful in its enforcement. See Lex

The UK Civil Aviation Authority has launched an enforcement action against Ryanair after the low-cost airline 
refused to compensate thousands of British customers for flight disruption over the summer.
Ryanair, whose passengers suffered delayed or cancelled flights because of eight days of strikes by pilots and 
cabin crew, said at the time that these were "extraordinary circumstances", which meant compensation was not 
payable.
But yesterday, the CAA said that passengers affected were entitled to payouts under the European Commission's 
regulation 261. People whose claims were rejected had been able to escalate complaints to AviationADR, a dispute 
resolution body approved by the CAA and used by many airlines. However, Ryanair has now cancelled its 
agreement with AviationADR, the CAA said. The CAA added that passengers who believed they had valid 
compensation claims for the summer disruption would now have to "await the outcome of the Civil Aviation 
Authority's enforcement action" before finding out if they will get any money back.
The CAA can ask for undertakings from businesses to make them comply with the law. It can go to court for an 
enforcement order if the business does not act or breaches undertakings.
Ryanair said: "Courts in Germany, Spain and Italy have already ruled that strikes are an 'exceptional circumstance' 
and EU261 compensation does not apply. We expect the UK CAA and courts will follow this precedent."

However, the European Court of Justice ruled in April that wildcat strikes - rather than those agreed by a trade 
union - by staff of the TUIfly airline were subject to EU261 rules since conflicts with staff were "inherent" in business 
and were not extraordinary. "That rather takes you to the conclusion that the ECJ is going to be relatively 
unsympathetic to strikes by airline employees," said Simon Phippard of law firm Bird &Bird.
In 2017, Ryanair paid (EURO)25m in EU261 costs after it cancelled 2,000 flights in September and October 
because of rostering problems. The strikes this summer involved at least 650 cancellations, suggesting a bill of 
around (EURO)8m if the CAA is successful in its enforcement. See Lex

BRITAIN'S largest housebuilders, banks and airline groups enjoyed a share-price bounce yesterday as investors 
took the view that a nodeal Brexit appears less likely. Property heavyweights such as Berkeley Group, Persimmon 
and Redrow were among the top 10 FTSE risers yesterday after a frantic 24 hours of political tussling in 
Westminster fuelled the possibility of a "softer" Brexit.
Blue-chip constituents Persimmon and Berkeley Group saw share prices close up seven and six per cent 
respectively, while FTSE 250 firm Redrow also climbed six per cent.
Meanwhile, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group saw shares rise by 2.4 per cent and 1.43 per cent 
respectively while airline firms EasyJet , Ryanair and British Airways owner International Airlines Group also ended 
the day higher.
This week's political developments signalled a creeping return to confidence in the City, with a research note 
published by JP Morgan forecasting a 40 per cent chance of the UK staying in the European Union.
Such an outlook from analysts comes on the back of Theresa May's three defeats in Parliament on Tuesday night, 
which prompted renewed speculation over the chances of another referendum or a pivot to membership of the 
European Economic Area.
"Events in Westminster have trumped a poor reading of economic activity in the services sector to lift the share 
prices of companies plugged into the domestic UK economy," said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves 
Lansdown. Khalaf added: "Housebuilding stocks in particular have risen in value as the market perceives greater 
parliamentary control over the Brexit process as likely to lead to a softer withdrawal from the EU.
MARKETS SENSE A SOFTER BREXIT Stocks lifted by investor bets that Brussels divorce will be amicable
Lloyds and RBS are also having a good day on the back of sunnier expectations for the UK economy". A successful 
amendment from Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve late on Tuesday means that MPs will likely be able to vote on 
what it wants the government to do if the Prime Minister fails to win a majority for her own deal, with the possibility 
that parliament could decide to take a "no deal" outcome off of the table.

The Civil Aviation Authority has launched an enforcement action against Ryanair after the low-cost airline refused to 
compensate thousands of British customers for flight disruption over the summer.
Ryanair, whose passengers suffered delayed or cancelled flights because of eight days of strikes by pilots and

But yesterday, the CAA said that passengers affected were entitled to payouts under the European Commission's 
regulation 261. People whose compensation claims were rejected had been able to escalate their complaints to 
AviationADR, a dispute resolution body approved by the CAA and used by many major airlines. However, Ryanair 
has now cancelled its agreement with AviationADR, the CAA said.
The CAA added that passengers who believed they had valid compensation claims for the summer disruption would 
now have to "await the outcome of the Civil Aviation Authority's enforcement action" before finding out if they would 
get any money back.
The CAA can ask for undertakings from businesses to make them comply with the law. It can go to court for an

However, the European Court of Justice ruled in April that wildcat strikes - rather than those agreed by a union - by

business and were not extraordinary.
"That rather takes you to the conclusion that the ECJ is going to be relatively unsympathetic to strikes by airline

In 2017, Ryanair paid (EURO)25m in EU261 costs after it cancelled 2,000 flights in September and October 
because of rostering problems. The strikes this summer involved at least 650 cancellations, suggesting a bill of 
around (EURO)8m if the CAA is successful in its enforcement. Ryanair noted in its most recent annual report that 
"passengers have a higher propensity to claim [under EU261] than in prior years".
The carrier has been engaged in negotiations with its unions since agreeing to recognise them in late 2017 after a 
rostering failure and staff shortage led to thousands of cancellations.
It has been making gradual progress in resolving its industrial relations problems which led to the summer strikes. 
At the end of November, it signed a framework agreement with its German pilots ahead of a collective labour 
agreement early next year, and it has reached collective labour agreements with cabin crew in Germany, Belgium 
and Italy. See Lex

 The following is a summary of top news stories Wednesday.----------COMPANIES----------Japan's Takeda 
Pharmaceutical announced its shareholders approved resolutions related to the proposed acquisition of Irish 
drugmaker Shire. Takeda said its proposal to delegate to the Takeda board the decision regarding the offering 
terms for the issuance of the new Takeda shares required to implement the deal was approved as originally 
proposed by at least 88% of the votes exercised in respect of this proposal. Takeda has now satisfied the 
shareholder approval condition required to implement the deal. The acquisition remains subject to approval by Shire 
shareholders at meetings expected to be held later Wednesday, and to the sanctioning of the Shire scheme of 
arrangement by the Jersey Court at a hearing expected to be held on January 3. It is expected that completion of 
the acquisition will take place on January 8. The last day of dealings for Shire shares on the London Stock 
Exchange will be Friday, January 4. Shire will be removed from the FTSE 100 index on Monday, January 7, 
according to index provider FTSE Russell.----------BT Group will strip Huawei Technologies Co's equipment from its 
core 4G network as government pressure to boycott the Chinese firm mounts, the Financial Times reported. 
BT's decision will bring its mobile network in line with an internal policy designed to keep the Chinese firm out of its 
telecoms infrastructure, the FT said. BT will, within two years, remove Huawei's technology from unit EE's network, 
which relied on the Chinese firm's kit to build its 3G and 4G network. World governments have started to become 
wary of Huawei, with the US, Australia and New Zealand blocking the use of the Chinese company's 5G equipment 
on "security grounds", as they are afraid of possible interference by China, the newspaper noted.----------The UK 
Civil Aviation Authority said it started enforcement action against Ryanair Holdings, after the budget airline refused 
to compensate customers affected by a long streak of summer strikes. The regulator said passengers who have 
made claims for compensation directly to the airline have seen them be rejected, as Ryanair decided under 
European Commission Regulation 261/2004 "financial compensation is not payable" with regards to its staff's 
industrial action. The CAA said passengers have been able to escalate their complaints to AviationADR, a body in 
charge of providing resolutions for complaints. However, the CAA said that Ryanair has now terminated its 
agreement with AviationADR, resulting in the regulator deciding to take action. Ryanair responded in a statement: 
"Courts in Germany, Spain and Italy have already ruled that strikes are an "extraordinary circumstance" and EU261 
compensation does not apply. We expect the UK CAA and Courts will follow this precedent."----------Stagecoach 
Group said it swung to a loss in the first half of its current financial year, but adjusted earnings were ahead of 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Government To Publish Full Brexit Legal Advice
expectations. The transport operator swung to a pretax loss of GBP22.6 million in the six months to October 27 
from GBP96.7 million profit reported for the same period a year earlier. Adjusted pretax profit declined by 10% to 
GBP87.0 million from GBP96.7 million year-on-year. The result was hurt by lower revenue, which fell by a third to

 The UK Civil Aviation Authority on Wednesday said it started enforcement action against Ryanair Holdings, after 
the budget airline refused to compensate customers affected by a long streak of summer strikes.
The regulator said that passengers who have made claims for compensation directly to the airline have seen them 
be rejected, as Ryanair decided that under European Commission Regulation 261/2004 "financial compensation is 
not payable" with regards to its staff's industrial action.
The CAA said that passengers have been able to escalate their complaints to AviationADR, a body in charge of 
providing resolutions for complaints. However, the CAA said that Ryanair has now terminated its agreement with 
AviationADR, resulting in the regulator deciding to take action.
Reiterating its view at the time of the strikes, the CAA said that in its opinion, "the strikes were not "extraordinary 
circumstances" and were not exempt, meaning consumers should be compensated in accordance with Regulation 
EC261/2004".
Ryanair shares were up 0.1% in early London trade.

 Stocks in London are set to open sharply lower on Wednesday following a slump in New York overnight that was 
tracked by Asian markets, with the optimism seen at the start of the week fading. 
In company news, Stagecoach said its interim results were ahead of expectations as it swung to a statutory loss, 
the UK civil aviation regulator has started enforcement action against Ryanair, and Patisserie Holdings has hired a 
new chief financial officer as the cafe chain works "tirelessly" to move on from its accounting scandal.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 50.06 points lower at 6,972.70 on Wednesday. 
The FTSE 100 closed down 39.65 points, or 0.6%, at 7,022.76 on Tuesday.
"Monday's stock market relief rally rather surprisingly ran out of legs fairly quickly yesterday, with some blaming the 
differences over the detail between the US version of what transpired at the weekend and the lack of any detail 
from the Chinese side with which to confirm it," said CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson.
He added: "This weakness strikes me as being overdone, particularly when you look at recent US data, however 
along with concerns about slowing global growth in China and Europe, along with rising geopolitical risk in Europe 
as well as last night's events in the UK parliament, its perhaps not surprising that investor nerves are a little frayed."
In the US on Tuesday, Wall Street ended deep in the red, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 3.1%, 
the S&P 500 3.2% and the Nasdaq Composite 3.8%.
In Asia on Wednesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index ended down 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite 
closed down 0.6%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is 1.7% lower in late trade.
The declines came despite positive economic data from China.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Stagecoach Ups Outlook Despite Interim Loss
The services sector in China continued to expand in November, and at a faster-than-expected pace, data showed. 
The latest survey from Caixin showed a PMI score of 53.8, beating expectations for the reading to be unchanged 
from October's 50.8.
The reading for November continued to rise further above the 50-mark, which indicates expansion in the sector. 
Individually, November marked the steepest increase in services activity in five months, while manufacturing 
production remained stable.
Japan's services PMI for November also remained above the 50-line but weakened from October. The services 
reading of 52.3 was down marginally from 52.4 in October. Individually, business activity continued to grow at a 
solid rate as demand conditions remained supportive. Confidence strengthened to a 10-month peak.
Shareholders of Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical approved the proposed acquisition of Irish drugmaker Shire.
The acquisition remains subject to approval by Shire shareholders at a meeting to be held later on Wednesday. It is 
expected that completion of the acquisition will take place on January 8. The last day of dealings for Shire shares 
on the London Stock Exchange will be Friday, January 4. Shire will be removed from the FTSE 100 index on 
Monday, January 7, according to index provider FTSE Russell.
In other company news, transport operator Stagecoach said adjusted earnings for its half-year were ahead of 
expectations, due to its Virgin Rail operations and a resolution to its former South West Trains franchise, though the 
firm swung to a loss on a statutory basis. 
Revenue for the half-year to October 27 was GBP1.23 billion, down from GBP1.79 billion a year ago, as adjusted 
pretax profit fell to GBP87.0 million from GBP96.7 million. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 12.9p, down from 
13.6p a year before. 
On a statutory basis, Stagecoach swung to a pretax loss of GBP22.6 million for the half from a GBP96.7 million 
profit last year. 
Operating profit for UK Rail was highlighted as being ahead of forecasts, despite profit for the unit falling 47% to 
GBP11.5 million from GBP21.7 million a year ago. The company said the fall reflected the expiry of the South West 
Trains franchise.
"The group is focused on making further progress in the second half of the year and we have increased our 
expectation of full-year adjusted earnings per share to reflect the above-forecast rail earnings in the first half of the 
year," said Chief Executive Martin Griffiths.
Stagecoach kept its interim dividend unchanged at 3.8 pence per share.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority said it has started enforcement action against Ryanair, following the budget airline's 
decision that compensation is not payable for the flight disruptions caused by industrial action by its staff members 
over the summer. 
Ryanair passengers have made claims for compensation directly to the airline, but these have been rejected, the 
CAA said. Passengers had been able to escalate their complaints to AviationADR, a body approved by the CAA, to 
provide alternative resolutions for these complaints. 
However, Ryanair has now informed the CAA that it has terminated its agreement with AviationADR.
CAA reiterated its view at the time of the industrial action that the strikes were not "extraordinary circumstances", 
which means consumers should be compensated in accordance with European Commission Regulation 261/2004.
John Wood Group said it has been awarded at USD43 million contract by a "large-cap midstream company" to 
construct 80 miles of steel pipeline in west Texas.

Monks Investment Trust said it underperformed the FTSE World Index in its first half, with media investor Naspers 
and financial services firm Prudential among the larger drags on the portfolio. 
Monks Investment said it produced a negative net asset value total return of 0.9% in the six months to October 31, 
compared with a 4.5% increase for the FTSE World Index. Health insurer Anthem and online retail platform Amazon 
were "notable positive contributors" to absolute returns, while Naspers and Prudential dragged. 
Embattled cake maker Patisserie Holdings has appointed former CVS Group Finance Director Nick Perrin as 
interim chief financial officer.
"I am pleased to welcome Nick to Patisserie Holdings. He brings with him the necessary experience to help 
strengthen the team as the company works tirelessly to put the events of the past months behind it and look forward 
to the future," said Chief Executive Steve Francis. 
The cafe chain has been struggling since discovering in October a GBP20 million black hole in its financial accounts 
due to potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities. Former Finance Director Chris Marsh was suspended by the 
company after the irregularities were found. He since was arrested and released on bail. Marsh subsequently 
resigned from Patisserie.
To come in the economic calendar on Wednesday, there are services PMIs from France, Germany, the eurozone 
and the UK at 0850 GMT, 0855 GMT, 0900 GMT and 0930 GMT respectively. There are also eurozone retail sales 
at 1000 GMT.
Markets in the US will be closed on Wednesday in honour of former US President George HW Bush, whose funeral 
is taking place.
In the UK, Theresa May is battling to keep her Brexit agenda on track as MPs are again set to clash over the UK 
prime minister's EU withdrawal plan after inflicting major defeats on the government.
As the Commons prepares for a second of five days of debate on May's controversial Brexit deal on Wednesday, a 
Tory former chief whip broke ranks and said he would vote against the proposals.
Mark Harper, who backed Remain in the referendum, insisted the EU agreement would leave the UK worse off. 
Forecasting that May would lose the crunch Brexit vote next Tuesday by more than 80 votes, Harper urged the PM 
to renegotiate the deal.
The comments came in the wake of a humiliating set of Commons defeats for May which saw the government 
forced to allow MPs to have a say in what happens next if the Brexit deal is voted down next week.
Ministers also had to agree to publish the "final and full" legal advice to Cabinet on the withdrawal agreement as the 
government was found to be in contempt of Parliament for not already doing so.

Britain's aviation authority said it would take legal action to force Irish budget airline Ryanair to pay compensation to 
customers affected by strikes by its staff this summer.
The UK's Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement on Wednesday that the strikes were not exempt from the EU's 
261 rules on compensation and it had started enforcement action against the airline.
Ryanair was hit by a number of strikes this year by cabin crew and pilots, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of 
flights and disrupting travel plans of more than 100,000 customers. Responding to the CAA's 
statement, Ryanair said that it believed that compensation was not payable in the case of strikes.
"Courts in Germany, Spain and Italy have already ruled that strikes are an 'extraordinary circumstance' and EU261 
compensation does not apply. We expect the UK CAA and courts will follow this precedent," a spokesman 
for Ryanair said.
Enforcement action is when the CAA seeks legal undertakings from operators to ensure they change their policies 
and comply with the law.
Analysts at Goodbody noted that rival airlines Lufthansa and IAG's British Airways had not been obliged to pay out 
EU 261 compensation due to strikes their staff had recently held. (Reuters)

Britain's aviation regulator on Wednesday announced legal action against budget airline Ryanair over its refusal to 
pay compensation to passengers affected by strikes this summer.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it had launched enforcement action after the airline refused to 
compensate passengers whose flights were cancelled due to strikes by Ryanair staff.
Ryanair deemed the strikes "unreasonable" and claimed this meant the tens of thousands of passengers affected 
by hundreds of flight cancellations across Europe were not entitled to compensation under EU regulations.
The CAA said it rejected the airline's claim that the industrial action, organized by trade unions, constituted 
"extraordinary circumstances" that could be exempt from the compensation provisions.
Under EU legislation for flight cancellations, an airline should pay 250 euros (293 dollars) to each passenger, 
unless they are informed at least two weeks in advance or are offered alternative flights arriving at their destination 
the same day.
An airline can withhold compensation if it can show that the cancellation is "caused by extraordinary circumstances 
which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken," according to the rules.
Ryanair argued in late July that no compensation was payable "when the union is acting unreasonably and totally 
beyond the airline's control."

Ryanair is facing enforcement action from the UK’s civil aviation regulator, after the carrier rejected compensation 
claims from passengers over strike disruption.
While airlines would be exempt from paying compensation under circumstances ruled ‘extraordinary’, the Civil 
Aviation Authority has previously expressed a view that strike action does not count as such.
It states that passengers with rejected claims had been able to escalate complaints to an approved dispute-
resolution organisation called AviationADR. But Ryanair has told the CAA that it has “terminated” its agreement with 
AviationADR, says the regulator.
The CAA says it started enforcement action against Ryanair on 5 December.
“Passengers who have made strike-related compensation claims via AviationADR are advised that these claims are 
currently on hold,” it says, adding that they will need to await the outcome of the enforcement measures.
Ryanair stated in its half-year financial results to 30 September that its marketing, distribution and other costs had 
risen by 15% primarily as a result of higher compensation arising from disruptions and cancellations.
It has yet to respond publicly to the CAA enforcement decision.
Ryanair has suffered disruption over the summer both from air traffic control strikes and, it says, "limited" industrial 
action by its own staff.
European Court of Justice judges had ruled earlier this year that a ‘wildcat’ strike by German carrier TUIfly’s crews, 
which disrupted its operations, could not be counted as an extraordinary circumstances – thereby obliging the 
airline to pay compensation.

This ruling had gone against an original advocate general opinion that such strikes could be considered 
extraordinary if the airline had taken reasonable measures to avoid them.

LONDON (AP) - Britain's airline regulator is seeking to force Ryanair to pay compensation for flights that were 
cancelled or delayed by a series of worker strikes after Europe's biggest discount carrier said it wasn't required to 
pay thousands of claims under European Union rules.
The Civil Aviation Authority says it has begun enforcement action against Ryanair after the airline ignored the 
regulator's ruling that the strikes were not "extraordinary circumstances" as defined by EU rules. Airlines aren't 
obliged to pay compensation for delays caused by extraordinary events such as bad weather.
The regulator also says Wednesday that Ryanair has terminated its agreement with an arbitration service hired to 
settle disputes over compensation. As a result, anyone who has filed a claim will have to wait until the enforcement 
action is completed.

 The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has initiated enforcement action against Irish budget carrier Ryanair 
(RYAAY) over its decision not to pay compensation for flight cancellations caused by staff strikes, media reported.
The low-cost carrier was hit by its worst ever strikes in the summer after pilots and cabin crew staged walkouts over 
a disagreement regarding pay and benefits. The disruption caused flight cancellations to major destinations in what 
is considered as the busiest time of the year.
The agency said that the company has rejected passengers' compensation claims. It also ended an agreement with 
AviationADR, a legal services provider approved by the CAA to conduct alternative dispute resolution of passenger 
complaints, according to media sources.
The CAA argues that passengers are entitled to compensation under EU law. Ryanair rejects this view, saying that 
the disruption was due to "exceptional circumstances" and therefore exempt.

Ryanair and its German pilots' union have reached a framework agreement for a labour deal - including a doubling 
of base pay for some pilots - to end a year-long spell of industrial unrest.
The pilots have won one of their key demands, which was to be employed under German rather than Irish law, thus 
securing local labour protections and tax arrangements. The budget airline has been engaged in negotiations with 
its unions around Europe since agreeing to recognise them in late 2017 after a rostering failure and staff shortage 
led to thousands of cancellations. Josh Spero

 The European markets ended Tuesday's session in the red. 
Following yesterday's rally, investors took an opportunity to lock in some profits. Traders reacted positively to the 
trade war truce reached by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit over the 
weekend.
However, uncertainty about whether the 90-day truce will give the US and China enough time to reach a long-term 
trade agreement appears to have inspired traders to cash in on Monday's strong upward move.
News that US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, one of Trump's more hawkish advisors on trade with China, 
has been tapped to lead the negotiations has added to the skepticism.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened 0.8%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
decreased 0.8%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.4%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 1.1% and the CAC of France fell 0.8%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 0.6% and 
the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.2%.
In Paris, JCDecaux sank 2.9% after a brokerage downgrade.
In London, low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings fell 1.8% after reporting positive traffic figures for November.
Ferguson, a specialist distributor of plumbing and heating products, tumbled 4.3% despite the company posting 
solid first-quarter results.
IG Group Holdings sank 9.7% after the online trading company said it expects revenue in the first half to be around 
6.0% lower than last year.
Danske Bank AS slid 0.1% in Copenhagen. The bank said it has built a capital buffer of as much as USD2.7 billion 
to absorb potential fines in a money laundering case.

Eurozone producer price inflation accelerated further in October, defying expectations, figures from Eurostat 
showed Tuesday. Producer prices rose 4.9% year-on-year after a revised 4.6% in September. Economists had 
expected the rate to remain unchanged at September's original figure of 4.5%.
British construction sector expanded at the fastest pace in four months in November, thanks to an increase in new 
work and consequent gains in job creation, though Brexit concerns damped expectations for the months ahead.
The CIPS construction Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to 53.4 from 53.2 in October, survey data from IHS

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - European stocks fell on Tuesday, as confused signals over 
U.S.-China trade talks as well as a broadly weaker dollar prompted traders to unlock some profits after the previous 
session's strong rally.  Italy continued to be in focus after the country's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the 
revised budget would be ready in the coming hours.  The British pound jumped after a senior EU law officer said the 
U.K. could halt Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50.  The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 
0.34 percent at 359.96 in opening deals after rallying 1 percent in the previous session. 
  The German DAX and France's CAC 40 index were down around 0.6 percent, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was 
losing 0.4 percent.   Falling U.S. yields on expectations of slower pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve pulled 
down financials, with banks Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale all 
falling over 1 percent.   Danske Bank A/S advanced 0.7 percent. The Danish bank said it has built a capital buffer of 
as much as $2.7bn (\xA42.38bn) to absorb potential fines in a money laundering case.   JCDecaux slumped 4.3

Anyone who has closely followed the troubled history of Alitalia could be forgiven for developing a distinct sense of 
deja vu after reports emerged that state-owned rail company Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane is lining up to take over 
the ailing flag carrier.
In the latest reports, Alitalia’s state-appointed commissioners are understood to have reacted positively to the 
publicly-owned rail operator’s bid for the company, which was one of three it received in October at the close of the 
final tender process to privatise the carrier.
The Italian media has also indicated that Ferrovie is already in talks with other operators, including EasyJet, to 
potentially come on board in its planned relaunch of the airline.
history repeating
But Alitalia has been here before: in 2008 when it was state owned and then in 2013-2014 when in private hands.
In each case, Italian industrial and finance companies rallied round – or at least were persuaded to by the 
government of the day – and provided emergency funding to stabilise the airline, before another company stepped 
in to assume ownership.
In 2009, that was a consortium of Italian business, and in 2014, it was Gulf carrier Etihad. In both cases Alitalia was 
relaunched, only to find that in the interim, the market had moved and greater competition – particularly from low-
cost carriers – had eaten into its market share.
A retrenching Etihad finally pulled the plug in May 2017, precipitating another extraordinary administration and sale 
process.
Can sale set Alitalia on the right track- Emba t tled airline's new owner must build ties with rivals and rationalise 
cost base to ensure it is commercially via....
Given that history, can Ferrovie succeed where others have failed?
Its long-haul links to the USA are a key asset, but having let commercial relationships with Air France-KLM cool 
under Etihad’s stewardship, Alitalia finds itself excluded from an expanded transatlantic alliance that also includes 
Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic.
While Alitalia has been assailed by low-cost carriers on short-haul and domestic routes for many years, its long-haul 
business had previously been relatively spared.
However, Norwegian is offering a number of transatlantic routes from the Italian capital, and Qatar Airways-backed 
Air Italy – the former Meridiana – now has several long-haul services from Milan.
But a long-haul partnership could still be possible. A new chief executive at Air France-KLM may consider rekindling 
its relationship with Alitalia. And, Delta is strongly tipped as the third bidder for the Italian flag carrier.
It is Alitalia’s short-haul business, though, that is the most obvious place for the rail operator to make significant 
changes.
The airline has been steadily losing market share to low-cost competitors, notably EasyJet and Ryanair. Figures 
released by Italian civil aviation authority ENAC show that in 2017, Alitalia was only the second-largest airline by 
passengers in Italy, and the third-largest for international passengers, behind Ryanair and EasyJet.
Even on domestic routes, Alitalia, at 12.2 million passengers, was only a whisker ahead of Ryanair, with its figure of 
11 million.
If correct, Ferrovie’s reported talks with the UK low-cost carrier regarding a future partnership make plenty of sense. 
EasyJet has always said it is interested in bits of Alitalia’s business, primarily short-haul flying, and could be brought 
in to manage that operation.
With EasyJet as an ally, Alitalia could seek to shore up its business against other low-cost competition.
But a partnership with EasyJet would be subject to a certain tension: Alitalia would not wish to give up short-haul 
flying entirely, while the UK low-cost carrier is a hard-nosed business and would seek to wring as much profit as it 
could from the relationship.
Counting against Alitalia is the growing presence of Ryanair, Wizz and other operators – an expanding Lufthansa 
Group is another example – in its core short-haul markets.
As the parent company of Italy’s primary train operator – Trenitalia – it is not unreasonable to suppose that Ferrovie 
could be planning to develop unprecedented levels of co-operation between air and rail schedules in the country.
train in vain
Trenitalia runs both regional and high-speed lines across Italy and theoretically could work with Alitalia to help feed 
passengers on to its domestic, European or international network and vice versa. In addition, it is likely to cut 
domestic air routes that are already well served by high-speed rail.
Peter Morris, chief economist at Flight Ascend Consultancy, says there is potential for a rail-air tie-up to be 
successful, but questions whether the benefits are “of a scale to justify taking on responsibility for the recovery of 
Alitalia’s parlous business and profitability position.”
The prospects for success could hinge on the political agenda of Ferrovie’s ultimate owner, the Italian government. 
The stridently nationalist coalition government of the Five Star Movement and right-wing League has made no 
secret of its desire to keep Alitalia as a national asset with public participation.
Can sale set Alitalia on the right track- Emba t tled airline's new owner must build ties with rivals and rationalise 
cost base to ensure it is commercially via....
While state backing carries some benefits – organising rescue loans and finding new sources of funding, as well as 
strong-arming troublesome unions – meddling by politicians in commercial matters seldom ends well. The launch of 
another state-aid probe by Brussels could also not be ruled out.
Ferrovie has not yet won the bidding for Alitalia, but if it does gain control it is clear that a new strategy will be 
needed.
Greater participation by partner airlines and a firm willingness to reform the company’s structures and cut the 
workforce could be crucial if the Alitalia cycle is to be broken.

Shares in Stobart Group, the miniconglomerate weighing a bid for the UK regional airline Flybe, fell more than 10 
per cent after the company cut its fourth-quarter dividend.
The next quarter's dividend will be 1.5p compared with 4.5p for the past three months. The total payout in the 2018 
financial year will be 15p, down from 16.5p the previous year.
The company, whose assets include Southend airport and a biomass business, said it had paid £105m in dividends 
since March 2017 through the disposal of "non-strategic assets".
It concluded that it was "prudent financial discipline" to use future disposals to invest in opportunities to gen-erate 
cash. Stobart needs to ensure that it has sufficient resources to pay for Flybe, which has a market cap of £43m, and 
cutting the dividend would help. It failed in a bid for Flybe earlier this year.
Stobart declined to comment on its plans for Flybe, but said it needed to invest in Southend airport as Ryanair was 
launching flights from there next summer. It said it was also considering opportunities in the energy sector.
Stobart's pre-tax loss increased by almost half to £17.5m in the six months to the end of August, capping a difficult 
period featuring a boardroom battle and a shareholder revolt against the chairman.
The company has operated a franchise agreement with Flybe at Southend airport and spent £18m developing and 
promoting it - but announced in Octo-ber that it was closing the deal after less than two years.
'Prudent' Stobart tumbles after dividend cut Industrials
It said the cause was Flybe rivals easyJet and Ryanair expanding their presence at the airport.
Stobart has been arguing over the details of the Flybe bid in court. The company sued Andrew Tinkler, its own 
former chief executive, for allegedly breaching his fiduciary duties.
It alleged that he wanted to derive personal financial benefit from the Flybe and related transactions; Mr Tinkler said 
Stobart did not have the cash to pay for the takeover. He denied all Stobart's claims.
The company's case finished last week, with judgment not expected this year.
Its shares were down nearly 12 per cent to 174.4p yesterday.

BERLIN (AP) - A union representing German pilots says it has reached a preliminary agreement with Ryanair to 
sign collective labor agreements by early 2019 and that won't be any further strikes until then.
The Ireland-based budget airline has seen strikes by various groups of employees in recent months. Ryanair built 
its low-cost business model without unions, but said last year that it would recognize them.
Germany's Cockpit union said Tuesday that the two sides intend to sign four agreements based on German labor 
law by March, and that an employee council will be set up. It added that "until then, no industrial action will be 
taken."
The union said that, by February, all pilots based in Germany will be subject to contracts under German rather than 
Irish law.

Highlight: Shares in Ryanair have lost nearly a quarter of their value this year but Citywire AA-rated Tom Walsh is 
sticking by the budget airline group.
Body
Citywire AA-rated fund manager Tom Walsh is sticking with Ryanair (RYA.I), one of his top holdings in the Baillie 
Gifford European  fund, despite a tough year for the stock.
Ryanair is a top 10 holding in the £454 million fund, which Walsh manages with Citywire AA-rated Stephen Paice 
and Moritz Sitte.
The shares have lost nearly a quarter of their value this year, as the broader airline sector has struggled, while the 
budget airline group has dealt with its own issues with staff strikes.
An oil price that rallied from around $66 a barrel at the start of the year to $86 by October had weighed on the 
sector, with respite coming only in the last two months as the price of Brent crude has tumbled.
Walsh, whose fund sits fourth in the Investment Association's Europe ex-UK sector over three years, up 40.5%, 
said he was still backing the stock. 
‘Ryanair has been a tremendously successful company over a very long time period and it’s a company we expect 
to succeed into the future,' he said.
‘We know how many aircrafts are being delivered, we know what their aspirations are of filling those aircrafts and 
their track record in doing so.
‘We know they have the lowest cost base in the industry and a proven ability to grow without letting that cost base 
expand too rapidly.’
Walsh (pictured) challenged the view that ‘innovation and disruption’ could not be found in Europe.
‘There’s this overall perception of Europe as this sort of creaking, old continent that’s lumbering steadily from one 
crisis to the next,' he said.
‘That’s the big picture, that’s the macro and political view… many people start with the big picture and when they 
look at it, they come back with some pretty negative messages and that’s quite a hard starting point to come from.
Strike strife won't dent Europe star's Ryanair backing
‘[But] I think that’s absolutely the wrong way to approach European investing. I think the reality is that for a bottom-
up investor Europe remains a fantastic place to find overlooked companies offering tremendously attractive long-
term investment returns.
‘If you know where to look you can find some fantastically innovative and disruptive businesses operating within 
Europe.’
Disrupters the fund holds include a new 2.6% holding in Spotify (SPOT.K), the music streaming service that is 
listed in the US but with headquarters in Sweden. 
Others include online pet food platform Zooplus (ZO1.DE), with a 2.3% holding and 3.1% in biopharma equipment 
producer Sartorius (SRT.DE).
But Walsh has missed out on German payment platform Wirecard (WDI.DE), which has helped to power gains for 
Citywire A-rated Alexander Darwall's  Jupiter European  fund and Jupiter European Opportunities (JEO ) 
investment trust.
‘[It’s] a company we’ve never owned and we were wrong not to,' said Walsh.
The manager added the Europe team had been analysing payments companies but that it was ‘hugely complicated’ 
sector, with the eventual winners over the next decade hard to identify.
‘It’s an area we’ve struggled on but it’s an area we’ve been looking at,’ he said.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) said pre-market Tuesday that it has entered into a framework agreement with the German pilot 
union Vereinigung Cockpit covering a four-year deal that includes wages and benefits as the low-cost airliner 
attempts to settle a year-long dispute with staff that led to strike action.
"These signed agreements deliver basic pay increases, Ryanair's industry-leading 5 on 4 off roster, and apply 
German labour law for all Ryanair's German based pilots," the Irish budget carrier said.
The company also announced that November traffic increased 11% to 10.4 million passengers with a 96% load 
factor. The uptick was due to lower fares and the launch of its winter schedules. Traffic rose 8% to 10.1 million 
customers with a 96% load factor. Traffic at subsidiary Laudamotion was 300,000 customers with a 93% load 
factor.
"We operated over 56,000 scheduled flights in Nov with over 88% of flights arriving on time, as Ryanair continues to 
deliver the lowest fares, with the best punctuality of any major EU airline," said chief marketing officer Kenny 
Jacobs.

Ryanair on Tuesday announced it had reached a framework agreement with German pilot union VC on wages and 
benefits in a breakthrough in its efforts to bring a year-old staff revolt to an end.
VC was responsible for Ryanair's first ever pilot strike in December last year.
Ryanair, which has faced a series of strikes across Europe this year, has said it hopes to come to agreements with 
unions in its main markets before the end of March.
The four-year deal includes agreements on pay, pension, pilot allowances and annual leave and will be fleshed out 
in detailed documents to be signed by the end of February, Europe's biggest low cost airline said.
"While it is not a full CLA (collective labor agreement) yet, this is clear progress by Ryanair and the VC union, which 
has been one of the more troublesome unions to date," Goodbody airlines analyst Mark Simpson said in a note.
"Given the progress it looks as it fears over a German strike at Christmas are now unlikely," he said.
Ryanair shares were up 1.3% at 11.67 euros at 0810 GMT. (Reuters)

Body
Ryanair and Germany's Cockpit pilots' union (VC) have agreed the major points of a settlement in their pay dispute, 
averting strike action ahead of the Christmas holiday season, both sides announced in Frankfurt on Tuesday.
The pay deal, which will run to March 2023, is set to be in place by the end of February next year.
"I'm very optimistic on this," VC's Ingolf Schumacher told dpa.
The more than 400 Ryanair pilots stationed in Germany went on strike for the first time a little under a year ago and 
stopped work three times over the course of 2018.
Under the tentative agreement, starting co-pilots are to receive fixed pay of 50,000 euros (57,000 dollars), an 
effective doubling in pay, while captains will see a smaller percentage rise to 100,000 euros.
Europe's largest budget carrier is to employ its German-based pilots under German law from the end of February, 
Schumacher said.
The Dublin-based carrier flies its Boeing 737s to more than 215 airports in 37 countries, operating from 86 bases in 
Europe and North Africa.
Last month, it struck a deal with the German union Verdi on cabin crew pay.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. stocks fell modestly on Tuesday, as confused signals over 
U.S.-China trade talks as well as the pound's rise versus a broadly weaker dollar prompted traders to unlock some 
profits after the previous session's strong rally.  The British pound jumped after a senior EU law officer said the U.K. 
could halt Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50.  The benchmark FTSE 100 was down 23 points or 0.33 percent 
at 7,040 in opening deals after closing 1.2 percent higher the previous day.   Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings rose 
half a percent after reporting positive traffic figures for November.   Ferguson, a specialist distributor of plumbing 
and heating products, tumbled 3.2 percent despite the company posting solid first-quarter results.   IG Group 
Holdings lost 2.6 percent after the online trading company said it expects revenue in the first half to be around 6 
percent lower than last year.  Enterprise software company Sage Group advanced 0.8 percent after it appointed

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Stobart Group Limited (STOB.L) said that the operational progress has continued during 
the second half and the Group is trading in line with expectations.  The Group said it has continued to progress its 
growth plans for Stobart Aviation, which reported a 37% year-on-year increase in passenger numbers at London 
Southend Airport, and Stobart Energy, which reported a 72% year-on-year increase in tonnes supplied at the time 
of its Interim Results in October.  The expansion opportunities at London Southend Airport are increasingly evident 
in view of the opportunities arising from the commercial agreements with Ryanair and easyJet, together with other 
airline partners. The agreements provide confidence that the airport will record significantly increased passenger 
numbers from next year, with the Group targeting 5 million passengers from 2022 at 10 pounds  EBITDA per 
passenger, Stobart said.  The company said its board intends to reduce the fourth-quarter dividend to 1.5 pence per 
share. This means that the total dividend paid in the current financial year is 15 pence per share (previous financial 
year: 16.5 pence per share).  A dividend of 1.5 pence per share will be paid on 31 January 2019 to shareholders on 
the register as at 11 January 2019.

The Cast Courts Victoria and Albert Museum London What is the difference between an original, a copy, a 
reproduction, a fake, a facsimile? The V&A's 35-metre plaster of the Roman "Trajan's Column" was cast from 
electrotyped sections made by Leopold Oudry in Paris in 1864, commissioned by Napoleon. It is the showstopper of 
the magnificently renovated West Gallery, opening today (and renamed the Ruddock Family Cast Court). Other star 
casts are the 12th century Pórtico de la Gloria from Santiago de Compostela, Peter Vischer's 16th century tomb 
from Nuremberg, and the rood screen of Walcourt's St Materne Basilica, 1531, cast in 17 interlocking pieces in 
Belgium in 1902. Monumental yet ghostly presences, these replicas, set in the splendid gallery restored to its 19th 
century pink-purple and olive hues, with glazed roof and ceramic tiles - created by Victorian women prisoners - form 
a unique palimpsest: ancient and Renaissance art, reproduced by 19th century artisans, amassed as a Victorian 
hodgepodge of epochs and styles, for audiences who would never experience the originals.
This and the Weston Cast Court (reopened 2014), are the museum's largest galleries, the only ones displaying the 
same objects as when they were launched in 1873, and among very few surviving cast collections worldwide; most 
were dispersed when this art form - and learning by copying - tumbled from fashion in the mid-20th century. Now 
taste has come full circle; much conceptual art, from Duchamp to Rachel Whiteread's casts, deals in simulacra, 
pastiche, appropriation, replication. In the Ryanair age, the Cast Courts remain theatrical and exciting, while a new 
"interpretation" gallery - including a 3D printed reproduction of a Palmyra arch, destroyed by Isis, and casts from the 
Tuileries Palace burnt down by the Paris Commune in 1871 - demonstrate why copies matter, as documents, and 
aesthetically. www.vam.ac.uk, from December 1 Umberto Boccioni Estorick Collection, London Two sparkling loans 
from Turin's Intesa Sanpaolo collection, "Three Women" and "Factories at Porta Romana", each on the cusp 
between divisionism and futurism, transform the Estorick's holding of this versatile modernist. They are shown here 
in a superb one-room display featuring realist and cubist drawings, the rushing tempera sketch "The City Rises", 
Visual arts Jackie Wullschlager
and the still bizarre expressionist shocker "Modern Idol". Together they trace Boccioni's dizzying development from 
1907-12.
www.estorickcollection.com to January 20 Gainsborough's Family Album National Portrait Gallery, London All the 
painter's pictures of his wife, beloved daughters, disappointed father, eager nephews in Van Dyck suits: a parade of 
middle class provincial Georgian England steps out here, animated by Gainsborough's rapturous manner of soft, 
caressing strokes and blended colour.            www.npg.org.uk, to February 3 Bloomberg New Contemporaries 
South London Gallery Some 57 emerging artists in all media were selected for this well-established annual open 
submission show (alumni include Damien Hirst, Glen Brown, and Katy Moran, a 2018 judge). Emphatic this year is 
political content: Brexit, post-colonialism (Kamile Ofoeme's audio piece "FF Gaiden: Black Death"), feminism and 
reproductive politics (Viviana Troya's ceramic Virgin Mary heads as eggs in an incubator "Hatchery"), migration, 
diasporas 
(Rebecca 
Harper's 
large 
scale 
yet 
intimiste, 
lyrically 
drawn 
paintings).

40 artists and activists are shown: from Judy Chicago, Zoe Leonard, Ana Mendieta, Faith Ringgold to littleknown 
collectives. www.nottinghamcontempoary.org to January 27 Oceania Royal Academy, London Hundreds of works 
spanning half a millennium from New Zealand, Polynesia, Melanesia, Micronesia; shell, greenstone and ceramic 
ornaments; enormous canoes; monumental images of gods; contemporary works exploring identity and climate 
change. Final week.            www.royalacademy.org.uk to December 10 Richard Smith: Uptown/ Downtown 1959-63 
Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert, London Last days too for this bright, energetic, revelatory show of the unsung contemporary 
of David Hockney and Peter Blake. Smith was the first British artist of that generation to work in the US, fusing 
abstraction and pop in witty, sensuous, large-scale, high/low compositions.            www.hh-h.com, to December 14

Nov 27, 2018( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A retired 
firefighter on board an Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle to Kona, Hawaii, on Monday saved an elderly woman's life 
by helping the crew use the automated external defibrillator (AED) device on the plane after she went into cardiac 
arrest. Alaska Airlines Flight 843 was then diverted to San Francisco International Airport. The emergency crew that 
waited at the airport transported the woman to a hospital. 
Officials said the woman was stable, NBC Bay Area[1] reported.The officials also said the firefighter was from 
Bellingham, Washington. The plane was two-and-a-half hours into the flight when the incident occurred. Airport 
authorities had earlier confirmed the Alaska Airlines flight made an emergency landing due to a medical emergency 
after an elderly female was unresponsive on the plane. Additional information was not available. In a similar incident 
in September, a firefighter on board a Ryanair flight saved an elderly woman who suddenly fell ill. Daniel, the 
firefighter, took notice of the woman's ailing condition and checked her pulse. He took immediate action after he 
realized the woman had no heartbeat. He moved the passenger to a better location, performed CPR and used 
defibrillating paddles. This improved her oxygen levels and saved her life. Daniel later called it a 'daunting situation' 
and said the woman's sudden unconsciousness was caused by bleeding in the brain, Magic Mum[2] reported. A

suffered a cardiac arrest. In the image, Alaska Airlines planes are seen at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport,

Homer, a firefighter from Dallas, Texas, helped save a woman's life using things he found around the plane after 
she fell unconscious. The firefighter was 30 minutes into his flight to Mexico when he saw a woman unconscious in 
the seat behind him. He picked her up, laid her on the floor and asked other passengers to elevate her feet. He 
examined the woman and realized the situation was urgent. "She did bottom out, that's a term that's used where 
her blood pressure dropped, blood sugar was low. It can be pretty bad. You can go into shock. A lot of things can 
happen during that time when a person's blood pressure bottoms out,' he told WFAA.[3] He then obtained a blood 
pressure monitor from a nurse who was on the plane and a blood sugar monitor from a diabetic passenger. He 
performed CPR, gave the woman oxygen and stayed by her side until she regained consciousness. The flight 
landed two hours later at Mexico airport where an ambulance was waiting. Homer was honored by the fire 
department when he returned. "I think God puts us in certain situations in certain times, I think that's why I was on 
that flight in that particular seat. It's not a coincidence that I was there,' Homer said. [ 1]:

T aking on one of the world's most aggressively protectionist business environments is not for the faint of heart. So 
far, airline industry veteran Julian Cook - who aspires to do in Argentina what Ryanair's Michael O'Leary achieved 
in Europe - has managed to stand his ground.
As chief executive and co-founder of Flybondi, Argentina's first low-cost domestic airline, Mr Cook runs one of the 
most high-profile, disruptive companies emboldened by the centre-right president Mauricio Macri's promise to open 
Argentina up to competition. He has, unsurprisingly, come under attack. Trade unions, the media and local 
communities have all put up resistance. In spite of the threats, denigration and obstructions, the 45-year-old yoga 
enthusiast remains disarmingly serene. But he cannot resist taking a swipe at the Financial Times from Flybondi's 
quirky offices in downtown Buenos Aires, where the main corridor has a runway painted on the floor.
"It's your fault!" he exclaims, referring to an FT article describing some of the business-friendly policies Mr Macri put 
in place when he took power in December 2015. Mr Cook stands by the assessment he made back then that 
Argentina, as the eighth-largest country in the world, "was just crying out for a low-cost airline". But almost three 
years later, the scale of the challenges facing his new business are becoming ever more apparent.
Keeping staff on board for a disruptive ride The head of Flybondi , Argentina 's first budget airline, prioritises 
morale as he fights protectionism, writes Ben....
He says that in January this year he received a WhatsApp message from a local union leader trying to impose 
conditions. It read: "February is approaching and we still haven't made any progress on reaching an agreement. I 
remind you that without an agreement, you cannot fly."
Days later, Flybondi made its maiden flight regardless, and by October, although it had still not reached a deal with 
the unions, it had flown more than 600,000 passengers. It already has a market share of about 8 per cent, which Mr 
Cook expects to reach 10-12 per cent by the end of the year. Next month it will start its first international flights, 
from Buenos Aires to Paraguay and Uruguay.
At the heart of Mr Cook's strategy - and a key factor in the success of the carrier's launch - is his relationship with 
his employees.
"The key is continuing to build a strong culture in the company and that is what at the end of the day makes us 
succeed or not. People will turn to unions if they feel they are not being listened to by management, if they are 
unhappy. But if we continue to put an emphasis on people and they are happy working for Flybondi and feel they 
are making an impact on the country ... It's not like we have won and that's it, it's a continuous effort."
He endeavours to get to know all Flybondi's staff, to whom he writes a fortnightly email, and is in contact with the 
company's pilots via WhatsApp.
Rather than being "a CEO perched in an office in a tall building", Mr Cook flies with his airline at least once a week 
to meet airport staff and cabin crews.
"Maybe it sounds stupid, but one of our [core] values is happiness. If you look forward to going to work you provide 
a better service," he says.
He has, however, been unable to win over everyone living around the airport that Flybondi shares with Argentina's 
air force at El Palomar, in greater Buenos Aires. A group of locals secured a court injunction limiting the airline's 
flights to three a day, after complaining about the noise that the carrier's fleet would make - despite the airport being 
a military air base with much noisier aircraft.
"It was a complete disaster, a huge mess. We were taking a financial hit every day," says Mr Cook. Flights had to 
be cancelled or redirected. "It annoyed customers and was damaging to our reputation," he adds. Eventually, the 
courts lifted the restrictions.
This year's currency crisis in Argentina posed an even greater challenge. Mr Cook had been expecting the US 
dollar to be worth 21 pesos at the end of the year. In late September, it rose above 40.
"It is an extremely violent change in budget when 100 per cent of your income is in a currency that basically halved 
in value, with over 60 per cent of your costs in US dollars," he says. Trying to stay positive, he argues that the 
currency's fall means more Argentines are likely to take holidays at home, while inward international tourism could 
increase.
The government did heed Mr Cook's pleas for minimum fares to be scrapped, even if this put further pressure on 
the state airline Aerolíneas Argentinas. Minimum fares, together with maximum fares, were first implemented as an 
emergency measure after Argentina's 2001 economic crisis. "It's good news that you've got a president who 
understands that this is not to benefit us, but to give the freedom to fly to Argentines," says Mr Cook.
Unions for Aerolíneas Argentinas, long-distance buses and the political opponents of Mr Macri see things 
differently. Mr Cook says: "Anyone who comes to disrupt the status quo is not welcome. We are seeing [criticisms] 
here that you don't see anywhere else in the world."
He adds that as Flybondi is "very much associated" with the government: "To hit on Flybondi is a way for the 
opposition to hit on the government."

Among the criticisms levelled at Mr Cook was that he holds a British passport. The fact that his company was using 
a former military air base "from where thousands of Argentines left to defend their country against the English" in 
the 1982 Falklands war was "at the very least suggestive", wrote one local journalist.
Although he has both Swiss and UK citizenship, Mr Cook says that he usually describes himself as Swiss "for the 
sake of simplicity", having grown up in Switzerland, where his parents still live.
He ignored the bad press, believing that "people would eventually see through all this" - as was the case for 
Ryanair and EasyJet, which were also attacked when they led the rapid expansion of budget flights in Europe two 
decades ago.
And, as a board member pointed out, the criticism "was better than not being talked about at all".

Taking on one of the world's most aggressively protectionist business environments is not for the faint of heart. So 
far, airline industry veteran Julian Cook - who aspires to do in Argentina what Ryanair's Michael O'Leary achieved 
in Europe - has managed to stand his ground.
As chief executive and co-founder of Flybondi, Argentina's first low-cost domestic airline, Mr Cook runs one of the 
most high-profile, disruptive companies emboldened by the centre-right president Mauricio Macri's promise to open 
Argentina up to competition. He has, unsurprisingly, come under attack. Trade unions, the media and local 
communities have all put up resistance.
In spite of the threats, denigration and obstructions, the 45-year-old yoga enthusiast remains disarmingly serene. 
But he cannot resist taking a swipe at the Financial Times from Flybondi's quirky offices in downtown Buenos Aires, 
where the main corridor has a runway painted on the floor.
"It's your fault!" he exclaims, referring to an FT article describing some of the business-friendly policies Mr Macri put 
in place when he took power in December 2015. Mr Cook stands by the assessment he made back then that 
Argentina, as the eighth-largest country in the world, "was just crying out for a low-cost airline". But almost three 
years later, the scale of the challenges facing his new business are becoming ever more apparent.
Keeping staff on board for a disruptive ride The head of Flybondi , Argentina 's first budget airline, prioritises 
morale as he fights protectionism, writes Ben....
He says that in January this year he received a WhatsApp message from a local union leader trying to impose 
conditions. It read: "February is approaching and we still haven't made any progress on reaching an agreement. I 
remind you that without an agreement, you cannot fly."
Days later, Flybondi made its maiden flight regardless, and by October, although it had still not reached a deal with 
the unions, it had flown more than 600,000 passengers. It already has a market share of about 8 per cent, which Mr 
Cook expects to reach 10-12 per cent by the end of the year. Next month it will start its first international flights, 
from Buenos Aires to Paraguay and Uruguay.
At the heart of Mr Cook's strategy - and a key factor in the success of the carrier's launch - is his relationship with 
his employees.
"The key is continuing to build a strong culture in the company and that is what at the end of the day makes us 
succeed or not. People will turn to unions if they feel they are not being listened to by management, if they are 
unhappy. But if we continue to put an emphasis on people and they are happy working for Flybondi and feel they 
are making an impact on the country … It's not like we have won and that's it, it's a continuous effort."
He endeavours to get to know all Flybondi's staff, to whom he writes a fortnightly email, and is in contact with the 
company's pilots via WhatsApp.
Rather than being "a CEO perched in an office in a tall building", Mr Cook flies with his airline at least once a week 
to meet airport staff and cabin crews.
"Maybe it sounds stupid, but one of our [core] values is happiness. If you look forward to going to work you provide 
a better service," he says.
He has, however, been unable to win over everyone living around the airport that Flybondi shares with Argentina's 
air force at El Palomar, in greater Buenos Aires. A group of locals secured a court injunction limiting the airline's 
flights to three a day, after complaining about the noise that the carrier's fleet would make - despite the airport being 
a military air base with much noisier aircraft.
"It was a complete disaster, a huge mess. We were taking a financial hit every day," says Mr Cook. Flights had to 
be cancelled or redirected. "It annoyed customers and was damaging to our reputation," he adds. Eventually, the 
courts lifted the restrictions.
This year's currency crisis in Argentina posed an even greater challenge. Mr Cook had been expecting the US 
dollar to be worth 21 pesos at the end of the year. In late September, it rose above 40.
"It is an extremely violent change in budget when 100 per cent of your income is in a currency that basically halved 
in value, with over 60 per cent of your costs in US dollars," he says. Trying to stay positive, he argues that the 
currency's fall means more Argentines are likely to take holidays at home, while inward international tourism could 
increase.
The government did heed Mr Cook's pleas for minimum fares to be scrapped, even if this put further pressure on 
the state airline Aerolíneas Argentinas. Minimum fares, together with maximum fares, were first implemented as an 
emergency measure after Argentina's 2001 economic crisis. "It's good news that you've got a president who

Supersonic flight: will it ever rise out of the ashes of Concorde?

You could tell without looking up that Concorde was on its final approach to Heathrow: its Rolls Royce Olympus 
turbojets made the same roar on landing as others did taking off. It was a treat just to watch it in flight, and many of 
us assumed one day that supersonic flight would be the norm, not a novelty.
Concorde's crash just outside Paris on 25 July, 2000 was actually just the symbolic end for the world's only 
supersonic airliner. It may have been ahead of its time, but paradoxically it was already out of date and out of touch. 
Weighed down with political and economic baggage, Concorde was grounded in 2003, which seemed to signify the 
end of commercial supersonic travel (SST).
Maybe Concorde had made us complacent. Just as the Apollo generation assumed we'd have moon bases by now, 
having SST since the 1960s meant we thought everything could only get sleeker and quicker. Instead, we got 
bigger and cheaper. Instead of ramjets, we got Ryanair.
With a cruising altitude of 19,812 metres (65,000 feet) - nearly twice the height of other airliners - and a speed of 
1345.6mph (more than twice the speed of sound) Concorde flew 100 souls higher and faster than modern fighter 
jets, making the journey from London to New York in just three and a half hours. That this herculean Anglo-French 
collaboration - between the French state-owned aerospace manufacturer Aerospatiale and its British counterpart 
BACB - got airborne amid such stern competition from the US and Russia in a cold-war-driven age of one-
upmanship is a marvel.
The short lived Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 launched in December 1968, stealing Concorde's thunder by just two 
months. It was so similar the Anglo-French team suspected espionage. But the sleek exterior concealed a flight 
deck stuffed with archaic levers and instrumentation. Clearly an exercise in propaganda, the Tu-144 had no 
practical use: the communist USSR did not tolerate Concorde's jetset customer base and it had nowhere to fly to. 
So it became a supersonic workhorse, ferrying mail across the USSR. A fatal crash at the 1973 Paris Air 
Show ended Russia's supersonic passenger effort.
Boeing's 2707 was the USA's attempt, a supersonic behemoth designed to fly some 300 people at mach 3 (over 
2,300mph). By flying faster it could make more trips, its designers reckoned, and it would pay off. But, like a later 
1990 NASA-led project, the High Speed Civil Transport, it never left the drawing board. Huge technological, 
environmental and economic hurdles meant that no one - Boeing especially - wanted to build it and, crucially, no 
one wanted to buy it.
Supersonic flight: will it ever rise out of the ashes of Concorde?
Those hurdles are partly why we aren't blasting supersonically to Sydney and back in time for tea today. Peculiar 
things happen when you hit the speed of sound. Sound waves and air compress at the nose, creating an 
aerodynamic barrier that increases wave drag fourfold, and needs a lot of power (and fuel) just to penetrate. And 
when it does, the shockwave begets the infamous sonic boom.
Scientists had known about this since at least 1964, with the notorious Operation Bongo II experiments, in which 
the US air force conducted a series of supersonic test flights 65,000ft over Oklahoma City, to determine whether the 
sonic boom would still be audible at ground level. Following 10,000 complaints of broken windows and shattered 
plaster, nearly every state banned supersonic flights in their airspace, scuppering dreams of an east-west 
supersonic shuttle. To this day, supersonic flight is banned over land in the US and Europe, and it was years before 
the US supreme court would even allow Concorde to come in over the Atlantic.
There are other flies in the supersonic ointment. Flying this fast superheats the aircraft, so it must be made of 
special - and expensive - composites such as titanium alloys, or carbide ceramic materials that can withstand 
temperatures of 3,000C. The faster you go, lift and drag increases, requiring aerodynamic wings, a thinner 
fuselage, and a much higher cruising height where the air is thin. But the higher you fly the bigger the engines 
needed to cram in enough air. This means you need a lot of fuel, which ultimately, results in poor range. Even 
Concorde was only just capable of the transatlantic trip, and it showed SSTs weren't worth flying on routes shorter 
than three hours, which cut out a lot of routes.
So how did Concorde have the freedom of the skies for 27 years? It helped that British Airways put up with it as a 
flagship loss-leader until 1980, when two of its pilots took over Concorde and hiked the price to about £8,000 a 
ticket - to any normal customer base this might have been a suicidal move, but to a luxury market not exactly 
counting the pennies, the rise didn't seem to matter. Suddenly, Concorde was "reassuringly expensive''. Over its 
lifetime, it made BA profits of about £750m.
But the French did not follow suit and was going bust. Eventually they grounded their Concorde, and when legacy 
firm Airbus announced it was to stop making and servicing the parts, it was the beginning of the end for the British 
plane too.
Air travel had already moved on. The concept of "luxury" travel now meant reclining seats, space and comfort, and 
suddenly Concorde's narrow fuselage looked cramped. Recliners and TVs? Forget it. Concorde was an outdated 
notion of prestige that left sheer speed the only luxury of supersonic travel.
Air travel was becoming democratised, something Boeing spotted as early as the 1960s. The future was bigger, not 
faster, resulting in the Boeing 747. Fifty years later a jumbo can still carry more than three times as many 
passengers, with the same fuel, as Concorde, and at a fraction of the price. In the tortoise and hare air travel race, 
the tortoise is winning.
But the race isn't over. New technology has opened up exciting possibilities.
Lockheed Martin and Aerion have developed a concept aircraft that can fly at Mach 1.2 with no sonic boom - 
technology they've tested on an F15 fighter jet. The drawback: it can only work on small aircraft, which means 
Aerion will be a business jet.
Not to be discouraged, last year NASA unveiled its new quiet supersonic prototype, called QueSST, which it says is 
1,000 times quieter than Concorde (opening up routes over land) and it may be ready to test-fly in 2019.
But perhaps the most exciting development is the 55-seater airliner being developed by Virgin and Denver 
outfit Boom. Its XB-1 two-seater prototype will be tested in late 2018 and should be capable of Mach 2.2, with the 
eventual airliner forecast to be able to fly customers for the same price as any other business-class seat. It is a 
tribute to Concorde that it looks similar to the old bird. But new materials and tech allow it to fly faster, further, 
quieter (and more cheaply) than Concorde.
Supersonic flight: will it ever rise out of the ashes of Concorde?
Japan Airlines has already pre-ordered 20 of the aircraft. Which means supersonic aircraft may once again soon be 
a reality - at least for a select few of us. Now, where have we heard that before?

Ryanair pilots angered by recruitment for UK arm Airlines

Ryanair has further angered some of its pilots by starting to recruit for a UK unit to protect against a no-deal Brexit.
Pilots say the salaries offered at the subsidiary undermine Ryanair's claims about how much they earn, which the 
airline insists would not be lower than the parent group and can be up to (EURO)200,000 (£178,000).
Captains will receive basic pay of £105,000 and first officers £55,000 as part of a "small number" of secondments to 
Ryanair UK from January.
"There will be a lot of unhappy guys.
Pay is well below what Ryanair keep banging on about [(EURO)200,000]," one pilot said.
Ryanair says on its corporate recruitment website that it offers "industry leading pay of up to (EURO)200,000 [a 
year] as captain" and reiterated that figure in response to a Financial Times question.
Brian Strutton, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots' Association, said: "It is unclear why Ryanair thinks it 
needs to second existing UK pilots into its new UK [subsidiary]. This is potentially confusing, inflexible and 
bureaucratic."
In an email to all pilots, Peter Bellew chief operating officer, invited applications for a 12-month secondment to 
Ryanair UK. "As part of our preparations for Brexit, we are establishing a UK airline to safeguard our flying rights in 
the UK," he wrote.
Ryanair pilots angered by recruitment for UK arm Airlines
"The process of applying to the UK Civil Aviation Authority is under way," said Ryanair, which has 3,000 pilots at 14 
UK bases.
The carrier said that it would work with Balpa and "we do not foresee any difficulty with extending terms of Ryanair's 
recognition agreement to Ryanair UK".
Ryanair UK is applying for an operating licence from the UK regulator for the subsidiary, which has been created for 
flights within Britain should the country leave the EU without an agreement.
The company is determined that the parent company should remain EUowned and controlled, which will enable it to 
continue to fly in the bloc.
The subsidiary will have one aeroplane to start with, based at Stansted airport in Essex, but the airline said that it 
expected to increase aircraft numbers in the coming seasons.

Ryanair unit Laudamotion has taken delivery of the first two Airbus A320s being leased from SMBC Aviation 
Capital.
The aircraft, MSNs 2924 and 2928, are the first aircraft delivered on lease to the Austrian carrier since Ryanair 
increased its stake in the operator to a majority share earlier this year.
Source: SMBC Aviation Capital
The first aircraft has just been delivered to Laudamotion, while the second will follow in January once cabin 
reconfiguration has been completed. Flight Fleets Analyzer shows the two aircraft are 2006-build models.
Laudamotion managing director Andreas Gruber says: “We are pleased to conclude this deal with SMBC Aviation 
Capital for these two Airbus aircraft following the acquisition of 75% in Laudamotion by Ryanair. This is an exciting 
time for the airline as it enhances its fleet.”
A consortium led by Niki Lauda acquired assets of Austrian carrier Niki - the leisure carrier Lauda had founded - 
from administrators earlier this year. It launched flights earlier this summer on former Niki routes using Airbus 
narrowbodies. Ryanair, an all-Boeing 737 operator, quickly took a stake in the carrier ahead of acquiring a majority 
holding and it now flies as a Ryanair subsidiary.
SMBC Aviation Capital chief executive Peter Barrett says: "In 2003, we leased one of our first Boeing aircraft to 
Ryanair. We are delighted now to conclude this transaction with the airline for its first Airbus aircraft which will be 
incorporated into the Laudamotion fleet. ."

 easyJet rewarded investors with a big dividend hike on Tuesday, after reporting a sharp rise in annual earnings.
The discount airline expressed confidence that its strategy and positioning will deliver substantial value for 
shareholders as it reported a rise in annual earnings.
For the financial year ended September 30, pretax profit surged more than 40% to GBP578 million from GBP405 
million the year before and revenue rose 17% to GBP5.90 billion from GBP5.05 billion last year. In addition, 
passengers numbers were up 10% to 88.5 million from 80.2 million, while the load factor rose to 92.9% from 92.6%.
The company lifted its total dividend 43% to 58.6 pence from 40.9p last year.
"Our strategy continues to ensure we are well positioned for the future. We have made considerable progress on 
our new initiatives in holidays, business and loyalty, which will enable us to grow profitably. While disruption 
continues to be a major challenge for the industry, we are investing in resilience to help to mitigate the impact on 
our customers," said Chief Executive Johan Lundgren.
Having a less good start to the week was fellow budget airling Ryanair Holding.
Furious passengers blasted the carrier for slapping them with GBP55 fees for not being able to check-in online after 
its website crashed.
Jetsetters took to social media to vent their anger with the budget airline on Monday night when they could not 
access its website for hours.
Some were left fuming when they could not book flights, but others barraged the airline with complaints that they 
had been handed late fees for not checking-in in advance.

API weekly Statistical Bulletin----------Theresa May's DUP allies have delivered a warning shot across the bows 
after accusing the UK prime minister of breaking fundamental promises on Brexit. The party joined with Labour to 
cut the government's majority to just five in a Commons vote on the Budget. They also abstained on a series of 
other amendments to the Finance Bill on Monday night in a move intended to send a "political message" to May. 
Their actions appeared to call into question the future of the "confidence and supply" arrangement by which the 
DUP props up May's minority Conservative Government. Under the terms of the deal, agreed after May lost her 
Commons majority in last year's general election, the Northern Ireland party is supposed to back the government on 
Budget matters and on confidence votes. But DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said May's deal with Brussels 
breached a "fundamental" assurance that Northern Ireland would not be separated constitutionally or economically 
from the rest of the UK.----------Negotiators from EU member states failed to reach an agreement over the 2019 
eurozone budget by the deadline of midnight on Monday, ensuring that further discussions will have to be 
scheduled in coming weeks. The budget covers everything from agricultural subsidies and support for poorer 
regions to research and education programmes. Most money flows back to member states. The European 
Commission is now required to submit a fresh proposal for talks later this month or early in December, according to 
a spokesperson for the Austrian government, which holds the rotating EU presidency through December.----------
Three US senators challenged the appointment of Matthew Whitaker to the job of acting attorney general in a 
lawsuit that claims the appointment is unconstitutional. The senators say the appointment violates the US 
Constitution's clause on the appointment process, specifically the requirement that the US Senate provide "advice 
and consent" on presidential appointments for principal federal offices. In their 17-page complaint filed in US District 
Court in Washington they say he cannot be appointed because the US Senate did not confirm him to his prior post. 
Whitaker was chief of staff under former attorney general Jeff Sessions.----------BROKER RATING CHANGES--------

COMPANIES - FTSE 100----------Catering firm Compass Group said it had a strong year with healthy revenue 
growth, driven by an excellent performance in North America, an acceleration in Europe and good progress in Rest 
of World. For the financial year ended September 30, revenue increased 1.7% to GBP22.96 billion from GBP22.57 
billion last year and operating profit rose to GBP1.69 billion from GBP1.67 billion. On an underlying basis, revenue 
rose 5.5% to GBP23.24 billion from GBP21.84 billion last year and operating profit was up 7.1% to GBP1.74 billion 
from GBP1.63 billion. The company-supplied consensus also had expected underlying profit of GBP1.74 billion. 
The company's underlying operating margin remained flat at 7.4%. Compass noted statutory basis earnings were 
lower than underlying results mainly due to the adverse foreign exchange movements during the year. Compass 
reported that annual underlying organic revenue growth was 5.5%, accelerating from 4.0% last year. This beat the 
company-supplied consensus estimate of 5.3%. The company raised its annual dividend 13% to 37.7p from 33.5p 
last year.----------De Beers reported a fall in ninth cycle diamond sales, but the figure met expectations nonetheless. 
De Beers, a subsidiary of London and Johannesburg-listed Anglo American, said cycle nine diamond sales were 
USD440 million, down 5.6% from USD466 million year-on-year. The figure is likewise a drop on the eighth cycle, 
which reported sales of USD482 million.----------Miner BHP Group confirmed it changed its name from BHP Billiton 
on Monday following shareholder approval. The vote was carried out in September. BHP's ticker in both 
Johannesburg and London will change to 'BHP' from 'BLT', while its ISIN number also will change. ----------
COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL----------Shares in Apple fell 4.0% after the Wall Street Journal said the company 
LONDON BRIEFING: easyJet Pays Out As Ryanair Takes Heat
slashed production orders for all three of the iPhone models that were unveiled in September.----------Shares in 
Nissan Motor dropped on the Tokyo Stock Exchange following the overnight arrest of chairman Carlos Ghosn for 
alleged financial misconduct. Nissan shares were down 5.5%, while Mitsubishi Motors, where Ghosn also serves as 
chairman, plunged 6.9%. The broader Nikkei 225 stock average was down 1.1%. Tokyo prosecutors arrested the 
64-year-old on suspicion of understating his salary in Japan by JPY5 billion over five years from 2011, Japanese 
media reported, citing investigative sources. Nissan President Hiroto Saikawa told a news conference on Monday 
night that the carmaker would seek to remove Ghosn at a board meeting Thursday. Japan's second-largest 
carmaker said Monday that an internal investigation found that Ghosn, who also chairs Renault SA, had under-
reported his income for years. The company added that it was cooperating with prosecutors.----------French bank 
Societe Generale has agreed to pay some USD1.34 billion in fines for "unsafe and unsound practices" regarding 
violations of sanctions on Cuba, the US Federal Reserve said. The Federal Reserve said it "fined Societe Generale 
for having insufficient policies and procedures to ensure that the activities conducted at its offices outside of the US 
complied with US sanctions laws". The measures against the bank were largely expected. The bank said in 
September that it was in intense dialogue with US officials. The fine comes on top of other scandals involving the 
bank, including the fixing of the Libor rate, the interest-rate benchmark. The bank also settled a probe into its 
dealings in Libya.----------Boeing Co and Jeju Air announced the airline ordered 40 737 MAX 8 airplanes with 
options for 10 additional jets. The deal, valued at up to USD5.9 billion at list prices, is the largest order ever placed 
by a Korean low-cost carrier, Boeing said. Jeju Air, based in South Korea's Jeju Island, began operation in 2005 as 
the country's first low-cost carrier.----------Tuesday's Shareholder Meetings

Easyjet profits to take off, but rising fuel costs could hit growth outlook
Easyjet profits to take off, but rising fuel costs could hit growth outlook

EASYJET is set to report soaring profits for the year after capitalising on the collapse of rivals Monarch and Air 
Berlin.
The low-cost airline is expected to report pre-tax profit of £570m to £580m, towards the top of its guidance and up 
from £385m the previous year, and £5.9bn revenue.
The carrier has taken advantage of the collapse of rivals Air Berlin and Monarch in October last year.
But shares in Europe's secondlargest airline, behind Ryanair, have dropped more than a third since June on higher 
fuel costs and Brexit uncertainty.
Analysts said investors should be looking out for other signs of growth when its full-year results are published 
tomorrow.
"A lot of Easyjet's tailwinds have come from forces outside its control, like the collapse of rival Monarch and 
reduced fuel costs," George Salmon, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said. "We would like to see a downturn in 
costs per seat.
"Easyjet's non-fuel costs are rising, and if tailwinds run out of puff that can quickly become a problem."

Stocks exposed to the UK economy tumbled yesterday as parliamentary resignations over Prime Minister Theresa 
May's draft EU withdrawal agreement threw the Brexit process into chaos.
Royal Bank of Scotland was hit by its biggest fall in more than two years, losing nearly 10 per cent on fears of 
slower economic growth, rising defaults, business disruption and the tail risk of a break-up under a Labour 
government.
A plunge for the pound helped support the multinational-heavy FTSE 100 index but sectors reliant on domestic 
earnings and those exposed to political risks were hit hard.
Indices tracking UK electricity companies, transport operators and retailers all fell more than 4 per cent while those 
tracking banking, telecoms and life insurance slipped about 3 per cent.
"UK earnings recovery is in full swing for UK plc," said Citigroup analyst Jonathan Stubbs. "This likely continues 
barring a hard landing in the UK or the end of the global cycle. Brexit-related risks could end this earnings 
recovery."
The FTSE 100, which takes an estimated three-quarters of revenue from outside the UK, ended the day little 
changed as investors switched into dollar and euro earners such as Unilever, Randgold Resources and Smirnoff 
owner Diageo. When priced in dollars, the UK blue-chip benchmark was down 1.4 per cent.

But fears about UK consumer sentiment hit housebuilders and leisure stocks, sending the mid-cap FTSE 250 lower 
as much as 2 per cent. Countryside Properties, buy-to-let lender One-Savings Bank and travel agent Thomas Cook 
were all under pressure. Bovis Homes fell even after the housebuilder said it had met sales targets for 2018 and 
would match full-year profit expectations. Bovis was down 7.2 per cent, Countryside and OneSavings dropped more 
than 9 per cent and Thomas Cook was 4.3 per cent lower.
EasyJet and Ryanair weakened about 7 per cent on concern that flights might be grounded by a no-deal split from 
the EU. Domestic airline Flybe, which earlier this week put itself up for sale, dropped 16 per cent.
"The risks of a disorderly outcome are significantly underpriced by the market," said Deutsche Bank strategist Oliver 
Harvey. Financial stocks including Lloyds priced in the likelihood of a more gradual path for interest rate rises 
eroding their net interest margins.
Speculation of a snap general election also weighed on regulated utilities and government outsourcers such as 
Capita, which dropped nearly 15 per cent.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to take privatised companies back into public ownership and has 
threatened to cancel state contracts awarded to "rogue suppliers". See Lex

Tourism revenues in Jordan reach $4.5 billion in 10 months; Low cost flights

(ANSA) - NOVEMBER 14 -  Recovery of tourism sector in Jordan  appears well on track after revenues jumped to 
$4.5 billion, or 12.6 percent growth, during the first 10 months of 2018, central bank figures showed today. The 
numbers represent a leap in the volume of tourism performance in a country that has seen its economy heavily hit 
as a result of uncertainty in the region, according to officials.  Officials from tourism authorities told ANSA that the 
rock engraved city of Petra is seeing the highest number of visitors in years, as hotels run in full capacity while 
cruise ships docking in the port city of Aqaba are lining up with thousands of visitors on weekly basis. 
The government and tourism operators expect yet another increase in number of tourists during the coming period 
after the start of low cost flights to the kingdom from Europe such as Easy jet and Ryanair.  Officials from Jordan 
Tourism Board (JTB) said an aggressive promotion campaign, locally and internationally, played a significant role in 
attracting tourists to the kingdom. According to JTB,  the government has also supported plans to stimulate the 
charter and low-cost flights, allowing for the number of tourists to rise compared to the previous years. Tourism 
sector is considered the second main sources of foreign currency in a country that has no natural resources as its 
economy relies on services, remittances from expatriates in the gulf as well as foreign aid. The Arab spring dealt a 
heavy blow to tourism sector, forcing many companies and operators to shut down or scale down their operation, 
but officials from JTB hope the worst is gone after Syria war has eased up during the past months, coupled with 
reconciliation efforts in the war torn country.

Investors are stepping up pressure on IAG, Ryanair and easyJet to explain how the airlines are preparing their 
businesses for a no-deal Brexit as fears rise that their aircraft will be grounded.
Shareholders have asked for meetings with airline bosses and board members as the Brexit deadline looms.
There are also growing concerns that UK-based investors might be forced to dump shares in the event of a no-deal 
Brexit or lose voting rights.
One big UK-based investor said: "We are due to see easyJet shortly, and will be pressing for more detail. It affects 
them as much as everyone else.
"They [the airlines] are putting contingency plans in place. It is going to be a major problem if they can't take off or 
land."
Another of the UK's biggest investors said portfolio managers at the asset manager had been pressing for more 
details on how the airlines would cope with a no-deal Brexit.
"It is not a simple question, and you can bet your bottom dollar the answer will be even more complex," he said.

easyJet face demand for fuller explanation on con....
"They are running the business, they are closer to the policymakers. If we got the answer that they weren't worried 
about it, it would raise a warning flag."
The European Commission is planning to give airlines no extra time to meet the EU's ownership requirements, 
according to Brussels' draft contingency plans. Under existing rules, airlines must prove they are 50 per cent EU 
owned and controlled to qualify for operating licences.
Ryanair and easyJet have tried to respond to the problem by preparing plans to take away voting rights of their non-
EU shareholders to ensure that they reach the 51 per cent threshold.
However, these moves would not go down well with shareholders as they would lose their say on issues from pay 
to the chairman's role.
Paul Lee, a corporate governance expert, said it would be a "terrible result" for UK-based investors if they were to 
lose their right to vote at airlines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
"If you have shares that don't have voting rights, they are not shares. They are a warrant," he said.
With little time left ahead of Britain's scheduled March 29 exit, IAG remains the most reluctant to provide detailed 
assurances to investors about how it would address a no deal, declining to give guidance about whether, if forced, 
over the long term it would opt to be a British company or an EU one.
A report in Spanish newspaper El País over the weekend said that IAG had made it clear to authorities in Madrid 
that it would remain European.
Brexit throws up particular problems for IAG, as it owns British Airways but also EU-based airlines.
The problems have been compounded by the likelihood that a post-Brexit US-UK aviation agreement will be 
expected to require the Spanish-registered company to be majority-owned by UK parties.
"For traffic rights purposes, [IAG] needs to argue that BA is British to one side of the world, and to the other they 
need to argue that [IAG's other subsidiaries] Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus are solidly European," said Andrew 
Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC.
He said supposing such an outcome could be sustainable after Brexit required "a suspension of disbelief".
To date, IAG has done little more than mention that it has "contingency plans" for Brexit; the response on the issue 
from Antonio Vázquez Romero, IAG chairman. Elsewhere, long-haul lowcost carrier Norwegian has a UK subsidiary 
in the same position as BA regarding the US, as does Virgin Atlantic. Sir Richard Branson owns 51 per cent of 
Virgin, making it majority-UKowned. But he is in the process of selling 31 per cent to Air France-KLM, which could 
complicate Virgin's access rights to the US. US airline Delta owns the remaining stake. In the event of a nodeal 
Brexit, Air France-KLM and Delta have agreed a deal to keep Virgin as the majority shareholder, protecting its US 
flight rights.
Norwegian said: "Structurally, Norwegian is well-positioned to protect our flying rights both in Europe and the UK, 
including in the unlikely event of a nodeal Brexit." Norwegian would use its main airline to keep flying around 
Europe and its UK one to fly to the US, if a UK-US agreement is reached.
In the case of IAG, if there is a no-deal Brexit, it would need to disfranchise non-EU shareholders, taking away 
voting rights, though this might leave BA in an awkward position on its profitable US flights. But even if everything 
went as smoothly as IAG is hoping for, there is no assurance it could maintain its corporate equilibrium indefinitely. 
HSBC's Mr Lobbenberg said: "The requirement that European airlines be controlled and owned by EU citizens is 
there in black and white." Additional reporting by Alex Barker in Brussels

Investors are stepping up pressure on IAG, Ryanair and easyJet to explain how the airlines are preparing their 
businesses for a no-deal Brexit as fears rise that their aircraft will be grounded.
Shareholders have asked for meetings with airline bosses and board members as the Brexit deadline looms.
There are also growing concerns that UK-based investors might be forced to dump shares in the event of a no-deal 
Brexit or lose voting rights.
One big UK-based investor said: "We are due to see easyJet shortly, and will be pressing for more detail. It affects 
them as much as everyone else.
"They [the airlines] are putting contingency plans in place. It is going to be a major problem if they can't take off or 
land."
Another of the UK's biggest investors said portfolio managers at the asset manager had been pressing for more 
details on how the airlines would cope with a no-deal Brexit.
"It is not a simple question, and you can bet your bottom dollar the answer will be even more complex," he said.

"They are running the business, they are closer to the policymakers. If we got the answer that they weren't worried 
about it, it would raise a warning flag."
The European Commission is planning to give airlines no extra time to meet the EU's ownership requirements, 
according to Brussels' draft contingency plans. Under existing rules, airlines must prove they are 50 per cent EU 
owned and controlled to qualify for operating licences.
Ryanair and easyJet have tried to respond to the problem by preparing plans to take away voting rights of their non-
EU shareholders to ensure that they reach the 51 per cent threshold.
However, these moves would not go down well with shareholders as they would lose their say on issues from pay 
to the chairman's role.
Paul Lee, a corporate governance expert, said it would be a "terrible result" for UK-based investors if they were to 
lose their right to vote at airlines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
"If you have shares that don't have voting rights, they are not shares. They are a warrant," he said.
With little time left ahead of Britain's scheduled March 29 exit, IAG remains the most reluctant to provide detailed 
assurances to investors about how it would address a no deal, declining to give guidance about whether, if forced, 
over the long term it would opt to be a British company or an EU one.

There was a particular irony in the recent profit warning from the JD Wetherspoon pub chain, which said it was 
having to increase wages in the face of a tight labour market. Tim Martin, the Wetherspoons chairman, was a 
prominent supporter of Britain's exit from the EU - which is set to make the labour market even tighter.
Mr Martin suggested Wetherspoons would not be further squeezed by Brexit as many of its pubs were in 
lowimmigration towns or rural areas and 90 per cent of its workers were Britishborn. But across the economy, 
competition will only intensify as the government prepares to curb immigration in response to what it sees as one of 
the driving forces behind the Leave victory in the 2016 referendum.
The UK is already at its closest to full employment since the early 1970s, with a 4 per cent jobless rate. Companies 
such as Royal Mail and Ryanair have also warned of wage pressures. A Financial Times report, meanwhile, found 
the hospitality, IT, construction, healthcare and leisure-related services sectors were suffering acute shortages of 
skilled or unskilled workers.
In some ways, rising wages are welcome, after pay increases lagged even the insipid recovery of recent years. 
Real incomes have still to regain their level before the financial crisis of a decade ago. But the tight labour market 
has important implications.
The IT, healthcare and construction sectors are all confronting a shortage of necessary skills. For hospitality and 
industries such as hairdressers and beauticians, where half of staff tend to be under 30, the challenge is different. 
UK skills squeeze poses another Brexit dilemma Government must balance immigration curbs with companies' 
needs
Thanks to a dip in the birth rate around the millennium, one senior hospitality sector representative says the issue is 
simply a "shortage of bodies available". The meat processing industry, with 60 per cent of its staff coming from 
continental Europe, has raised alarms too. By unleashing some pent-up corporate investment, a benign Brexit 
under an agreed deal - though that scenario seems ever more in question - might increase UK economic output by 
1 per cent above current forecasts over, say, three years. But with such meagre growth in productivity over the past 
decade, higher wages are likely to be passed on quickly to consumers, resulting in inflationary pressures. Interest 
rate rises from the Bank of England would then be likely to snuff out much of this growth. A tighter jobs market 
makes growth even more likely to be inflationary.
The government needs, therefore, to strike a careful balance between the urge to staunch immigration, and 
businesses' need for staff. Its Migration Advisory Committee recommended scrapping a 20,700-a-year cap on "Tier 
2" visas for high-skilled workers, to ensure companies can attract talent. But it suggested limiting low-skilled 
migration, except in agriculture.
The Home Office, due to publish an immigration white paper in coming weeks, has indicated it might reject some 
MAC recommendations. It should consider sector-specific visa schemes allowing critical industries such as food 
processing to bring in non-UK workers for a defined period.
Over the longer term, the answer must be, in part, investment in education and re-training to match the needs of 
British employers. Even if it can navigate its way successfully through Brexit, however, the government will face a 
continuing dilemma. The 2016 vote put it under pressure to close doors to migrants. Yet even a modest Brexit 
dividend - one that recouped some of the growth lost since the referendum - could be partially dissipated if there are 
not enough workers to deliver it.

Former boss to take on Stobart in court battle
Former boss to take on Stobart in court battle

THE BITTER boardroom battle between Stobart and a former company boss will come to a head this morning as 
the trial into the dismissal of Andrew Tinkler gets under way.
The Southend Airport owner claims Tinkler led an unlawful conspiracy against the company with an unsuccessful 
attempt to topple chairman Iain Ferguson in July.
Tinkler supported Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day for the role, but he was narrowly defeated in a 
shareholders' vote.
But Tinkler, who was chief executive for a decade, has lodged a counterclaim that his dismissal was invalid. 
Tinkler's lawyers amended their argument at a pre-trial hearing last month to include claims that the "difficult 
questions" he asked regarding Stobart's deal with Ryanair partly led to his dismissal.
At the annual meeting just days before his dismissal, he suggested the company''s $300m (£225m) deal, which will 
see three Ryanair aircraft based at the airport from next summer, would negatively impact its finances.
Tinkler's legal team will also argue that the chairman vote was swayed after chief executive Warwick Brady and 
Ferguson decided over Whatsapp to transfer 6m treasury shares to Employment Benefit Trust shares and use them 
to vote for Ferguson.
Stobart will claim Tinkler had made decisions regarding the failed takeover of Flybe to "enrich himself".
The firm will also claim he conspired with shareholders to elect billionaire entrepreneur Philip Day as chairman, 
creating a cabal which misused confidential information and "destabilised" the company.
Former boss to take on Stobart in court battle
In a separate matter, Stobart will claim Tinkler further breached his fiduciary duties through "excessive and 
unnecessary" expenses.
At a pre-trial hearing last month the court heard Tinkler's daughter had been using a company flat in Soho Square 
and Range Rover acquired at a charity event and that he had used Stobart funds for his helicopter and jet travel. 
Tinkler denies the allegations.

France seizes jet at takeoff after Ryanair doesn't pay bill
France seizes jet at takeoff after Ryanair doesn't pay bill

Dateline: PARIS 
Body
PARIS (AP) - Storms, strikes, computer failures - you can now add "your plane has been seized by the 
government" to the list of things that can delay your flight.
In France, 149 passengers were preparing to take off for London late Thursday when French authorities ordered 
their Ryanair Boeing 737 impounded.
The budget carrier owed money and it was "regrettable that the state was forced" to evacuate the plane, the civil 
aviation authority said.
The passengers had gone through passport control and security and were about to walk on the tarmac to board the 
plane when airport authorities told them to turn around, passenger Boris Hejblum said.
"The airport staff told us there was an issue with the plane," he told The Associated Press in an email.
No Ryanair staff members were available, and the only communication from the airline was two text messages 
saying simply that the departure was delayed, and a 5-euro ($5.75) voucher for food - "less than what a sandwich 
cost at the airport café," the 30-year-old Frenchman said.
"I found it strange that the police were the only ones giving us information," he said.
The passengers were put on another flight that finally brought them to London's Stansted airport - five hours late.
The multi-million dollar jet, meanwhile, was released only Friday after Ryanair paid a bill of 525,000 euros 
($610,000).
The scene unfolded at the Bordeaux-Merignac airport in western France, where authorities say the airline was 
ordered to pay back funds that the European Union had declared to be illegal subsidies. Ryanair did not publicly 
comment on the seizure.
France seizes jet at takeoff after Ryanair doesn't pay bill
French aviation agency spokesman Eric Heraud said regional authorities who originally gave the subsidies had 
been trying since 2014 to recover the money, and sent its final legal warning in May. After six months without a 
response from Ryanair, it decided to act Friday.
The standoff with French authorities will not help Ryanair, which more than most carriers, has come to symbolize 
budget airlines' relentless focus on the bottom line at the cost of customer service.
Ryanair has become Europe's largest airline by number of passengers by persistently offering some of the 
cheapest fares available. That ensures its planes are packed.
It then makes extra money with add-on fares. Besides charging for seating choice and food - now standard practice 
on budget flights the world over - it also has travelers pay for any carry-on bag that's larger than a purse.
It manages to keep its costs down by flying to out of the way airports at odd hours to get cheaper airport slots.
Its CEO, Michael O'Leary, personifies the airline's brash approach, sparring with unions and EU authorities. And 
despite conceding in 2013 that "we should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off," the airline 
retains its reputation as something to be endured for the sake of flying cheaply around Europe.
"I would say we just took it as another Ryanair problem, having no information from them," Hejblum said of 
Thursday's incident. "When we found out about the seizure, I would say the general sentiment was to blame 
Ryanair for not complying with the law."

Ryanair faced yet more woe as the lowcost airline was forced to pay (EURO)525,000 to France yesterday to secure 
the return of a jet impounded at Bordeaux airport.
The Irish company, which has faced months of bad publicity over flight disruptions and strikes, made the payment 
after almost 150 passengers were taken off a London-bound plane by the French Civil Aviation Authority.
France said the jet was seized as a "last resort" in a dispute over the repayment of regional funding for flights at the 
Angoulême airport that were later deemed illegal by Brussels.
The Associated Press cited Eric Heraud, spokesman for the French Civil Aviation Authority, saying the plane would 
be released after Ryanair paid back the funds.
The European Commission's ruling was one of seven findings of illegal state aid between 2014 and 2016 against 
Ryanair's arrangements at regional airports that included Nîmes, Altenburg, Zweibrücken, Cagliari and Klagenfurt. 
The airline appealed in the European courts when it was ordered to repay some (EURO)23.7m of alleged aid after it 
was ruled to have gained an unfair economic advantage.

subsidies deemed illegal by Brussels
The French authority said: "It is unfortunate that the state had to take such action, which led to the inevitable 
inconvenience of the 149 passengers on board the immobilised plane." It added: "Those passengers were able to 
eventually reach their destination later that evening on another Ryanair plane, but with a five-hour delay."
Ryanair did not respond to a request for comments.
The company faces more pressure from competition regulators. In October the European Commission opened an 
inquiry into whether Ryanair benefited from illegal state aid at Germany's Frankfurt-Hahn airport.
In recent days Italy's antitrust agency opened a probe against Ryanair's new hand luggage policies.
The dispute over the grounded jet comes during a period of turbulence at the airline that kicked off last year when a 
rostering "mess-up" led to thousands of flights being cancelled.
This week the company sacked six cabin crew who were pictured sleeping on the floor of a Spanish airport office. 
Ryanair said the image, widely shared online, was staged.
The development came as Ryanair and Michael O'Leary, its longtime chief executive, were sued in New York by a 
shareholder claiming the airline defrauded investors and inflated its share price by overstating its ability to manage 
labour relations and keep costs down. Ryanair said such claims were "false" and "doomed to fail".
In addition, lawyers representing an elderly woman racially abused on a flight have demanded compensation and 
asked the airline for a "proper" apology. There was outrage last month when a passenger was filmed hurling verbal 
abuse at the woman.

Ryanair pays up after France impounds plane just before takeoff

Budget airline Ryanair paid French authorities 525,000 euros (596,000 dollars) Friday to release a plane seized at 
Bordeaux Airport the day before, the country's aviation authorities said.
The Irish carrier's climbdown came too late for the 149 passengers who had been forced to disembark from their 
Thursday afternoon flight to London when the jet was impounded on the tarmac.
France's civil aviation directorate earlier said it was "regrettable" the plane had to be impounded "as a last resort" in 
order to recoup state aid to Ryanair that the European Union had ruled was illegal.
The passengers experienced a five-hour delay but made it to their destination with a later Ryanair flight, the 
directorate said.
In 2014, the European Commission said Ryanair had to repay 858,000 euros' (973,000 dollars') worth of rebates 
and marketing arrangements it received at Angouleme airport, not far from Bordeaux.
The EU at the time also ordered authorities to recoup money from Ryanair and Transavia over benefits they had 
received at two other French regional airports.
Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment. The plane was released back to the airline at about 12:30 pm 
(1130 GMT) after the payment was received, authorities said.

PARIS (AP) â€” Storms, strikes, computer failures â€” you can now add "your plane has been seized by the 
government" to the list of things that can delay your flight.               
In France, 149 passengers were preparing to take off for London late Thursday when French authorities ordered 
their Ryanair Boeing 737 impounded.               
The budget carrier owed money and it was "regrettable that the state was forced" to evacuate the plane, the civil 
aviation authority said.               
The passengers had gone through passport control and security and were about to walk on the tarmac to board the 
plane when airport authorities told them to turn around, passenger Boris Hejblum said.               
"The airport staff told us there was an issue with the plane," he told The Associated Press in an email.               
No Ryanair staff members were available, and the only communication from the airline was two text messages 
saying simply that the departure was delayed, and a 5-euro ($5.75) voucher for food â€” "less than what a 
sandwich cost at the airport café," the 30-year-old Frenchman said.               
"I found it strange that the police were the only ones giving us information," he said.               
The passengers were put on another flight that finally brought them to London's Stansted airport â€” five hours late.               
The multi-million dollar jet, meanwhile, was released only Friday after Ryanair paid a bill of 525,000 euros 
($610,000).               
The scene unfolded at the Bordeaux-Merignac airport in western France, where authorities say the airline was 
ordered to pay back funds that the European Union had declared to be illegal subsidies. Ryanair did not publicly 
comment on the seizure.               
French aviation agency spokesman Eric Heraud said regional authorities who originally gave the subsidies had 
been trying since 2014 to recover the money, and sent its final legal warning in May. After six months without a 
response from Ryanair, it decided to act Friday.               
The standoff with French authorities will not help Ryanair, which more than most carriers, has come to symbolize 
budget airlines' relentless focus on the bottom line at the cost of customer service.               
France seizes jet at takeoff after Ryanair doesn't pay bill
Ryanair has become Europe's largest airline by number of passengers by persistently offering some of the 
cheapest fares available. That ensures its planes are packed.               
It then makes extra money with add-on fares. Besides charging for seating choice and food â€” now standard 
practice on budget flights the world over â€” it also has travelers pay for any carry-on bag that's larger than a purse.               
It manages to keep its costs down by flying to out of the way airports at odd hours to get cheaper airport slots.               
Its CEO, Michael O'Leary, personifies the airline's brash approach, sparring with unions and EU authorities. And 
despite conceding in 2013 that "we should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off," the airline 
retains its reputation as something to be endured for the sake of flying cheaply around Europe.               
"I would say we just took it as another Ryanair problem, having no information from them," Hejblum said of 
Thursday's incident. "When we found out about the seizure, I would say the general sentiment was to blame 
Ryanair for not complying with the law."

Nov 09, 2018( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A female airline 
passenger was caught on camera hurling abusive, racist and homophobic attack on a man sitting near her on a 
plane. The shocking video, which was obtained by the Sun and Mirror Online, showed the woman shouting and 
swearing in front of young children. It remains unclear what triggered the woman to launch the angry tirade at her 
co-passenger as theplane prepared to land at Los Angeles International Airport. 
The airline in which the incident took place was also not mentioned by those who shared the video on social media. 
According to reports, the woman shouted at fellow passengers and crew members for "about an hour."The 
passenger was also said to have 'threatened a flight attendant' shortly before the plane landed. In the video, she 
can be heard saying: "You're a gay-looking a--- n-----" and "you're a white skin a--- n------." When she was asked to 
watch her language because of the young child nearby, she continued to shout. She can be heard repeating: 
"That's not my kid, I don't give a f--k," before adding: "Shut your f------king mouth, it's got nothing to do with you." At 
one point the woman stood up, leaning across the seat, getting closer and closer to the man, telling him: "Stop 
talking s--- and do something." The clip also reportedly shows a flight attendant trying to calm the woman while a 
passenger tells her to 'chill.' The video was taken on Nov. 2, the Sun[1] reported. A passenger who took the footage 
said: "Shortly before this video was filmed she threatened a flight attendant who appeared to come up and try to 
calm here after other attendants had been unsuccessful...That flight attendant called for ground control and I 
assume the police who did end up escorting her off the flight once we landed." He added: "She used racially tinged 
language and homophobic slurs on flight personnel as well as passengers." A view inside a Boeing 787 Dreamliner 
aircraft at the Vienna airport, Dec. 17, 2012. Photo: REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader This comes weeks after another 
incident which took place on board a Ryanair flight when a male passengersubjected a fellow passenger to a racist 
tirade. Delsie Gayle became the target of the tirade of abuse by a fellow passenger on flight FR015 from Barcelona, 
Spain, to London Stansted in mid-October. A video of the incident showsa man shouting at Gayle, telling her to 
move seats, while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled. 'I don't care whether 
she's fucking disabled or not - if I tell her to get out, she gets out,' the man can be heard saying,calling the woman 
an 'ugly black b-------.'When Gayle remonstrates with him he shouts at her: 'Don't talk to me in a foreign language, 
you stupid ugly cow.' Describing her shock,the 77-year-oldtold ITV News[2]:'I feel very low. He paid a fare to go on 
holiday, I've paid mine, so why does he abuse me for that due to the colour of my skin? He do it with me and he 
gets away, he'll do it to somebody else.' Later, the man -- identified asDavid Mesher -- claimed thathe is not a racist 
and

his 
temper 
'a 
bit.'

also

Watch: Ryanair Passenger Avoids Carry-On Baggage Fees By Sewing Clothes Into Coat
Watch: Ryanair Passenger Avoids Carry-On Baggage Fees By Sewing 
Clothes Into Coat

Nov 09, 2018( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A Staffordshire, 
England, man who grew frustrated with the extreme, new baggage policies of Ireland-based Ryanair, sewed his 
clothes into acoat to avoid the fees for carry-on bags, reports said Thursday. According to the new policies, which 
was revamped for the second time this year, passengers were only allowed one small bag, which must fit below the 
seat in front of them, free of charge. The new policy, announced in August, came into effect from Nov. 
1. Lee Cimino, 30, booked a ticket to Belfast,Northern Ireland, for his birthday through Ryanair two days before the 
new fee was put into place. With the new rule in place, he would have had to pay up to $11 for a large carry-on 
bag.However, Cimino figured out a hack to carry his clothes on board without having to pay the extra baggage fee. 
So instead of packing his rollaway suitcase, he sewed on every article of clothing he needed into a giant and bulky 
coat he could wear on the plane.Cimino found himself a tailor who helped him create pockets using his clothes,and 
then stuffed them with the rest of his clothing, toiletries and every other article he would require during the travel. He 
shared his whole experience in a video posted on Facebook[1] with the caption: 'This is for you if you've ever been 
frustrated by Ryanair. This is how you get around the new baggage charges every time. It might even make you 
smile.' Cimino said he was at first unsure if the idea would work since the coat was quite bulky and obvious, 
reported Fox News[2]. But, as seen in the video, he made it to Belfast with his coat/suitcase intact. [embedded 
content] 'I fly with Ryanair all over, so I'm clued up when it comes to their bag rules. It's not breaking any rules to try 
and take all of your luggage in your clothes, so I took an old coat out of my cupboard and took it to Sew Wot Tailors 
in Tunstall to see what they could do for around [$33-$39],' he said according to a report on the New York Post.[3] 
'There was no scene created because we weren't trying to make a scene, we just wanted to do it in a discreet 
manner to see if we could and to prove that you could get onto the plane still carrying what you needed,' Cimino 
said. Reports said Cimino intended to auction his coat and give half of the profit to a charity of Ryanair's choice. A 
Ryanair passenger sewed clothes on to his coat to avoid paying carry-on baggage charges. In this image: A man 
pulling a suitcase walks past a billboard advertisement for Ryanair during a 24-hour strike by its pilots in 
Schoenefeld, Germany, Aug. 10, 2018. Photo: Getty Images/Sean Gallup Previously, Ryanair passengers were 
allowed to carry one bigger bag, tagged at the gate and put in the plane's hold, with them for free. However, only 
passengers who purchase priority boarding will be able to check in their larger bags for free. According to the 
airline's website[4], priority boarding plus two cabin bags charges start at an extra 6 (about $7.74) per ticket. At the 
same time, the airline has changed its definition of a small bag from 13.7'' x 7.8'' x 7.8'' to 16.4''x 7.8'' x 11.8''. 'This 
new policy will speed up the boarding and cut flight delays,' Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, said 
according to a report on Travel + Leisure[5]. '60% of customers will be unaffected by these changes and we expect

that the other 40% will either choose to buy Priority Boarding or a 10kg check bag or will choose to travel with only 
one 
(free) 
small 
bag 
as 
30% 
already 
do 
so 
today.'

Body
The economy is the closest it has been to full employment since the early 1970s, with the jobless rate now at 4 per 
cent, and companies are finding it harder to hire the right workers.
Some companies are expecting it will become even more difficult to recruit once the UK leaves the EU because the 
government is proposing a new immigration regime that lets some high skilled workers into the UK but places curbs 
on untrained labour.
After years of sluggish wage growth, low unemployment is starting to hit companies' profits: JD Wetherspoon, Royal 
Mail and Ryanair have recently complained about rising labour costs.
The Financial Times has reviewed official and other data to identify the five sectors of the economy that have the 
worst labour shortages.
Hospitality
Chefs were the most in-demand skilled trade in the UK last year, according to the government's 2017 Employers 
Skills Survey published in August. This was one reason why hotels and restaurants had the highest level of so-
called hardto-fill job vacancies of any part of the economy in the survey.
Shortage of workers hits five sectors as economy nears full employment; Companies struggle to find right staff 
and warn of blow to profits caused by higher pay
These figures have been backed up by the latest official labour market statistics, from August, which found that 
accommodation and food services had the highest vacancy rate of any industry in the UK - with 4.1 advertised 
positions for every 100 people employed in the sector.
Pub chain JD Wetherspoon issued a profit warning on Wednesday and also said it was raising wages for staff amid 
record low unemployment.
Demographics are the problem, said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of Hospitality UK, a trade body. About half the 
workers in a sector that encompasses everything from cafés to nightclubs is aged under 30 and there are far fewer 
18 to 24-year-olds entering the job market because of a dip in the birth rate around the turn of millennium.
"It's what makes Brexit … so worrying for hospitality," added Ms Nichols. "It's not skill shortages, not a failure to 
upskill our workers, simply a shortage of bodies available."
There is, however, a shortage of qualified chefs because the number of people going to catering colleges has 
declined.
Information technology
Information technology was last year the sector with the second highest proportion of hard-to-fill vacancies, the 
Employers Skills Survey found.
IT was the most in-demand skill set this year across multiple industries, according to a survey published last month 
by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, a trade body. Software engineers and programmers were 
particularly sought after, with many respondents to the survey mentioning automation and cyber security as vital 
skills.
"It's a high growth area, the tech sector specifically, and we're not producing the right skills domestically," said 
Vinous Ali, head of policy at Tech UK, a trade body.
IT workers from overseas were frequently finding they were unable to move to the UK last year, she added, as the 
sector bumped up against a cap on visas issued to skilled workers. "Businesses [will go] elsewhere if they can't get 
access to the right people here in the UK," said Ms Ali.
Construction
The building trade had the greatest rate of vacancies based on skills shortages, meaning positions left open for six 
months or more because of a lack of adequately trained applicants, the Employers Skills Survey found. The sector 
also had the third highest rate of hard-to-fill vacancies.
The shortage of skilled workers is reflected in official wage growth figures. In the three months to August, year-
onyear growth in real wages in the construction industry hit 4.6 per cent, compared with 3.1 per cent in the 
economy as a whole.
Skills shortages in the sector have been common since 2014, when construction activity started to recover after the 
downturn following the financial crisis, said Rebecca Larkin, chief economist at the Construction Products 
Association, a trade body.
Many construction workers quit the industry during that downtown, she added, while a lot who stayed are now 
heading for retirement and some EU nationals may have been discouraged from coming to the UK since the Brexit 
vote. So far the skills shortages have led to higher wages and a squeeze on construction companies' profit margins 
rather than higher costs for customers, said Ms Larkin.
Healthcare
Shortage of workers hits five sectors as economy nears full employment; Companies struggle to find right staff 
and warn of blow to profits caused by higher pay
Vacancies in the healthcare sector have surged during the past few years, official data show. The vacancy rate has 
risen from 2 open positions for every 100 employed workers in 2013, to 3.2.
The sector has been hit hard by public spending cuts since 2010. Workers in the National Health Service were 
affected by a public sector pay freeze, leading to remuneration falling in real terms, while local authorities cut 
funding for care homes.
Emily Andrews, associate director at the Institute for Government, a think-tank, said the government's move to ease 
the pay cap was unlikely to be enough to end the recruitment and retention problems in the NHS.
"The number of people leaving the NHS who cite work-life balance as their reason has doubled since 2011," she 
added. "These pretty small pay increases are not going to be enough to counter that."
Leisure and other services
Respondents to the Employers Skills Survey told the Department for Education that there were "emerging labour 
shortages" in some smaller leisurerelated industries, especially hairdressers, barbers and beauticians.
"It's part of a success story," said Hilary Hall, chief executive of the National Hair and Beauty Federation, a trade 
body.
"Walk down any high street and you'll see just how many businesses of this kind there are."
As shopping has moved online, nail bars, tattoo parlours and coffee shops have proliferated along the high street.
But like hospitality, the beauty sector has struggled to attract new workers as roughly half of the workers in this area 
tend to be under 30.
'It's not skill shortages, not a failure to upskill our workers, simply a shortage of bodies available'

France has impounded a plane operated by budget carrier Ryanair at Bordeaux Airport in order to recoup state aid 
paid to the Irish airline, aviation authorities said on Friday.
The plane's 149 passengers, heading to London, were already on board and had to disembark when the aircraft 
was seized on Thursday evening, the airport said.
The passengers experienced a five-hour delay but made it to their destination with a later Ryanair flight, France's 
civil aviation directorate said.
It was "regrettable" that the plane had to be impounded "as a last resort" after several efforts to get Ryanair to repay 
the subsidies had failed, the directorate said.
In 2014, the European Commission said Ryanair had to repay 858,000 euros' (973,000 dollars') worth of rebates 
and marketing arrangements it received at Angouleme airport.
The EU at the time also ordered authorities to recoup money from Ryanair and Transavia over benefits they had 
received at two other French regional airports.
Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A Ryanair aircraft at Bordeaux airport was today seized by French authorities as part of efforts to reclaim state aid 
paid to the carrier.
In a statement French aviation authority DGAC says it had to impound the Boeing 737 as part of efforts to reclaim 
subsidies paid to the low-cost carrier for flights from Angouleme airport between 2008 and 2009.
In 2014 the European Commission adjudged the subsidies constituted illegal state aid and ordered that the money 
be repaid. The ruling was contested by Ryanair. In 2015, the Commission referred the French state to the European 
Court of Justice, alleging failure to recover the money.
The DGAC says the decision to impound the aircraft was taken as a "last resort" after several formal notices and 
attempts to recover the money failed.
It says the aircraft will remain immobilised until an undisclosed sum is repaid. A subsequent local newswire report, 
citing a DGAC spokesman, say the aircraft will be released as the funds have now been paid.
The airline did not respond to a request for comment.

 Ryanair Holdings PLC is to operate 11 new routes from Edinburgh Airport beginning in summer 2019.
A service to Luxembourg and Billund in Denmark will run all year through while new summer routes include Lisbon, 
Stockholm and Tallinn.
The low-cost airline said its 58 routes would deliver 3.5 million passengers through Edinburgh Airport next year.
A spokesman said: "We will also base an additional aircraft at Edinburgh as we continue to grow traffic, routes, 
tourism and jobs."
The other new routes are Berlin, Derry, Memmingen, Riga, Seville and Sofia.
Meanwhile, British Airways has announced an expansion of its Inverness to Heathrow service.
The airline will operate two daily return services from Monday to Friday and three return services at weekends from 
next summer.
The route from London to the Highland capital was reinstated in 2016.
The expanded schedule means business people will be able to travel between the two cities and complete a full 
working day before returning home the same day.
BA said it had been able to increase flights to Inverness because the hub, run by Highlands and Islands Airports, is 
exempt from air passenger duty.
Phyllis Stuart, British Airways' airport manager in Inverness, said: "Since we reintroduced the daily service between 
Inverness and Heathrow we have seen steady growth in passenger numbers at both ends of the route and this 
further expansion is testament to the support our partners at Inverness Airport, and the people and business 
community of the Highlands and Islands, have given us over the past two years.
Ryanair To Launch 11 New Routes From Edinburgh Starting Summer 2019
"The new schedule will bring greater economic benefits to the region and the extra flights on Saturdays and 
Sundays will cater for the number of leisure passengers travelling to the Highlands and Islands during the summer 
months."

Ryanair reaches deal with German cabin crew union

Ryanair has reached an agreement with German union Verdi relating to pay and conditions for cabin crew that will 
be put to workers for approval next Tuesday, the Irish budget airline said on Thursday.
Ryanair has been hit by a series of strikes across Europe despite bowing to pressure to recognize unions for the 
first time almost a year ago.
The two-year Collective Labour Agreement covers all the airline's cabin crew based in Germany and confirms the 
application of German labor law and includes pay increases and other benefits, Ryanair said.
Verdi, which represents about 1,000 Ryanair cabin crew in Germany, said the agreement would only become final 
once its members had been able to vote on it.
"After nearly a year of negotiation, Verdi sees the preliminary agreement as a step toward improving the working 
conditions of workers and their salaries," it said in a statement, adding it would comment on details of the 
agreement once it had been finalized.
Ryanair said last month it hoped to reach deals with all of its major unions by Christmas, seeking to end disruptions 
which have hit its profit and shares.
Verdi said it still saw it as problematic that Ryanair does not allow its employees to form works councils and called 
on lawmakers to introduce new rules for the sector as a whole.
The airline also said its Italian cabin crew have voted overwhelmingly to accept a three-year deal reached with their 
three main cabin crew unions in September.

"We are pleased to sign this CLA agreement with Verdi, which will lead to pay improvements and other benefits for 
our German based cabin crew, subject to them voting in favor of this agreement over the coming week," Ryanair's 
Chief People Officer, Eddie Wilson, said in a statement.
"These are further concrete signs of the substantial progress Ryanair is making in concluding agreements with our 
people and their unions in many different EU countries."
Ryanair has also signed new recognition agreements with cabin crew unions in Greece and Sweden and will start 
work with these unions on deals to cover cabin crew in those countries. (Reuters)

Ryanair has come to an agreement with the union Verdi in a dispute over wages paid to German cabin crew, the 
budget airline said on Thursday.
The deal, which according to Ryanair includes pay increases and other benefits, is yet to be approved in a cabin 
crew ballot. Ryanair expects the vote to take place in the coming week.
Verdi confirmed the deal with Ryanair without giving further details.
The company said it was "pleased" to sign the agreement, which follows similar deals in Italy, Greece and Sweden.
The Irish air carrier said these were "concrete signs of the substantial progress Ryanair is making in concluding 
agreements with our people and their unions in many different EU countries."
Verdi had been pushing for Ryanair to comply fully with German labour law - a move Ryanair says has now been 
confirmed.
Ryanair cabin staff in several European countries went on strike in September. Ryanair workers in Germany also 
took part, with Verdi saying the company's pay offer was unsatisfactory.
As a result of industrial action in August, Ryanair struck off some 400 flights in European countries, including 150 in 
Germany.

JD Wetherspoon issued a profit warning yesterday in a further sign of how rising wages are starting to erode 
corporate profitability in the UK.
Shares in the pub chain fell sharply after it said it was increasing wages from this week and its full-year profits 
would be lower as a result.
The tight labour market has prompted other companies, including Royal Mail and Ryanair, to warn that profits are 
being hit by rising staff costs.
The warnings reflect how salaries have finally started to rise in the UK after years of stagnation. Wage growth 
reached its highest level since the financial crisis in the three months to the end of August, with average weekly 
earnings, excluding bonuses, 3.1 per cent higher than a year earlier.
The rate of wage growth was the fastest since the recession that followed the financial crisis in 2008, and the first 
time the headline rate of pay growth has been higher than 3 per cent in a decade.
Meanwhile, the number of people in work is at a near-record high, and unemployment, at 4 per cent in August, is at 
its lowest since the mid-1970s.
Rising wages blamed for profits hit ? TUC points to record corporate earnings ; ? Unemployment at lowest 
since mid-1970s
Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said recruiters were reporting 
significant rises in starting salaries. "This is feeding through to both pay settlements and government pay awards 
which are heading towards 3 per cent," he said. "We've not seen this[level sustained] since before the financial 
crisis." Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: "Workers have been suffering the 
longest pay slump in 200 years, while corporate profits have continued to hit record levels.
"And in companies like Wetherspoons, some staff are still paid less than the living wage, despite record profits."
So far, higher labour costs have not been passed on to shoppers. Consumer price inflation fell to 2.4 per cent in 
September from 2.7 per cent in August. And, despite the recent pick-up in wages, once adjusted for inflation, they 
remain below their pre-crisis peak.
Tim Martin, Wetherspoon chairman, said that after several years of record profits, "we are not immediately seeking 
to recoup these increased costs through higher pricing". Shares in the pub operator fell 12 per cent.
The national living wage of £7.83, which all employers are obliged to pay to workers aged over 25, is due to rise to 
£8.21 next year.

increases and other benefits, is yet to be approved in a cabin crew ballot. Ryanair expects the vote to take place in 
the coming week.  Verdi confirmed the deal with Ryanair without giving further details.  The company said it was 
'pleased' to sign the agreement, which follows similar deals in Italy, Greece and Sweden.  The Irish air carrier said 
these were 'concrete signs of the substantial progress Ryanair is making in concluding agreements with our people 
and their unions in many different EU countries.'  Verdi had been pushing for Ryanair to comply fully with German 
labour law - a move Ryanair says has now been confirmed.  Ryanair cabin staff in several European countries went 
on strike in September. Ryanair workers in Germany also took part, with Verdi saying the company's pay offer was 
unsatisfactory.  As a result of industrial action in August, Ryanair struck off some 400 flights in European countries, 
including 150 in Germany.   Copyright dpa

       MOSCOW (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair confirmed that it has signed a Collective Labour Agreement or CLA framework 
and Social Plan with Ver.di, the German cabin crew union, to cover all of Ryanair's German based cabin crew.   
The agreement (which is now subject to a cabin crew ballot) confirms the application of German labour law to 
Ryanair's cabin crew and delivers pay increases and other benefits for all Ryanair German based cabin crew over 
the next two years.  Ryanair also confirmed that its Italian cabin crew have voted overwhelmingly (88%) in favour of 
the CLA signed recently between Ryanair and the 3 main cabin crew unions FIT CISL, ANPAC, and ANPAV. The 
CLA, which delivers pay and benefit improvements, will now apply to all of Ryanair's cabin crew in Italy for the next 
3 years.  Over the past week, Ryanair has also signed new recognition agreements with cabin crew unions in 
Greece (RACU) and Sweden (UNIONEN). Ryanair will now work with these unions on long term CLAs to cover 
cabin crew in Greece and Sweden.

RYANAIR and longtime chief executive Michael O'Leary have been sued in New York by a shareholder that said 
the airline defrauded investors and inflated its share price by overstating its ability to manage labor relations and 
keep costs down.
The complaint was filed on Tuesday night in the US District Court in Manhattan by an Alabama pension fund, 
seeking class-action status and damages for investors in Ryanair's American depositary shares from 30 May 2017 
to 28 September 2018.
In a statement yesterday, Dublinbased Ryanair said it will defend itself against the claims, which it called "false" and 
"doomed to fail".
According to the complaint, Ryanair misled investors in regulatory filings and conference calls about its labor 
stability, including "industry leading" contracts with pilots and cabin crews, and its positive impact on operations.
Ryanair cited labor issues when it cut its full-year profit forecast on 1 October, causing shares to drop a third from 
their March levels.

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Low-cost airline Ryanair has sacked six cabin staff over a photograph of them appearing 
to sleep on the floor of an airport crew room, insisting that the picture was staged to back a 'false claim.'  The six 
cabin staff, who were based in Porto in Portugal, were dismissed from their jobs on Monday 'for breach of contract 
on grounds of gross misconduct,' Ryanair said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. 
 The airline said the group had staged 'a fake photograph to support a false claim - widely reported in international 
media outlets - that they were 'forced to sleep on the floor' of the Malaga crew room.'  It said their action had 
'damaged their employer's reputation and caused an irreparable breach of trust' with Ryanair.  After the photograph 
circulated on social media last month, Ryanair posted footage from a security camera in the room, which showed 
uniformed staff sitting on chairs in the room before some of them went to lie on the floor to pose for the picture.  
Portuguese trade union SNPVAC, which represents the staff, said earlier that the photograph was 'a gesture of 
protest' against the conditions they endured after they were stranded in Spain by a storm.  The Ryanair staff were 
not given hotel rooms and were left 'without the minimum legal requirements for suitable accommodation,' with 
inadequate access to food and drink, and enough seating for only one-third of them, the union said.  It said 
Ryanair's claim that the viral photograph was staged was itself 'fake news.'   Copyright dpa

Nov 07, 2018( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Following six of 
Ryanair crew members staging a photo showing them sleeping on the airport floor, which went viral on social 
media, everyone who were responsible for the act were fired by the airline company, citing a breach in contract. 'All 
6 cabin crew members in Porto were dismissed on Mon 5 Nov for breach of contract on grounds of gross 
misconduct, after staging a fake photograph to support a false claim (widely reported in international media outlets) 
that they were 'forced to sleep on the floor' of the Malaga crew room, which was behavior which damaged their 
employer's reputation and caused an irreparable breach of trust with these 6 persons,' a Ryanair spokesperson said 
of the decision to sack the employees, Mirror Online[1] reported. The photo in question showed six members of the 
airline's staff curled up on a carpet on the floor of Malaga Airport, Spain, next to printers and other office supplies in 
the crew roomOct. 
13, after four Portugal-bound Ryanair flights were diverted due to the tropical thunderstorm Leslie. It was originally 
shared by the Facebook page of 'Ryanair Must Change.' The photo was then shared by ex-Ryanair pilot Jim 
Atkinson which truly caused it to go viral:'Upon arrival to Malaga airport, the 24 crew [8 pilots and 16 cabin crew] 
were placed in a room, without the minimum rest facilities, where the Crew that are based on that airport perform 
their briefings and where Ryanair has their Malaga offices. The 24 crew members were there since 01h30 until 
06:00 local time [7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. EST, Oct. 12] without access to food, drinks and even a place to sit down, as 
there were only 8 seats available for the 24 crew,' Ryanair Must Change said in a separate Facebook post. While 
the airline's Chief Operations Officer Peter Bellew said the company had apologized to its staff for being unable to 
arrange hotel accommodations for its employees, Ryanair said in a separate statement the photo circulating online 
was 'staged' as 'no crew 'slept on the floor'." 'The crew spent a short period of time in the crew room before being 
moved to a VIP lounge, and returned to Porto the next day [none of the crew operated flights],' the statement 
added. After the original story about the viral photo was published, Ryanair sent International Business Times a 
surveillance footage[2] from the crew room from the same day that the picture was taken, as evidence to prove their 
claim of the photo being staged. The company also issued the following statement: 'The publication of this video 
reveals the facts and exposes the SNPVAC union fake news/false claims. This video proves that the original picture 
was staged and no crew 'slept on the floor'. All Ryanair offices and crew rooms are equipped for security reasons 
with CCTV cameras and notifications of same as required by GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation],' Ryanair 
told IBT in a statement. Luciana Passo, head of the SNPVAC, which represents Portuguese airline crews, which 
had pushed back against Ryanair's original claim of the photo being staged last month, promised a swift response 
to the airline's 'awful' decision. 'Ryanair thinks it was harmed by the publication of that photograph when it was no 
more than a show of the crew members' justified feeling of indignation,' Passo said, adding, 'The union's legal team 
Ryanair Crew Who Staged Viral Photo Of Sleeping On Airport Floor, Fired
are now dealing with the matter.' Following six of Ryanair crew members staging a photo showing them sleeping on 
the airport floor, which went viral on social media, everyone who were responsible for the act were fired by the 
airline company. In this photo, a Ryanair cabin crew member and union representative arrives ahead of a press 
conference held by Ryanair unions representatives, in Brussels, Sept. 13, 2018. Photo: Getty Images/ Emmanuel

Irish budget airline Ryanair and its chief executive Michael O'Leary are being sued for allegedly providing 
misleading information to investors on the company's relations with some workers.
A pension fund in Alabama accuses Ryanair of deceiving investors about conflicts with pilots and other employees, 
which caused clear losses in the company's stock market value, according to a complaint lodged at a New York 
court.
Ryanair rejected the accusations levelled against it on Wednesday, saying that the "claims are doomed to fail as 
they have no basis in fact or reality."
The pension fund is seeking compensation for damages due to the decline in share prices. It wants to pursue the 
case as a class action lawsuit, hoping that other investors will follow suit.
It remains to be seen whether the court will approve or throw out the legal complaint.

Russian budget airline Pobeda is committing to acquiring 20 Boeing 737 Max 8s, with an option to convert some to 
the high-density “Max 200” variant.
It is to take 15 of the aircraft from lessor SMBC Aviation Capital and another five from GECAS, it states in a formal 
procurement notice.
Pobeda’s aircraft from SMBC will come with a conversion option to switch seven of them to the “Max 200” 
configuration.
This version has 197 seats, compared with the normal 189, and has already been ordered by the budget carriers 
Ryanair and VietJet.
The five GECAS aircraft will all be regular 737-8s, the airline’s notice indicates.
Pobeda puts the value of the SMBC batch at $1.23 billion and that of the GECAS aircraft at $375 million.
The aircraft are all exclusively powered by CFM International Leap-1B engines.
Moscow Vnukovo-based Pobeda, part of the Aeroflot Group, is already a 737-800 operator, but had recently 
signalled that it was looking at the re-engined Max variant during a recruitment drive for pilots.
Pobeda estimates that the delivery of the SMBC aircraft will begin in November 2019 and run to November 2021, 
while that of the GECAS jets will take place in the first half of 2020.

Deliveries climb on rate increases; September saw more twin-aisle aircraft

New commercial aircraft sales totalled 99 units during September, which, when counting 14 cancellations and 16 
swaps, resulted in 85 net orders, information from Flight Fleets Analyzer shows.
As has been the case in all but three months so far this year, commitments for narrowbody types dominated 
business, with a total of 62 aircraft in this category ordered. This included 36 Airbus A320neo-family single-aisles, 
and 33 from Boeing’s 737 Max range.
Mexican low-cost carrier VivaAerobus firmed an order for 25 A321neos, and swapped a previous deal for 16 
A320neos in favour of the larger variant. Fleets Analyzer records the operator as using 22 A320ceos and six 
A320neos. Other buyers for Airbus narrowbodies included Swiss, which ordered three A321neos and seven 
A320neos, and SalamAir, which signed for one example of the same model.
Boeing’s sales total for the Max included 23 units for undisclosed customers, plus 10 737-8s for Nigerian buyer Air 
Peace. It also saw orders for seven Max-series aircraft cancelled.
Net widebody sales during September totalled only eight aircraft: a doubling from the previous month’s four, but still 
the third-worst result so far in 2018. However, Boeing reported orders for 15 787s: nine -9s for United Airlines, 
another for Boeing Capital and five more for unidentified customers.
Regional aircraft orders were led by Swiss carrier Helvetic Airways’ commitment for 12 Embraer 190-E2s, while 
Biman Bangladesh Airlines ordered three Bombardier Q400 twin-turboprops.
At the end of September, the overall commercial order backlog stood at 15,034 aircraft: a reduction of 96 from the 
previous month. Fleets Analyzer shows that total sales through the first nine months of the year reached 1,008 
units, including 661 narrowbodies, 222 widebodies, 70 regional jets and 55 turboprops.
Deliveries climb on rate increases September saw more twin-aisle aircraft shipped than during any previous 
month this year, but widebody sales remained weak, as....
September was the third busiest month of the year so far for deliveries, with shipments totalling 172 aircraft made to 
76 operators. This marked a 12% increase over the same month in 2017. Close to 60% of all deliveries – 102 
aircraft – went to mainline operators.
Some 114 narrowbodies were transferred, including 11 for China Eastern Airlines: six A320neos and five 737-800s. 
China Southern Airlines took three units each of the A320neo, 737 Max and 737-800, while Ryanair added eight 
737-800s to its fleet.
The month was the busiest so far in 2018 for widebody shipments, with a total of 41 aircraft transferred to 23 
operators. Qatar Airways took eight, divided equally between the A350 and 777. Hainan Airlines took six 787s and 
a single A350, while fellow Chinese carrier Shanghai Airlines received its first 787-9.
A dozen regional jets were also transferred, including five E175s and a single Bombardier CRJ900 for US carrier 
SkyWest Airlines, and two Sukhoi Superjet 100s transferred to Aeroflot – including its 50th example of the type.
Indian low-cost carrier IndiGo received two ATR 72-600s, from a monthly total of five turboprop deliveries.
The geographical split for the month’s shipments shows that 97 units went to operators in the Asia-Pacific region, 
while European and North American recipients took 28 and 26 airliners, respectively.
Fleets Analyzer shows that the global fleet totalled 29,586 aircraft at the end of September: a month-on-month 
climb of 68.

BUDGET airline Ryanair saw an 11 per cent increase in traffic in October, as it carried 13.1m passengers.
The total includes 500,000 passengers from Lauda, the airline founded by former Formula One champion Niki 
Lauda and recently acquired by Ryanair.
When taking into account Ryanair alone, traffic grew seven per cent on last year to 12.6m customers, with a load 
factor - a measure of how full an aircraft is - of 96 per cent.
The airline has endured a turbulent 2018 owing to its industrial disputes with pilots and cabin crew over pay and 
working conditions.
In addition to staff strikes, Ryanair said it was forced to cancel 300 flights last month owing to a five-day strike by 
Avia Partner baggage handlers at Brussels airport, poor weather conditions and Air Traffic Control (ATC) shortages.
Ryanair's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: "During October, we were forced to cancel just over 300 flights 
because of a five day airport handler strike at Brussels Zaventem, some adverse weather (winter storms) and 
continuing ATC staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France.
"We operated over 71,400 scheduled flights with over 80 per cent of these flights arriving on time, as Ryanair 
continues to deliver the lowest fares, with the best punctuality of any major EU airline," Jacobs added.

Want to make it big in television? Join a low-cost airline! Until last year, this advice only really held good for Brian 
Dowling. You know, Brian Dowling - the former Ryanair flight attendant who won the second series of reality TV 
show Big Brother. ITV gave him his own series called Brian's Boyfriends, featured him as a contestant on Hell's 
Kitchen, and made him the presenter of Real Housewives of Cheshire on ITVBe. You know, Brian Dow ... (actually, 
me neither, I had to Google all of that).
But it's now a career route that has started to work out for certain easyJet employees, too. Since the airline's chief 
executive, Carolyn McCall won the top job at ITV in 2017, several others have made the short hop from Luton 
airport to central London. Yesterday, her chief financial officer at easyJet between 2010 and 2015, Chris Kennedy, 
was appointed to the ITV CFO role. "I know he will work really well with the senior leadership team of ITV," Dame 
Carolyn said. That may be partly because the leadership team includes their former easyJet colleague, Kyla 
Mullins, who has been brought in as head of legal. "Kyla brings great commercial and strategic experience and 
acumen," Dame Carolyn told Legal Business last month. And that may be partly because her quotes are now 
distributed by former easyJet communications chief Paul Moore, who became ITV's communications director this 
year. "He brings with him a wealth of PR experience," Dame Carolyn told ... you get the gist.
Still, aside from making annual reunions of the easyJet Mutual Appreciation Society easier to organise, the most 
recent appointment does makes a lot of sense, for two reasons.
EasyJet to ITV is now a career route for high-flying executives; UK COMPANIES
First, it lessens the execution risk - or chance of a personality clash - as Dame Carolyn implements her strategy for 
cutting ITV's reliance on declining TV advertising - which last year contributed 44 per cent of group revenue. One 
analyst said: "Given the new CFO has worked closely with Carolyn in the past, it seems as good a set-up as any to 
execute on that."
Second, despite being hired from struggling FTSE 100 software group Micro Focus - where his main task was 
issuing a profit warning - ITV stressed Mr Kennedy's 17 years at music business EMI, where he worked on the kind 
of digital content licensing deals that ITV now seeks, plus his CFO role at UK technology pioneer Arm Holdings 
"where he was a key player in [the] £24bn, 60+ price/earnings [ratio] sale of Arm to SoftBank".
However, as Big Brother contestants were often warned, ITV might want to think about how it comes across.
Its specific reference to the Arm sale - and mention of the earnings multiple achieved - led another analyst to 
conclude "it may also be a flag that ITV is open to a sale". And its continued hiring of easyJet executives may leave 
Dame Carolyn open to criticism of surrounding herself with, er, appreciative former colleagues. Worse still, it might 
even inspire senior ITV execs to mutter "Doors to manual" whenever her entourage approaches.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.----------COMPANIES----------Micro Focus International 
extended its share buyback programme as it reported the departure of its finance head. The business software 
company appointed Brian McArthur-Muscroft to replace current Chief Financial Officer Chris Kennedy, who will be 
leaving in the first quarter of 2019 to join broadcaster ITV. McArthur-Muscroft is currently a senior independent 
director at recruitment firm Robert Walters. Previously he has served as CFO at telecom firm TeleCity Group and 
online payments company Paysafe Group. 
The company also announced its intention to recommence its share buyback programme, with any shares bought 
back to be held in treasury. In addition, Micro Focus highlighted that it traded in line with the board's expectations in 
the year to the end of October, as it saw revenue improvements in the second half. On a constant currency basis, 
the company expects revenue to come in better end of the guidance of 6% to 9% reduction. ----------Hiscox said it 
enjoyed "strong" growth in an "active" third quarter which saw the insurer's total gross written premiums increase, 
as it prepares for Brexit with its European subsidiary expected to start writing business from next year. For the nine 
months ended September, Hiscox reported a 14% year-on-year increase in total gross written premiums to 
USD3.04 billion from USD2.66 billion. "We have had strong growth, but as the market remains challenging, we will 
remain disciplined, and I expect our growth to moderate over the balance of the year. It has been an active third 
quarter for claims across the group, both from large losses and catastrophes, and I am pleased with how we have 
responded," said Chief Executive Bronek Masojada. Hiscox said both natural catastrophe and large claims 
increased in the third quarter after a "benign" first half. In particular, the company said catastrophes in the US and 
Far East represented a "more active environment".----------Ryanair reported a rise in October passenger traffic 
despite over 300 flight cancellations due to bad weather, strikes and air traffic control staff shortages. The Irish low-
cost airline reported 11% rise in traffic, including Lauda, to 13.1 million for October, up from 11.8 million the year 
before. Load factor for the month remained flat year-on-year at 96%. On a month-on month basis, traffic remained 
flat, while load factor dipped by one percentage point from 97% in September.----------MARKETS----------London

 Stocks in London are seen opening marginally lower on Monday, tracking Asian markets lower, as the US 
downplayed hopes of an imminent trade deal with China.
Enterprise software firm Micro Focus said its decline in annual revenue is expected to be at the better end of its 
previously guided range and it extended its share buyback programme, while also announcing the departure of its 
chief financial officer to broadcaster ITV. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open down 4.02 points at 7,090.10. The blue chip index closed 0.4% 
lower, or 20.54 points, at 7,094.12 on Friday. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.6%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.5%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 2.1%.
Asian stocks were lower on trade concerns after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow downplayed the 
potential for a quick trade deal between the US and China.
In early UK corporate news, Micro Focus International said trading has been in line with the company's 
expectations, with an "improved revenue trajectory" in the second half of the year.
The software firm said that, at constant currency, revenue will be around the upper end of the guidance of 6% to 9% 
decline for the financial year to the end of October, which was reiterated at the interim results in July.
Micro Focus said it will return a further USD229 million to shareholders via an extension of its share buyback 
programme.
Meanwhile, Chief Financial Officer Chris Kennedy will leave the company to join broadcaster ITV in the same role in 
first quarter of 2019. Micro Focus has appointed former Paysafe Group CFO as its new CFO, joining the company 
this month.

Ryanair Holdings said that in October traffic grew 11% to 13.1 million passengers from 11.8 million at the same time 
last year. The Irish carrier reported a 96% load factor for October, which is up from 95% a year before. 
"During October, we were forced to cancel just over 300 flights because of a five day airport handler strike at 
Brussels Zaventem, some adverse weather and continuing ATC staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France. 
We operated over 71,400 scheduled flights with over 80% of these flights arriving on time," Chief Marketing Officer 
Kenny Jacobs said. 
FTSE 250-listed outsourcer Capita said it completed the sale of its parking management business, ParkingEye, to 
Macquarie Principal Finance for GBP235 million.
FTSE 250-listed RPC Group said it extended the deadline for private equity firms Apollo Global Management and 
Bain Capital to make a firm offer for the plastic products maker to December 3. 
In economic news, China's private sector expanded at the weakest pace in more than two years in October with 
both services and manufacturing noting weaker performances, survey results from IHS Markit showed Monday.
The Caixin composite output index fell to a 28-month low of 50.5 in October from 52.1 in September. Service sector 
activity rose only marginally. The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to a 13-month low of 50.8 from 
53.1 in September. Meanwhile, manufacturing production stagnated, following increases in each of the preceding 
27 months.
In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.4%, S&P 500 down 
0.6% Nasdaq Composite down 1.0%. 
The US focus this week will be the US midterm elections on Tuesday and the US Federal Reserve's latest 
monetary policy decision, due on Thursday.
"The headline risk this week is the US mid-term elections, where the Democrats are widely expected to flip the 
House of Representatives. The resultant political deadlock could weigh on US indices and the dollar alike. This is a 
huge risk event for the market. We expecting to see investors selling out of positions and taking risk off the table 
ahead of the midterm elections," said London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler.
In addition, the Fed is due to announce its interest rate decision on Thursday. The US central bank is widely 
expected to leave rates unchanged, although the accompanying statement may provide clues about the anticipated 
rate hike next month. 
The pound was higher quoted at USD1.3006 early Monday against USD1.2964 at the London equities close Friday. 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May has reportedly secured a deal that will allow Britain to remain in the customs union 
after Brexit and avoid a hard Irish border, resolving the biggest stumbling block in negotiations with the EU.
A government spokesman in London, however, described as "speculation" the Sunday Times report which claimed 
May had made concessions to Brussels to resolve the so-called Irish question.
The spokesman merely told dpa that "good progress" had been made in the negotiations.
London and Brussels are currently at odds over how to prevent the return of a hard border between the Republic of 
Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will leave the EU with Britain at the end of March 2019.
The Times reported that according to the deal, remaining in the EU customs union will only be temporary. May is 
planning to discuss the plan with cabinet on Tuesday, the newspaper added.
The economic events calendar on Monday has services PMI readings from the UK at 0930 GMT and US at 1445 
GMT.

Curb growth of European airlines to ease disruption, says Lufthansa chief

The chief executive of Lufthansa has said the airline industry needs to give up the "fantasy of growth going on for 
ever" after a summer of strikes, delays and cancellations.
Problems with airspace, airports and new aircraft deliveries showed "this industry has reached its maximum growth 
rate", said Carsten Spohr, who is also the German carrier's chairman.
"What we need is healthy growth in line with infrastructure and manufacturers' capacity and airline capacity. We 
can't excuse ourselves; we are part of it."
Aviation capacity in Europe, measured by the number of seats, has increased about 6 per cent a year since 2016. 
That exceeds the industry's broad guide for sustainable growth of twice gross domestic product, which has recently 
been 2 per cent in Europe.
There are signs that this growth is leading to delays and disruption. In July, European airline passengers 
experienced more than 135,000 minutes of inflight delays on average each day. That is 94 days' worth of delays 
every day - more than double the year before.
In Mr Spohr's view, the sector has to moderate its expansionary plans to ease the pressure. The Lufthansa Group, 
which also owns Swiss, Austrian Airlines and low-cost Eurowings, will increase seat capacity by only 3.8 per cent 
next year while this winter overall European capacity will grow 8.8 per cent, according to Barclays.
Curb growth of European airlines to ease disruption, says Lufthansa chief
There are several problems contributing to European delays.
Lufthansa and other airlines suffered from Airbus's problems delivering its new A320neo aeroplane, which meant 
there were fewer spare aircraft in Europe to lease and use. There were shortages of, and strikes by, Europe's air 
traffic controllers as well, driving airlines including British Airways, Ryanair and easyJet to file complaints with the 
European Commission.
One proposed remedy for air traffic control disruption is known as the Single European Sky, which would 
amalgamate national airspace. Mr Spohr said SES was "overdue by many years" and required Europe's politicians 
to tackle national labour and political obstruction. "They have overcome resistance on the ground to create open 
borders in Schengen and there's no need why this shouldn't be done in the air as well."

The chief executive of Lufthansa has said the airline industry needs to give up the "fantasy of growth going on for 
ever" after a summer of strikes, delays and cancellations.
Problems with airspace, airports and new aircraft deliveries showed "this industry has reached its maximum growth 
rate", said Carsten Spohr, who is also the German carrier's chairman.
"What we need is healthy growth in line with infrastructure and manufacturers' capacity and airline capacity. We 
can't excuse ourselves; we are part of it."
Aviation capacity in Europe, measured by the number of seats, has increased about 6 per cent a year since 2016. 
That exceeds the industry's broad guide for sustainable growth of twice gross domestic product, which has recently 
been 2 per cent in Europe.
There are signs that this growth is leading to delays and disruption. In July, European airline passengers 
experienced more than 135,000 minutes of inflight delays on average each day. That is 94 days' worth of delays 
every day - more than double the year before.

Highlight: Ryanair has released October traffic statistics as follows:
Body
– Traffic grew 11% to 13.1m with a 96% load factor – Ryanair traffic grew 7% to 12.6m customers with a 96% load 
factor – Lauda traffic was 0.5m customers with an 89% load factorRyanair’s Kenny Jacobs said:“Ryanair’s Oct 
traffic (which includes Lauda) grew by 11% to 13.1m customers, due to lower fares and continuing success of 
Lauda’s summer schedule.During October, we were forced to cancel just over 300 flights because of a five day 
airport handler strike at Brussels Zaventem, some adverse weather (winter storms) and continuing ATC staff 
shortages in the UK, Germany and France. We operated over 71,400 scheduled flights with over 80% of these 
flights arriving on time, as Ryanair continues to deliver the lowest fares, with the best punctuality of any major EU 
airline.”

IAG raises forecasts and says it is 'significantly undervalued'
IAG raises forecasts and says it is 'significantly undervalued'

Airline group IAG, which owns British Airways, raised its earnings expectations for 2019-23 by more than 10 per 
cent to an average of (EURO)7.2bn each year.
In a presentation to analysts at its capital markets day yesterday, IAG predicted that, while higher fuel prices over 
the next five years would cancel out increases in passenger revenue, additional growth would come from its cargo 
business and other sources including BA Holidays.
Daniel Roeska, analyst at Bernstein, who attended the presentation, said: "They're putting a lot of emphasis on 
reminding everybody of the core investment of IAG and that the group is valued very cheaply against other equities 
out there. It's good progress in a challenging operating environment."
Shares in IAG were up by 2.8 per cent to 635p at lunchtime yesterday. The increase came a day after two credit 
rating agencies gave IAG investment-grade ratings for the first time.
IAG's presentation said it was "significantly undervalued relative to peers".
IAG's shares trade at 6.1 times next year's earnings, according to the Capital IQ data service, which is between that 
of its legacy carrier rivals Air France-KLM on 6.3 times and Lufthansa 4.6 times.
But this is far behind low-cost carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair, both above 10 times.
IAG raises forecasts and says it is 'significantly undervalued'
As part of its five-year plan, IAG will increase its annual capital expenditure from an average of (EURO)2.1bn to 
(EURO)2.6bn for 2019-23 period with most of the money going on new aircraft.
The group will expand its fleet from 549 last year to 716 in 2023, which includes more than 100 new short-haul 
planes, switching out of Airbus A320s into using the A320neo, and more than 50 long-haul craft.
It will also roll out Wi-Fi, upgrade lounges and invest more in IT. In September, BA announced that its website and 
app had been hacked, initially saying that 380,000 people's data had been taken but in October it increased that by 
185,000.
In its third-quarter results last week, IAG, which also owns Ireland's Aer Lingus and Spain's Iberia, reported a small 
fall in pre-tax profit.

Michael O'Leary's commitment to union representation has looked less convincing of late.
The Ryanair boss, who said last year he had reluctantly come to accept unionisation despite previously saying "hell 
would freeze over" before he did so, appears not to have entirely abandoned his old position, judging by the airline's 
actions in Poland.
The low-cost carrier is refusing to recognise the new Polish union for cabin crew and is asking them and pilots to 
sign up to the company's local subsidiary as contractors, in effect turning them into precarious workers without 
permanent employee rights.
The move comes against a background of acrimonious labour struggles at the airline, with summer strikes including 
five days by Irish pilots and two days of co-ordinated pan-European action by cabin crew.
Even though Poland is only a small part of the Ryanair operation, some industry figures fear the airline could try to 
extend the strategy elsewhere to circumvent the unions.
Jeremy Anderson at the International Transport Workers' Federation, said the contracts were "very clearly at odds 
with the direction that Ryanair claims it's been taking, which is to fundamentally recognise unions".

contractors and refuses to recognise union
He added "this looks like they are trying to union-bust" given that the company introduced the contracts around the 
same time as Ryanair's Polish cabin crew established a union, CWR.
Ryanair announced in September it was closing its bases in Poland as of 2019 and said pilots and cabin crew could 
apply for jobs as self-employed contractors of Ryanair Sun, the airline's subsidiary in the country.
Those who wanted to work for Ryanair Sun had to sign service agreements with Warsaw Aviation, which acts as an 
employment agency and "directs people to provide services to Ryanair Sun", according to a pilot's contract seen by 
the Financial Times.
Michal Kaczmarzyk, chief executive of Ryanair Sun, is listed on the agreement as a member of the management 
board of Warsaw Aviation, which is entirely owned by Ryanair Sun and shares an address with it.
The contract says Warsaw Aviation guarantees 30 hours' employment a month, but can also "cancel or modify" 
pilots' schedules with a day's notice.
While it will give pilots three weeks' notice of their schedules, "the notice period may vary at Warsaw Aviation's 
discretion".
One Poland-based pilot said the new contracts, with their apparent transfer of liability to pilots in certain 
circumstances, had soured his view of Ryanair.
"I'm looking to get out of the company. I need to be more secure," he said.
Ryanair has been engaged in negotiations with its unions since agreeing to recognise them in late 2017 after a 
rostering failure and staff shortage led to thousands of cancellations.
Paulo Conceicao, secretary of the new CWR union in Poland, which represents about 300 of the 400 Ryanair cabin 
crew in the country, said that the situation was taking a heavy toll on staff. "Psychologically, it's a huge impact. 
People are under stress. We're talking about people with two children, with mortgages and so on. People don't 
sleep at night, they have problems, they're afraid of losing their jobs," he said.
Under Polish law, self-employed workers cannot join a union, and Mr Conceicao said that cabin crew saw this as 
one of Ryanair's motivating factors. "Obviously this leaves the worker stripped from all their social rights, stripped 
from any possibility of representation and so on. It's basically creating precarious work conditions." He said that 
CWR had not ruled out strikes, but that the process of arranging industrial action in Poland was slow.
Philip von Schöppenthau of the European Cockpit Association said Ryanair's move was "a concerning example" of 
"bogus self-employment".
In a statement responding to detailed questions from the Financial Times, Ryanair said: "Ryanair has offered its 
cabin crew based in Poland transfer opportunities in Ryanair's UK and German bases, with no change to 
employment contracts of these cabin crew.
"Ryanair Sun continues to expand its Polish flights in winter 2018. It is actively recruiting pilots and cabin crew, both 
in the Polish market and abroad, on exactly the same contracts that LOT [Poland's national airline] has been 
offering its crew over the past few years."
However, Poland's National Labour Inspectorate has recommended that people providing services to LOT through 
self-employment contracts should be employed on the same basis as people on full employment contracts at the 
company. The inspectorate was also investigating Ryanair Sun and Warsaw Aviation over the form under which 
staff were employed, an official said.
Mr von Schöppenthau said Ryanair wanted "maximum flexibility" to end pilots' contracts or not to give them flight 
hours, which amounted to the same thing, and could even "offload liability in the case of an accident".

Ryanair introduces new hand luggage rules amid competition concerns

       By dpa correspondents   LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Passengers with low-cost airline Ryanair will no longer be able 
to take a 10-kilogram piece of hand luggage on board for free under a new policy introduced on Thursday.  Under 
the new rules, passengers who want to bring anything bigger than a 'small personal bag' will be charged extra 
unless they are a priority boarding customer. 
 Priority boarding costs 6 euros (7 dollars). Customers who do not choose priority boarding will have to pay 10 
euros for an extra piece of cabin baggage.  The new policy has provoked outrage on social media, with some

The court in the southern city of Den Bosch stopped the planned forced relocations on Thursday.
Ryanair said it will appeal the decision. The Irish airline had notified the pilots of the relocations on October 1 
because its site in the city of Eindhoven was being closed.
The pilots fought the decision in court, saying the forced relocations were a reaction to recent strikes.
The court agreed with their position on Thursday.

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair and its chief executive officer Michael O’Leary have been sued in New York by a 
shareholder, Reuters reports.
The City of Birmingham Firemen’s and Policemen’s Supplemental Pension System says the airline defrauded 
investors and inflated its share price by overstating its ability to manage labour relations and keep costs down.
The complaint was filed on 6 November in the US District Court in Manhattan by the Alabaman pension fund, 
seeking class-action status and damages for investors in Ryanair’s American depositary shares from 30 May 2017 
to 28 September 2018.
In a statement on 7 November, Ryanair said it will defend itself against the claims, which it called “false” and 
“doomed to fail”.
According to the complaint, Ryanair misled investors in regulatory filings and conference calls about its labour 
stability, including “industry leading” contracts with pilots and cabin crews, and its positive impact on operations.
The complaint alleges that the truth came out last December, when labour unrest forced Ryanair to recognise 
unions for the first time. The complaint also highlights this summer's costly strikes that stranded thousands of 
passengers in several countries.
“Unbeknownst to investors, the company’s historical profit growth was built on an undisclosed and unsustainable 
foundation of worker exploitation and employee turnover,” the complaint states. “The decline in the price of Ryanair 
ADSs was the direct result of the nature and extent of defendants’ fraud finally being revealed to investors and the 
market.”
Ryanair cited labour issues when it cut its full-year profit forecast on 1 October. Its share price closed that day more 
than one-third below its level in mid-March.
In the 7 November statement, Ryanair said it has experienced “very little” labour disruption from employees, and 
that most flight disruptions had resulted from air traffic control strikes and staff shortages, a problem common to 
European Union airlines.
Ryanair and CEO sued in New York court: report
O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive since 1994, said last month he hoped to reach labour agreements with all of the 
carrier’s major unions before Christmas.
On 30 June ADSs accounted for 43.7% of Ryanair’s issued ordinary shares, assuming all were converted into 
ordinary shares. Ryanair’s market value is roughly $16 billion, according to Refinitiv data cited by Reuters.
The City of Birmingham Firemen’s and Policemen’s Supplemental Pension System is represented by law firm 
Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, which specialises in securities fraud.
It is common for shareholders to sue companies in the United States after what they consider unexpected share 
price declines, Reuters says.
The case is City of Birmingham Firemen’s and Policemen’s Supplemental Pension System v Ryanair Holdings Plc, 
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-10330.

AMSTERDAM (AP) - A court in the Netherlands banned Ryanair from transferring 16 pilots overseas following the 
closure of its Dutch base in Eindhoven, saying Thursday that the move appeared to be a reprisal by the budget 
carrier for strikes by Dutch employees.
The court in Den Bosch ruled that although the pilots' contracts are based on labor laws in Ryanair's home country 
of Ireland, the carrier cannot ignore Dutch regulations.
In a statement, the court said that choosing Irish labor law "does not mean that an employer can deprive employees 
of the protection offered by Dutch law."
Ryanair had argued that closing its operations at Eindhoven Airport was a commercial decision, but the court says it 
appears to be "a sanction for earlier strikes."
In a written reaction, Ryanair said if the pilots don't transfer they will be out of a job.
"All pilots and cabin crew have already been offered base transfers, which protects their seniority and earnings, but 
if any crew members wish to choose redundancies over base transfers then we will respect that choice," the 
company said.

A Dutch court blocked Ryanair on Thursday in its attempt to shut its base in the Netherlands and move crew 
elsewhere, saying the Irish low-cost carrier had abused its powers as an employer.
Ryanair said last month it would shut its base in Eindhoven on Nov. 5, moving 16 pilots who operate flights from the 
southern Dutch airport to locations abroad in order to cut costs.
The district court in 's-Hertogenbosch said Ryanair had failed to explain why the move was necessary and said the 
decision seemed to be retaliation for the European-wide strikes Dutch pilots had joined in recent months.
Ryanair could not immediately be reached for comment.
Europe’s largest budget airline has struggled with labor relations since it bowed to pressure to recognize trade 
unions for the first time last December.
Two coordinated walkouts since August in Portugal, Germany, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands hit passenger 
numbers, bookings and profits, the company said on Oct. 1.
The court said pilots operating from Eindhoven could not be moved abroad against their will, and forced Ryanair to 
adhere to Dutch labor laws. (Reuters)

of its financial year, blaming 'widespread damage' from the strikes, among other things.  Ryanair also came under 
heavy criticism last month for its lacklustre response to a passenger who launched a racist rant at the woman sitting 
next to him, after a video showing the incident was circulated on social media.   Copyright dpa

Laudamotion, the Austrian airline that is part of the Ryanair Group, has agreed to lease two Airbus A320s from 
SMBC Aviation Capital.
The first aircraft was delivered to Laudamotion this week with the second aircraft due in January 2019.
This is the first aircraft delivered on lease to Laudamotion since the completion of Ryanair’s increased investment in 
the airline at the end of August. In all, Ryanair expects to double the existing Laudamotion fleet to 19. Ryanair 
initially purchased 24.9% of Laudamotion earlier this year and increased its shareholding to 75% during summer 
2018 following approval from the EU Competition Authority.

French bailiffs seized a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 aircraft last week in a bid to recover subsidies paid to the airline 
that the European Commission later deemed illegal.
According to the The Local, Ryanair has now repaid the &euro;525,000 ($590,000) that French authorities 
demanded for the return of its aircraft.
The sum concerned a subsidy scheme for Ryanair flights from Angoul&ecirc;me regional airport between 2008 and 
2009, the BBC reports.
The authorities impounded the aircraft on 8 November at Charente airport, forcing 149 passengers to disembark.

Baggage handlers and the firm Aviapartner have reached a deal to end a strike that had disrupted operations at 
Brussels Airport, allowing normal operations to resume, the airport announced Wednesday.
"Aviapartner will gradually resume activities as of this afternoon, which will allow for a return to normal operations 
for the flights handled by Aviapartner," the airport said on its web site.
The airport added it "deplores the major impact this unannounced strike has had on passengers and airlines," 
noting that 960 flights were cancelled and almost 115,000 travellers were affected over the six-day strike.
The work stoppage came at a busy travel time in Belgium, when many schools have a term break.
Aviapartner workers had cited grievances over low wages, understaffing and a bonus that was promised but not 
fully paid, according to the news agency Belga.
Under the deal, Aviapartner will cut workloads, invest in more equipment amounting to 3.2 million euros (3.6 million 
dollars), approve new bonuses and monitor the implementation of these proposals, Belga reported, citing union 
officials.
The agreement would also see more workers hired and have more workers employed under contracts.
Aviapartner, which handles Brussels baggage for Ryanair, EasyJet, British Airways and TUI Fly, is contracted in 37 
airports in six European countries, according to its website.

Gate huggers: should airports look to deploy more retail at boarding areas?
Gate huggers: should airports look to deploy more retail at boarding areas?

Highlight: Many airports worldwide are taking big steps to appease passengers' inner shopper. Aviation hubs such 
as London Heathrow, Singapore Changi and Hong Kong International now offer a staggering array of retail, food 
and beverage options.
Body
A report published last year by Airports Council International revealed that non-aeronautical cash sources continued 
to constitute 40% of global airport revenues and had reached an industry value of $60.4bn.However, some airports 
are beginning to recognise a frustrating passenger demographic the media likes to call ‘gate huggers’: lounge-shy 
travellers who tend to walk straight to their boarding gate rather than explore the retail playground of the departure 
lounge.On the face of it, passengers that refuse to be swayed by duty-free mega-zones present a potential loss for 
airports and retailers. But could they provide an incentive for new retail opportunities at boarding gates?The causes 
of gate huggingThe ‘gate hugging’ trend can be put down to a number of different factors, says Chris van 
R&yuml;sw&yuml;ck, associate director of Pragma Consulting and a former commercial performance manager at 
London Gatwick Airport. At the top of his list are nervous fliers, who may be concerned about missing their flight 
and therefore tend to hover near gates.The rise of low-cost-carriers (LCCs), such as Ryanair, could also amplify 
these concerns. As LCCs often lock aircraft hold space behind a paywall, many passengers only carry hand 
baggage and know that arriving late could result in their bags being stowed in the hold.Other passengers may 
simply lack an interest in airport retail or want to get away from the hustle and bustle of departure lounges. 
This, Van R&yuml;sw&yuml;ck says, is something many modern-day airport departure lounges don’t always 
accommodate for.“Many airports provide very limited passenger seating and passengers who want to sit down 
know there are seats at the gate rooms,” he says.David Lenot, airport practice leader at video surveillance 
specialist Genetec, says delays at security can cripple a passenger’s desire to shop. However, he also says that 
gate hugging might be a side effect of cultural differences.“You may have people come from specific countries 
where people would be more prone not to use retail or simply have a habit of sticking closer to the gate earlier,” he 
says.A US-led phenomenonIndeed, when it comes to airports, Van R&yuml;sw&yuml;ck says that there is a 
massive cultural difference between the US and the rest of the world. Gate hugging could be more of a US 
phenomenon due to the way those airports are structured.Most airports worldwide feature a separate holding

lounge where passengers can shop before they are called to the gate, where retail offers are usually more limited. 
However in the US, many airports – aside from the few that have been privatised – consist of a ‘processing head-
house’ owned by a port authority, followed by concourses which are airline-owned.Because airlines manage these 
post-security zones, passengers know roughly where their gate will be from the outset and are therefore more 
inclined to move into those areas sooner. Van R&yuml;sw&yuml;ck says that this could be a reason why boarding 
gates at US airports feature a stronger retail offering.“Because [the processing head house] is a port authority-run 
service, they are not looking to overly commercialise it,” he explains. “They get some income from it, but it’s not a 
main focus, just as the British Airport Authority airports back in the early 80s and 70s were government-owned and 
not pleasant places to be.”Bringing dining options to the gateAirports in the US have already begun finding ways to 
accommodate ‘gate huggers’, while combining it with another trend not exclusive to airports – the modern-day 
individual’s overwhelming desire to look at screens.One concept being explored is a ‘mobile retail cart’, which could 
be parked at certain gates and offer products tailored to passengers based on their destination. Meanwhile, 
customers at JFK International, Washington National and Newark Liberty are able to order food from a suite of 
iPads set up near boarding gates.Start-ups have taken the latter idea and are running with it. The Airport Sherpa 
app allows passengers at Baltimore Washington International to order food or duty-free items from their phones. 
Goods can be picked up from shops or delivered anywhere in the airport – including at the gate. The app even 
tracks passengers’ flight schedule, ensuring that deliveries can go ahead even in the event of a gate change.“Gate 
hugging is a very natural thing to do – I do it,” says Airport Sherpa co-founder Mayank Gandhi. “I don’t want to miss 
my flight or miss the opportunity to store my carry-on in the overhead bin before it runs out of space. But that 
shouldn’t mean I have to settle for what’s next to my gate.”Airport Sherpa’s CEO Patrick DellaValle says the app 
allows passengers to access duty-free and food offerings they might not otherwise have access to – if it’s in a 
different terminal, for example – thus improving the scope of an airport’s retail investment.The app is set to launch 
at a number of US airports in the future, but DellaValle also thinks the idea could have appeal at airports 
abroad.“When we talk with airport partners in Europe they still see the same value proposition,” he says. “Certainly 
there are going to be aspects which are a bit different, but when they run their analysis of what their customers want 
from an experience standpoint – alongside the key drivers that they see as being able to increase overall revenue – 
our service offering fits exactly what they are looking for.”Finding the ‘critical mass’PQ: Retailers need to consider 
whether they will have the ‘critical mass’ required to make their operational costs worthwhileUS airports may be 
taking steps to monetise gate rooms, but should airports elsewhere take the plunge?Lenot says the first step should 
be finding out whether passengers are actually dwelling for too long at the gate. Nowadays, airports can use a 
variety of technologies to understand the movement and behaviour of passengers through terminals, giving them 
key performance indicators that they can then apply to their retail strategies. Genetec’s Airport Sense solution, for 
example, uses cameras and sensors to provide actionable intelligence about passenger flow through terminals.“If 
you could use CCTV cameras or any other measuring technology, you would be able to assess the dwell time of 
people in the seating area next to the gate, so that’s a good indicator,” says Lenot.Van R&yuml;sw&yuml;ck says 
airports would have to be careful when they consider offering a larger retail offer at gate rooms, as it could 
‘cannibalise’ the revenues from their existing retail mega-hubs.Whether retailers are setting up shop on the high 
street or at airports, they need to consider whether they will have the ‘critical mass’ required to make their 
operational costs worthwhile. Ultimately, airports that operate a call-to-gate strategy might not be able to guarantee 
this – particularly if the overwhelming majority of consumers pick up items in the departure lounge.“If I’m a 
concessionaire looking to buy space and the airport says, ‘I’ve got this great location, but only 3% of our 
passengers per annum go to that particular gate room’, my critical mass for being able to service that location is 
suddenly tremendously diminished,” Van R&yuml;sw&yuml;ck says.“I would give the gate huggers a reason not to 
hug the gate. If people want a quiet area, then provide a quiet area. If people are nervous, communicate your way-
finding more effectively and make people comfortable that they aren’t going to miss their flights so they are happy to 
stay in that commercial environment.“That to me is not only an easier solution, but also one that I think would 
deliver better returns.”

Baggage handlers and management are close to reaching an agreement that would end a strike that has disrupted 
operations at Brussels Airport, the news service Belga reported Wednesday.
The strike by employees of the services company Aviapartner, which started last Thursday, cited grievances over 
low wages, understaffing and a bonus that was promised but not fully paid.
According to union officials, strikers will review the deal at 11 am (1000 GMT), at which point some people would 
return to work, Belga reported. The deal includes bonuses and an increase in the number of contract positions.
The strike resulted in scores of flight cancellations each day and came at a busy travel time in Belgium, when many 
schools have a term break.
Aviapartner, which handles Brussels baggage for Ryanair, EasyJet, British Airways and TUI Fly, is contracted in 37 
airports in six European countries, according to its website.

Ryanair shareholder calls for chairman's ouster
Ryanair shareholder calls for chairman's ouster

Britain's Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), which represents funds that own a combined 
1% of Ryanair, on Sunday said it planned to file resolutions at the company's next annual general meeting to 
replace Chairman David Bonderman.
The group, which opposed Bonderman's re-election at last month's AGM, said it would lobby fellow shareholders to 
join it to secure the 3% of shares required to file a shareholder resolution at the next meeting, due in September 
2019.
The group also plans to file a resolution demanding that succession plans for Chief Executive Michael O'Leary be 
set out.
"On the day of Ryanair's first-half results (Oct. 22) Mr O'Leary said Mr Bonderman intends to remain in place for 
one or two more years and that the company would set out succession plans for Mr O'Leary in the next two or three 
years," the LAPFF said in a statement.
"Shareholders have made it clear they expect action quicker than this."
The group said it believed recent staffing and industrial relations issues at Ryanair might have been handled better 
with a more independent board.
It said its concerns had been heightened by a profit warning on Oct. 1. when Ryanair cut its forecast for full-year 
profit by 12% citing damage to bookings from strikes.
Ryanair shareholder calls for chairman's ouster
The LAPFF was one of several shareholders to voice concerns at Ryanair's AGM in September, when Bonderman, 
was re-elected with 70.5% of votes, a significant fall from the 89% he received the previous year.
"Ryanair shareholders recently passed all AGM resolutions by a large majority, including the nomination of directors 
and chairman," a Ryanair spokesman said when asked to comment on the LAPFF's plan.
"They appreciate how fortunate we are to have an outstanding Chairman like David Bonderman guide the board 
and the airline."
Bonderman, the founder of private equity firm TPG Capital who has chaired Ryanair since 1996, resigned from the 
board of Uber in 2017 after an ill-judged joke that more women on the board means "more talking". (Reuters)

Companies Rule Out Interest in Alitalia, in Blow to Rescue Plan
Companies Rule Out Interest in Alitalia, in Blow to Rescue Plan

Oct 30, 2018( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  Major companies on Tuesday 
ruled out involvement in a new rescue of Alitalia, complicating a plan led by Rome in which state-controlled railway 
Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) will bid for the airline this week and bring in partners. Alitalia was put under special 
administration last year, leaving the government once again looking to find a buyer to save the carrier. 
It will be the airline's third rescue in a decade. FS is due to present an offer for the whole of Alitalia on Wednesday 
subject to a series of conditions. FS's offer would only be a "transitional phase," a source close to the deal told 
Reuters. The source added the deal would be completed in two separate steps, with FS picking up Alitalia on set 
conditions and then, at a later stage, being joined by an Italian partner and a international one, from the airline 
sector. The source added there was very little visibility on next steps, and it was not clear which partners would join 
FS. "The situation is very messy," the source said. Earlier this month Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio 
suggested that state-controlled companies like oil major Eni , postal operator Poste and defense group Leonardo 
could all play a role in the relaunch. Di Maio, also industry minister, said that there were many private investors also 
interested in Alitalia. But on Tuesday Eni said that any suggestion that it might pick up a stake in the carrier was 
"groundless" and that it would not play a role in the rescue, a spokesperson said. Leonardo too will not join any 
relaunch of Alitalia, which has already accumulated a loss of over 300 million euros ($340.86 million), a separate 
source close to the matter told Reuters. "It would be crazy for Leonardo to enter this madness," the source said. 
Shares in the group were down almost 1.5 percent at 1600 GMT after Italian dailies had reported that the company 
would be involved in an effort spearheaded by FS. Last month Poste Chief Executive Matteo del Fante said the 
group was "not at all interested" in joining an overhaul effort for the airline. Cash drain Alitalia has cost Italian tax 
payers almost 10 billion euros over the last 20 years, more than the market capitalization of Air France-KLM, 
Turkish Airlines, Norwegian Air, Finnair and SAS added together, according to Andrea Giuricin, CEO of transport 
advisory firm TRA Consulting. Last year Alitalia accounted for only 8.5 percent of the international traffic to and from 
Italy, Giuricin added, just under a third of Ryanair's share. The sale process was delayed due to the change of 
Italian government earlier this year, but the ruling coalition, that comprises the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement 
and the far-right League, pledged it would close a deal by Wednesday. Germany's Lufthansa said earlier on 
Tuesday that it had no interest in participating in a government-led restructuring effort. Alitalia must pay back the 
Italian state almost 1 billion euros in a bridge loan and related interest by mid-December. ($1 = 0.8801 euros)

BRUSSELS (AP) - A strike by baggage handlers is disrupting flights to and from Belgium's main airport for a fifth 
day.
Workers at the Aviapartner luggage handling company are striking to back their demands for better working 
conditions. The company serves major companies like Ryanair, TUI, EasyJet and British Airways.
Dozens of flights to and from Brussels Airport were canceled Monday as union representatives and management 
continue negotiations.
The work stoppage left passengers wondering how they would reach their destinations.
Jason Glassy, who was supposed to be flying to Barcelona, says, "I am just waiting in the line to see what the 
alternative is, I am not too sure."

Brussels Airport continues to struggle with a strike by baggage handlers, cancelling a further 100 flights on Monday, 
according to the news agency Belga.
The strike by employees of the services company Aviapartner started on Thursday evening. After a pause, 
Aviapartner's management and the unions resumed talks Monday morning. But the two sides remain far apart.
The strike comes at a busy travel time. Many schools across Belgium have a term break this week to coincide with 
the All Saints' holiday on Thursday.
About 350,000 people were expected to travel via Brussels Airport during this period, according to Belga.
Among the list of strikers' grievances are low wages, understaffing and a bonus that was promised but not fully 
paid. A trade union statement cited "a total absence of social consultation" within the company, Belga reported.
Aviapartner, which handles Brussels baggage for Ryanair, EasyJet, British Airways and TUI Fly, is contracted in 37 
airports in six European countries, according to its website.

Russian budget airline Pobeda is committing to acquiring 20 Boeing 737 Max 8s, with an option to convert some to 
the high-density ‘Max 200’ variant.
It is to take 15 of the aircraft from lessor SMBC Aviation Capital and another five from GECAS, it states in a formal 
procurement notice.
Pobeda’s aircraft from SMBC will come with a conversion option to switch seven of them to the ‘Max 200’ 
configuration.
This version has 197 seats, compared with the normal 189, and has already been ordered by budget carriers 
Ryanair and VietJet.
The five GECAS aircraft will all be regular Max 8s, the airline’s notice indicates.
Pobeda puts the value of the SMBC batch at $1.235 billion and that of the GECAS aircraft at $375 million.
The aircraft are all exclusively powered by CFM International Leap-1B engines.
Moscow Vnukovo-based Pobeda is already a Boeing 737-800 operator but had recently signalled that it was looking 
at the re-engined Max variant during a recruitment drive for pilots.
Pobeda estimates that the delivery of the SMBC aircraft will begin in November 2019 and run to November 2021, 
while that of the GECAS jets will take place in the first half of 2020.

RYANAIR shareholder the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) yesterday called for the replacement of 
the budget airline's chairman David Bonderman and for a succession plan for its boss Michael O'Leary.
LAPFF said it plans to file resolutions at Ryanair's annual meeting (AGM) next year to replace Bonderman who has 
been in the post for 22 years. The UK's corporate governance code says that a chair should serve for no longer 
than nine years.
It also called for the company to layout a succession plan for longstanding chief executive Michael O'Leary in the 
next two to three years.
LAPFF said that Bonderman "presides over a board that is not sufficiently independent" and said he has been 
"unsuccessful in his oversight of employment issues at the company and ensuring customers receive adequate 
service during flight cancellations in summer 2018".
A Ryanair spokesperson said: "Ryanair shareholders recently passed all AGM resolutions by a large majority, 
including the nomination of directors and chairman. They appreciate how fortunate we are to have an outstanding 
chairman like David Bonderman guide the board and the airline."

Low-cost carrier Ryanair has issued a statement to clarify its response to an incident in which a woman was racially 
abused on one of its flights, and accused the daughter of the victim of making an "untrue" claim about whether the 
airline made an apology.
Ryanair also implied its cabin crew had not understood the seriousness of the incident as passengers boarded a 
flight from Barcelona to Stansted on Friday October 19.
In a statement, Ryanair said it "immediately wrote ... to the female passenger at 11am on Sunday [October 21], 
apologising for what happened on board the aircraft ... We also invited the passenger to contact the airline if they 
wished to discuss the matter. The claim made in the media in recent days, that Ryanair did not contact or apologise 
to the female passenger, is untrue."
Carol Gayle, daughter of victim Delsie Gayle, said after the incident: "Nobody has apologised. We've had nothing. 
We just want an apology from Ryanair."
However, yesterday Ryanair made public copies of a letter and an email that it said had been sent last Sunday to 
Ms Gayle: "On behalf of Ryanair, may I sincerely apologise for what happened on board our aircraft," the letter said.
Ryanair rejects claim it did not apologise to racial abuse victim News round-up
Ryanair said it only became aware of a video of the incident - in which a man identified as David Mesher racially 
abused Mrs Gayle - late on Saturday, October 20. The airline said it reported the incident to police the next 
morning.
Mr Mesher said yesterday he was "not a racist" and apologised, saying he had just had a "fit of temper".
The airline said that Spanish cabin crew were aware of an argument between the two passengers during the 
boarding process, "but were not aware of, as they were not present, racist comments that were made".
Robin Kiely, head of communications at Ryanair, said the airline had "treated [the incident] with the urgency and 
seriousness it warranted".
"We trust that this statement will address the inaccurate media coverage of this incident over recent days."

If the oil price rises, or if average fares fall further, morecapacity cuts look likely for thebudgetcarrier It was a 
turbulent firsthalf for Ryanair following ongoing pilot disputes and air traffic controller strikes in continental Europe. 
In early October, management warned pre-tax profits would land between (EURO)1.1bn (£97m) and (EURO)1.2bn-
a12 per cent downgrade on expectations .
investor.s were pleasantly surprised, then, that this figure actually came to (EURO)1.3bn, with the shares up about 
5 per cent on results day. Passenger numbers increased by 6 per cent to 76.6m, with load factor maintained at 96 
per cent, although the average fare fell 3 per cent to under (EURO)46.
Improvements in ancillary revenue, up nearly a third during the period to (EURO)1.3bn, were offset bcmad by 
higher fuel, staff and compensation costs. Although more than 100 new routes were added to the summer 2018 
season, weaker fares and higher oil prices forced the airline to trim winter capacity by 1 per cent. Even so, 
management still expects traffic numbers to increase to around 141m by the end of the financial year, boosted by 
Ryanair's 75 per cent stake in Austrian airline Laudamotion.
Analysts at UBS expect earnings per share of 970 cents during the year to March 2019, compared with 1,200 cents 
in full-year 2018.
While higher fuel prices added to first-half costs, 90 per cent of Ryanair's fuel needs for the next 12 months." are 
hedged at $68 per barrel-well below the $85 spot price. Still, we are wary of recent volatility to turn bullish just yet, 
especially when the shares look expensive compared with their historical two-year trading average and the wider 
sector. Julia Faurschou

Ryanair seeks to deflect criticism of racist incident

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair sought to deflect criticism Friday about its handling of a racially charged dispute on one of 
its flights by releasing letters showing that it swiftly apologized to the victim and referred the matter to police.
Europe's biggest discount carrier said in letters to victim that it "will not tolerate unruly behavior" and that the matter 
had been reported to police at London's Stansted Airport. The incident took place Friday at Barcelona Airport before 
the plane departed for Stansted, and British police are expected to hand over the results of their inquiry to Spanish 
authorities.
The move came as the man who directed racial slurs at a fellow passenger denied being a racist and apologized to 
the woman he berated. David Mesher told Britain's ITV News that the dispute with 77-year-old Delsie Gayle began 
as he tried to get to his seat.
"I probably lost my temper a bit and ordered her to get up," he said, adding that he "absolutely" regrets his behavior. 
"I'm not a racist person by any means and it's just a fit of temper at the time, I think."
The interview is the first time Mesher has spoken publicly about the incident, in which he told Gayle, among other 
things, not to speak to him "in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow." He told ITV he had spoken to police in 
Birmingham, where he lives.
The ramifications of the incident continued to simmer as some passengers have called for a boycott of Ryanair 
because the victim was moved to another seat and the airline didn't remove Mesher from the plane.
Ryanair said it wanted to set the record straight on its response to the incident, reporting that crew members were 
aware of an argument but only learned of the racist nature of the comments after being shown the video upon 
landing at Stansted.
"As the cabin crew believed they were dealing with an argument between two passengers, they followed company 
procedure, to defuse the argument, and separate the passengers by offering to move one to alternative seating," 
Ryanair said in a statement.
Ryanair seeks to deflect criticism of racist incident
The female passenger was moved at her request to a seat next to her daughter, Ryanair said. Both passengers 
then said they were "okay."
"As far as the cabin crew were concerned, that was the end of the matter, and since there was no threat to aircraft 
safety, the issue of offloading one passenger did not arise," the airline said.
Loizos Heracleous, an expert on airlines at the Warwick Business School, said the statement showed that Ryanair 
realized it had to condemn this sort of behavior in any situation, including their own flights.
"Service excellence is not Ryanair's forte (efficiency is)," Heracleous said in an email. "With that focus, 
unfortunately the company and, in this case the crew, may not be as sensitized to instances of abusive behavior as 
they should be and may not take the right actions immediately when it occurs. Hopefully Ryanair will realize from 
the strength of the public response that they should up their game in this area."

A baggage-handler strike at Brussels Airport has caused at least 150 flights to be cancelled or rerouted and left 
hundreds of travellers stranded at the airport overnight, the Belga news service reported on Friday.
The strike began on Thursday evening to protest working conditions at Aviapartner, a services firm. It will last until 6 
am Sunday (0500 GMT), according to the airport's website.
According to union representatives, the two sides are still "very far apart" on any agreement, and talks are on hold, 
Belga reported.
Among the list of strikers' grievances are low wages, understaffing and a bonus that was promised but not fully 
paid. A trade union statement cited "a total absence of social consultation" within the company, Belga reported.
Aviapartner, which handles Brussels baggage for Ryanair, EasyJet, British Airways and TUI Fly, is contracted in 37 
airports in six European countries, according to its website.
The strike comes at a busy travel time ahead of the All Saints' holiday next week, when many schools across 
Belgium have a term break. About 350,000 people are expected to travel via Brussels Airport during this period, 
according to Belga.

The European Commission has started an investigation into whether the company operating a German regional 
airport violated EU rules on state aid in its treatment of Ryanair.
At issue is Germany's Frankfurt-Hahn airport, located in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. From 2009 to 2017, the 
state controlled the firm managing the airport, Flughafengesellschaft Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH (FFHG). The HNA 
Group purchased 82.5 per cent of FFHG in 2017.
Brussels opened an investigation after receiving a complaint that the airport was giving favourable treatment to the 
budget carrier Ryanair, the commission said Friday in a statement.
The probe will look at agreements between Ryanair and the state prior to 2009, and between Ryanair and FFHG 
after 2009, to see if the carrier received preferential treatment.
The post-2009 agreements under review include deals covering airport service agreements, training aid to Ryanair 
and other projects.
The commission will also investigate whether certain land sale agreements between the state and FFHG ran afoul 
of EU competition rules.
Under these rules, states may provide assistance to regional airports if it helps local development, connectivity and 
traffic decongestion. This aid may include subsidies to budget airlines.
Publically owned airports, however, cannot extend incentives that exceed what a profit-driven airport operator would 
offer under the same conditions.

The commission has already concluded numerous other probes into airports and state aid, including cases in 
France, Germany, Austria, and Italy - all of which found instances of EU state aid violations.

A baggage-handler strike at Brussels Airport has caused 42 flights to be cancelled, and left hundreds of travellers 
stranded at the airport overnight, the Belga news service reported on Friday.
The strike began on Thursday evening to protest working conditions at Aviapartner, a services firm. No details were 
immediately available on how long it will last.
Aviapartner, which handles Brussels baggage for Ryanair, EasyJet, British Airways and TUI Fly, is contracted in 37 
airports in six European countries, according to its website.
A statement by the trade union cited "a total absence of social consultation" within the company, Belga reported.
The strike comes at a busy travel time ahead of the All Saints' holiday next week, when many schools across 
Belgium have a term break. About 350,000 people are expected to travel via Brussels Airport, according to Belga.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K stocks fell sharply on Friday, tracking steep declines across 
Europe and a plunge in U.S. stock futures as Amazon and Alphabet both disappointed with their third-quarter 
earnings after the U.S. closing bell. Earnings of domestic firms also proved to be a mixed bag.   The benchmark 
FTSE 100 was down 123 points or 1.77 percent at 6,879 in late opening deals after closing 0.6 percent higher in the 
previous session.   Royal Bank of Scotland tumbled 4.3 percent as it warned of uncertain economic outlook after 
reporting lower-than-expected profit for the third quarter.  Glencore dropped 2 percent after lowering its oil 
production guidance. Anglo American declined 1.7 percent and Antofagasta fell over 1 percent.   Oil major Tullow 
Oil plunged 5.4 percent and BP Plc gave up 3.6 percent as oil remained on track to post a third weekly loss.  British 
Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group jumped 3 percent as it reported strong third-quarter 
trading results despite rising costs.   Ryanair Holdings inched up 0.2 percent after signing collective labor 
agreements with two Belgian Unions.

The European Commission said on Friday it had opened an in-depth investigation into marketing and financial 
deals between low cost carrier Ryanair and Frankfurt-Hahn airport in Germany to assess whether it constituted 
illegal state aid.
"We will investigate whether regional and local authorities in Germany, against the rules, gave an unfair advantage 
to Ryanair over its competitors," EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
Under the deal, Ryanair received between 2009 and 2017 training aid and funding for a crew and pilot school and 
for a maintenance hall, the Commission said.
The EU executive opened a similar investigation in July over a deal between Ryanair and the French airport of 
Montpellier
The Commission said it will also investigate possible state aid to the airport operator Flughafengesellschaft 
Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH (FFHG), which between 2009 and 2017 was controlled by the German state of Rhineland-
Palatinate. (Reuters)

       BRUSSELS (dpa-AFX) - The European Commission said it has opened an in-depth investigation to assess 
whether measures in favour of Ryanair at the German airport of Frankfurt-Hahn are in line with State aid rules. The 
Commission will also investigate certain measures in favour of the airport operator FFHG.  Frankfurt-Hahn airport is 
a regional airport located in the German State of Rhineland-Palatinate, approximately 120 km west of Frankfurt am 
Main. It handles around 2.5 million passengers per year, as well as significant freight traffic. The airport is operated 
by the company Flughafengesellschaft Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH (FFHG), which between 2009 and 2017 was 
controlled by the State of Rhineland-Palatinate. On 1 March 2017, the HNA Group purchased 82.5% of FFHG.  The 
Commission said it received a complaint concerning certain measures in favour of Ryanair with respect to its

Further developments this week in Stobart Group's loud boardroom bust-up with Andrew Tinkler, the former chief 
executive who can't quite let go. Earlier in the year, the infrastructure group ousted Tinkler from its board and said it 
would issue legal proceedings against him for "breach of fiduciary duty".
It may now be feeling a bit of firer's remorse. As part of a counterclaim for wrongful dismissal, Tinkler has 
persuaded a court to force Stobart to publish sensitive information, including internal texts and emails related to his 
defenestration. Tinkler says we will also see details of a tidy cash bonus of as much as £18m to be paid to current 
boss Warwick Brady. To date, this has not been disclosed to shareholders. The bumper payout will come to fruition 
if - among other things - Ryanair's residency from 2019 at Stobart's Southend airport takes off. Stobart, meanwhile, 
said it was happy to provide details of the bonus schemes and that it was "confident of winning the case".

 E IATA calls for Brexit backstop to avoid air connectivity 'chaos'; The UK 
and the European Union must take "urgent action" to plan for the 
continuation of air services in the event of the two parties failing to reach a 
deal on their future relationship, in the view of IATA.

The UK and the European Union must take urgent action to plan for the continuation of air services in the event of a 
"no deal" Brexit, according to IATA.
"A backstop contingency plan to keep planes flying after March must be published, and quickly," says IATA director 
general Alexandre de Juniac on 25 October, referring to the UK’s likely end-March departure from the bloc.
Even in the "best-case scenario", where a Brexit transition phase is agreed for the period after March 2019, "a high 
degree of uncertainty" and "risk" to air services remains, IATA says.
"The EU and UK have a responsibility to millions of their citizens who depend on reliable air transportation," states 
de Juniac. "The goal should be a comprehensive air services agreement that does not step backwards from the 
connectivity existing today."
Regarding a no-deal scenario, IATA cites the uninterrupted continuation of air connectivity, the safety and security 
regulatory framework, and the policies and processes needed for efficient border management as three key areas 
where it says insufficient steps have been taken.
"These are the most critical areas because there are no fallback agreements such as the WTO framework available 
in a 'no-deal' Brexit scenario," suggests de Juniac.
He continues: "Without any contingency planning being made transparent to the industry, the risks of not 
addressing these issues could mean chaos for travellers and interrupted supply chains. With less than six months 
to go, we have little more certainty than we did in June 2016."
E IATA calls for Brexit backstop to avoid air connectivity 'chaos' The UK and the European Union must take 
"urgent action" to plan for the continuation of air s....
Regarding the lack of clarity on the UK’s relationship with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) under any 
Brexit scenario, de Juniac describes as "ridiculous" the fact that formal discussions have been forbidden during 
negotiations.
"This is aviation safety we are talking about – the number one priority for everyone connected with air transport and 
the top responsibility for governments," he states.
IATA meanwhile suggests that both parties should work towards a deal where the status quo is maintained 
regarding airport security measures.
The association also urges the UK and the EU to agree a deal that does not restrict freedom of movement and 
goods, citing the complexity of the latter issue in particular thanks to a lack of clarity on future customs 
arrangements.
"Interference with the movement of people and goods will have a major and immediate knock-on impact to 
economic activity in both the UK and the EU," de Juniac says. "Solutions to minimise disruption are of paramount 
importance. We must have clarity on future border and customs arrangements now, if we are to plan for an orderly 
post-Brexit situation."
Among Europe's airline chiefs, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has been particularly vocal on the potential negative 
impacts of Brexit, in March describing the UK's decision to leave the EU as "the stupidest idea known to humankind 
– the first time in history people have voted to get poorer or be less well off", and warning on the potential for it to 
impact air connectivity.
Also speaking in March, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways and Iberia parent IAG, took a more 
optimistic view on Brexit. "I'm a firm believer that this will get resolved" he stated. "There’s no better industry at 
dealing with disruption than ours, [and] there's not a lot that needs to be sorted out."

Stobart Group's pre-tax loss worsened by almost half to £17.5m in the six months to the end of August, capping a 
difficult period featuring an acrimonious boardroom battle and a shareholder revolt against the chairman.
Warwick Brady, chief executive of the infrastructure mini-conglomerate that owns Southend airport, yesterday 
hailed "strong commercial progress" in both aviation and energy and added that the campaign against the chairman 
by founder Andrew Tinkler was "a lot of noise, which is annoying, but we're not going to let the noise of the founder 
distract us from driving this business forward".
Revenue at Stobart increased 21 per cent to £151m in the six months. However, this included £15.7m from its 
Flybe franchise aviation operation, which is ending after rivals easyJet and Ryanair agreed to expand their rosters 
at Southend.
Ryanair will be basing three aircraft at London Southend from 2019, representing an investment of $300m and 
more than 55 flights a week. Mr Brady said the commercial terms of the deal with Ryanair reflected "the scarcity of 
peak slots. Ryanair get more aeroplanes in London and we're going to get a huge amount of footfall through that 
airport."
Stobart's rail and civil engineering division swung from a £900,000 profit in 2017 to a £6m loss this year after 
downgrading the recorded performance of existing contracts. The unit's financial director was also replaced.
Stobart difficulties worsen with wider losses Transport
Nick Dilworth, chief operating officer, said the rail management team had undertaken "a deep dive" into its 
contracts: "The way in which we've taken a prudent view [is] to recognise any suggested losses immediately and 
effectively defer any positive variances." He said he expected that position to recover.
The company's net debt more than doubled from £36.6m to £75.6m between February and August.
Stobart shares fell as much as 8 per cent yesterday before recovering to close 1.4 per cent higher at 218p.
The group's troubles became public earlier this year when former chief executive Mr Tinkler launched a campaign 
to unseat chairman Iain Ferguson and replace him with retail entrepreneur Philip Day.

STOBART reported a £17.5m loss yesterday but was optimistic about its future growth amid a bitter courtroom 
battle with former chief executive Andrew Tinkler.
The Southend Airport owner's halfyearly results showed the loss included an £18m investment, which helped 
secure a five-year deal with Ryanair.
Chief executive Warwick Brady said the deal, for three Ryanair aircraft to be based at the airport from next summer, 
would bring an additional one million passengers each year.
Brady said it had been a "difficult time" for the company in recent months, in which Tinkler was fired from the board 
following an alleged conspiracy to topple chairman Iain Ferguson.
The company's revenue grew 21 per cent to £151m for the six months to 31 August.
Shares initially dropped nine per cent before recovering those losses.
The boardroom battle will spill over into the courtroom next month after the company and Tinkler traded lawsuits 
over the dismissal.
In a pre-trial hearing this week, the court heard that Tinkler raised "difficult questions" regarding Stobart's deal with 
Ryanair, just days before being fired from the board.
Stobart claims Tinkler led a conspiracy against the company in an unsuccessful attempt to topple the chairman in 
July.
Stobart lands loss as courtroom showdown nears
Tinkler had supported The Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day for the role, but he was narrowly defeated in a 
shareholders' vote.
Stobart claimed that Tinkler had made decisions regarding the failed takeover of Flybe to "enrich himself".
Tinkler denied all the allegations.

CNE-CSC and LBC-NVK to cover all of Ryanair's directly employed pilots and cabin crew in Belgium.
Body
Belgian Labour Law will apply to all Ryanair pilots and cabin crew in Belgium no later than 31st January 2019.This 
follows similar agreements signed over the past week with pilot unions SEPLA in Spain, SPAC in Portugal and 
BALPA in the UK, covering all of Ryanair’s directly employed Spanish, Portuguese and UK Pilots.Ryanair’s Chief 
People Officer, Eddie Wilson said:“We are pleased to have signed this latest CLA covering all of our directly 
employed pilots and cabin crew in Belgium. These signed union agreements in Belgium, Spain, Portugal and the 
UK again demonstrate the considerable progress we’re making in concluding union agreements with our people in 
our major EU markets.We expect that these new agreements will encourage the cabin crew unions in both Spain 
and Portugal to remove competitor airline employees (who have been blocking progress) and to quickly conclude 
cabin crew agreements in those two countries, as that’s what our Portuguese and Spanish cabin crew are now 
demanding.”

Cost of developing Flybe routes pushes Stobart Aviation to loss; Costs of 
£18 million ($23 million) incurred in developing routes under a Flybe 
franchise deal drove Stobart Group's aviation division to a £2.7 million 
operating loss in the six months ended 31 August, after a £3.6 million profit 
in the same period of 2017.

Costs of £18.1 million ($23.3 million) incurred in developing routes under a Flybe franchise deal drove Stobart 
Group's aviation division to a £2.7 million EBITDA loss in the six months ended 31 August.
This compares with a £3.6 million profit in the same period of 2017.
If the Flybe-related effects are stripped out, underlying aviation EBITDA was up 15% to £15.7 million. Total aviation 
revenue rose 16% at £103 million.
In May 2017, Stobart Air began operating for UK regional carrier Flybe from London Southend airport, which is 
owned by Stobart Group. However, the franchise operation is "being withdrawn following the agreements with 
EasyJet and Ryanair to expand their operations at [Southend]", notes the group, which earlier this year had a 
takeover offer rejected by Flybe.
Of its expenditure on development of the Flybe routes, Stobart observes: "Demonstrating route viability and building 
customer awareness was central to securing a milestone agreement with Ryanair that will allow us to accelerate the 
growth of the airport."
Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that Stobart Air operates Embraer 195 jets and ATR 72 turboprops. Stobart says it will 
end jet operations for Flybe by the end of the current financial year – which runs to 28 February – and turboprop 
flights by the end of the next one.
Cost of developing Flybe routes pushes Stobart Aviation to loss Costs of £18 million ($23 million) incurred in

The group meanwhile foresees growth of its franchise partnership with IAG-owned Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus. 
"Stobart Air will also leverage the value of its aircraft by securing additional commercial relationships with other 
airlines," it adds.
Southend airport's passenger numbers rose 37% to 839,000 in the first half, says Stobart, noting that EBITDA per 
passenger rose from £1.74 to £3.26.
The group expects that EasyJet passenger numbers from Southend will exceed one million in 2018 following the 
UK low-cost carrier's decision to base a fourth aircraft there, and that the agreement with Ryanair – which plans to 
station three Boeing 737s at the airport – will bring 1 million additional annual passengers from summer 2019.
Factoring in other agreements with Air Malta and Slovenian carrier Adria Airways, Stobart is estimating Southend's 
2019 passenger numbers at 2.5 million. It expects this figure to double by 2022.

Ryanair posted a 9 per cent fall in pretax profit to (EURO)1.3bn in the six months to the end of September, capping 
a bad summer for the airline.
At the weekend, it became embroiled in a row for failing to remove a male passenger on a flight from Barcelona 
who racially abused a black woman.
In the six-month period, average Ryanair fares fell 3 per cent, in line with a recent profit warning, and unit costs rose 
10 per cent amid higher fuel prices and a jump of a third in staff costs. Pilots have received a 20 per cent pay rise.
But good news about revenue, combined with post-tax profit for the second quarter that was slightly ahead of 
consensus, sent shares up 4.9 per cent.
Despite the pay rise for pilots, Ryanair has been hit by industrial action as it negotiated collective labour 
agreements with unions for the first time. It has also suffered, as have competitors, because of strikes by air traffic 
controllers.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said: "While we hope to finalise more union agreements in the coming months, we 
cannot rule out occasional industrial action."
Torrid summer leaves bruises on Ryanair Airlines ; Pre-tax profit down 9% during half - but revenue picture

Strikes, compensation costs and the high price of oil led the airline to issue a profit warning at the start of October, 
cutting its full-year forecast from (EURO)1.25bn-(EURO)1.35bn to (EURO)1.1bn-(EURO)1.2bn. As part of the 
warning, Ryanair announced the closure or downsizing of three bases and the shrinking of its winter capacity.
Mr O'Leary said he could not "rule out further capacity cuts or base closures ... if oil prices rise or air fares fall 
further".
Fuel and oil raised costs 22 per cent to (EURO)1.3bn, despite Ryanair being heavily hedged. The airline said it was 
90 per cent hedged for the next year at $68 a barrel, "well below current spot prices of close to $85 a barrel".
The higher oil price might benefit Ryanair, Alex Paterson, Investec analyst, suggested. "While they said there'll be 
more bad news before good, the bad news will put pressure on the less well capitalised, more marginal airlines."
Ancillary revenue, which is everything except the ticket price, increased 27 per cent to (EURO)1.3bn, helping 
revenue to rise 8 per cent to (EURO)4.8bn. "Key drivers of this growth were improved conversion of priority 
boarding and reserved seating," Mr O'Leary said.
The male passenger in the racist abuse incident has not been publicly identified and has not responded to what 
happened. Ryanair said it had reported the incident to the police in Essex. "As this is now a police matter, we 
cannot comment further," it added.

agreements with unions for the first time. It has also suffered, as have competitors, because of strikes by air traffic 
controllers.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said: "While we hope to finalise more union agreements in the coming months, we 
cannot rule out occasional industrial action."

Strikes, compensation costs and the high price of oil led the airline to issue a profit warning at the start of October, 
cutting its full-year forecast from (EURO)1.25bn-(EURO)1.35bn to (EURO)1.1bn-(EURO)1.2bn. As part of the 
warning, Ryanair announced the closure or downsizing of three bases and the shrinking of its winter capacity.
Mr O'Leary said he could not "rule out further capacity cuts or base closures ... if oil prices rise or air fares fall 
further".
Fuel and oil raised costs 22 per cent to (EURO)1.3bn, despite Ryanair being heavily hedged. The airline said it was 
90 per cent hedged for the next year at $68 a barrel, "well below current spot prices of close to $85 a barrel".
The higher oil price might benefit Ryanair, Alex Paterson, Investec analyst, suggested. "While they said there'll be 
more bad news before good, the bad news will put pressure on the less well capitalised, more marginal airlines."
Ancillary revenue, which is everything except the ticket price, increased 27 per cent to (EURO)1.3bn, helping 
revenue to rise 8 per cent to (EURO)4.8bn. "Key drivers of this growth were improved conversion of priority 
boarding and reserved seating," Mr O'Leary said.
The male passenger in the racist abuse incident has not been publicly identified and has not responded to what 
happened. Ryanair said it had reported the incident to the police in Essex. "As this is now a police matter, we 
cannot comment further," it added.

RYANAIR saw half-year profits decline yesterday, rounding off a troubled few days at the budget airline.
Cheaper fares, higher fuel costs and strikes all hit Ryanair's bottom line, pushing post-tax profits down seven per 
cent year-on-year to (EURO)1.2bn (£1.1bn) for its crucial April to September trading period.
However, revenue grew eight per cent to (EURO)4.79bn compared to the same period in 2017, as passenger 
numbers climbed six per cent to 76.6m.
Flight compensation from strikes, slashed airfares and fuel prices all contributed to a weak half-year set of results 
for the airline, after a week which saw it cause controversy by deciding not to remove an abusive passenger from 
one of its flights amid a racist tirade at a fellow passenger.
Yet shares closed up more than four per cent as investors eyed an opportunity to stock up in the hope that the 
firm's value would once again rise.
Boss Michael O'Leary pointed out that passenger numbers have grown despite the airline's recent troubles, while 
ancillary revenues like luggage fees rose to (EURO)1.3bn.
"Life doesn't seem to be getting worse," said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
Mould added: "A decline in profit isn't a surprise given it had already laid the foundations for a bad set of numbers in 
a previous trading update. Instead, the market is breathing a sigh of relief that full year earnings guidance hasn't 
had to be downgraded again. Nevertheless, Ryanair is still treading a thin line given its warning that full year

guidance is heavily dependent on airfares not falling further, plus other factors like the oil price and the impact of 
Brexit developments."
