 European Commission decision to open in-depth investigation into Ryanair's Offer for Aer Lingus
 Dublin & London, 29 August 2012:  The European Commission today announced its decision to open an in-
depth investigation into Ryanair's latest offer to acquire control of Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus" 
or "Company"), Ryanair's main competitor on routes into and out of Ireland.
 Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus was prohibited in 2007 on competition grounds. Aer Lingus 
is a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous Ryanair offers and is Ryanair's 
only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes.  The number of routes into and out 
of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete has sharply increased since 2007. The reasons for 
prohibition are therefore even stronger than before.
 In addition to the European Commission's in-depth investigation, the UK Competition Commission also 
continues to investigate the harmful effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus, which is 
contrary to the interests of consumers and the majority of our shareholders.

 RYANAIR INTENDS TO RE-BID FOR AER LINGUS IF THE EC GRANTS PHASE II APPROVAL
 Following today's (29 Aug) decision of the European Commission to refer the acquisition of Aer Lingus to Phase II, 
Ryanair's Offer lapses, in accordance with the Takeover Rules, with immediate effect, and all acceptances of the 
Offer to date are void.
 Ryanair intends to re-bid for Aer Lingus if the European Commission clears its offer following its Phase II review.  
The making of any such Further Offer will require consent* of the Takeover Panel to a derogation from the 
prohibition on making a further offer within twelve months after the date on which the original Offer lapsed.
 In keeping with its policy to date, Ryanair will not make any comment other than the above on this process.
 *The relevant Notes to the Takeover Rules specifically provide that the Panel may grant consent in circumstances 
where a previous offer has lapsed as a result of a Phase II review by the European Commission, if following Phase 
II approval by the Commission, a new offer is made within 21 days of the issue of such a clearance.

 Reject Ryanair's Offer - Ryanair's Offer fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus
 The Board of Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus" or "the Board") wrote to shareholders on 31 July 2012 
outlining its reasons for recommending that shareholders reject Ryanair Holdings plc's ("Ryanair") offer 
to purchase the whole of the issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus not already 
owned by Ryanair (the "Offer"). Since the issuance of this circular, no new information has been provided 
by Ryanair in relation to the Offer and the Board re-affirms its recommendation that shareholders should 
reject the Offer.
 Aer Lingus is a strong and profitable airline with a proven business model; a strong balance sheet; and 
an internationally recognised and valued brand. The Board's unanimous view is that Ryanair's Offer to 
acquire control of Aer Lingus for EUR1.30 per share fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus and represents a 
significant discount to the intrinsic value of the business. The Offer of EUR1.30 per share represents:
 --     A discount of 34 per cent. to Aer Lingus' gross cash per share of EUR1.96 (total EUR1,049.9 
million)
 -      the gross cash on Aer Lingus' balance sheet more than pays for Ryanair's Offer
 --     A discount of 12 per cent. to Aer Lingus' Net Asset Value per share of EUR1.48 based on the NAV 
shown in the 30 June 2012 balance sheet
 -      this NAV does not attribute any value to either our attractive slot portfolio or brand
 --     A 2011 adjusted EV / EBITDAR multiple of 4.2x, a 30 per cent. discount to the average trading 
multiple of Aer Lingus' traded peers of 6.0x
 Aer Lingus delivered a EUR130 million turnaround in operating performance between 2009 and 2011. The 
Group continues to make strategic, operating and financial progress. Such progress is reflected in the 
2012 first half results released on 31 July 2012. On that date, Aer Lingus stated that, if current trading 
Aer Lingus Group PLC Reject Ryanair 's Offer
conditions continue, operating profit, before net exceptional items, for 2012 will be at least that 
achieved in 2011 (EUR49.1 million).
 No new information has been provided by Ryanair in relation to the Offer since the Board last wrote to 
shareholders on 31 July 2012. Based on careful consideration of the issues, and extensive legal and 
financial advice, the Board remains of the view that Ryanair's Offer is not in the interests of 
shareholders, fundamentally undervalues the business and, due to the scale and extent of competition 
issues, is likely once more to be prohibited by the European Commission. Accordingly, the Board 
unanimously recommends shareholders take no action in relation to the Offer and should not sign any 
document sent by Ryanair or its advisers.

 Bases and Sources
 The relevant bases of calculation and sources of information are provided below in the order in which the 
relevant information first appears in this announcement and by reference to the relevant statement. Where 
such information is repeated in this document, the underlying bases and sources are not.
 (a)          Reference to "per share" is based on a fully diluted issued share capital of 535,540,090 
shares, including 534,040,090 ordinary shares in issue and 1,500,000 shares subject to options. 
Conditional awards over 9,017,971 ordinary shares under Aer Lingus' Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"), in 
relation to which the trustee of the LTIP does not hold shares for the purposes of satisfying any vesting 
of awards, have been excluded from the fully diluted issued share capital figure as it is not possible to 
calculate how many shares would vest on a change of control becoming effective.
 (b)          "gross cash" is based on gross cash as taken from the 30 June 2012 consolidated balance 
sheet, as reported in the H1 2012 Results.
 (c)           "Net Asset Value" or "NAV" is the amount shown as total equity in the 30 June 2012 
consolidated balance sheet.
 (d)          Reference to "adjusted EV/EBITDAR multiple" has the same meaning given to it in Aer Lingus' 
ISE announcement "Reject Ryanair's offer" dated 18 July 2012, except using market capitalisations at 22 
August 2012.
 (e)          Reference to "traded peers" includes Air France - KLM, easyJet, Flybe, IAG, Lufthansa and 
Ryanair.

3:30 pm (Dublin time) on the business day following the date of the relevant transaction. This requirement 
Aer Lingus Group PLC Reject Ryanair 's Offer
will continue until the date on which the Offer becomes effective or on which the 'Offer period' otherwise 
ends. If two or more persons co-operate on the basis of any agreement, either express or tacit, either 
oral or written, to acquire an 'interest' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair, they will be 
deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules.

 During the first half of 2012 the Company continued to be defensively positioned, reflecting concerns 
over the potential for a slowdown in Chinese growth together with on-going developments around the 
eurozone crisis.  We sold positions in Indus Gas, Smiths Group and Ryanair and reinvested proceeds in a 
number of new holdings. These included Imperial Tobacco, Sage Group and BAE Systems.  Having entered the 
year with no exposure to the banking sector, we also added both HSBC Holdings and Royal Bank of Scotland 
to the portfolio.

 Investment Manager's Report (continued)
 Threadneedle Introduction
 Following Threadneedle's appointment as the Company's investment manager, on the 31st July 2012, the 
Company's portfolio has been realigned with Threadneedle's UK Equity Alpha Strategy. This strategy is run 
by Threadneedle's Head of UK Equities, Simon Brazier, and seeks to deliver consistent performance above 
the FTSE All-Share using a broadly diversified portfolio of 50-90 stocks. At the portfolio level 
diversification is a key driver of portfolio construction. The aim is to diversify the Company by 
investment theme, growth drivers, style and market capitalisation such that the Company is never a one way 
bet on any of these factors. Mr Brazier applies this investment strategy in managing the Threadneedle UK 
Fund, which has delivered top quartile performance since he began managing the fund in April 2010.  Strong 
stock selection, backed by Threadneedle's significant UK equity resource, has been the main driver of 
performance.
 Outlook
 We expect the domestic economy to remain in the doldrums for several years, and the eurozone crisis is 
also likely to continue to affect investor sentiment over the short to medium term.  However, there are 
also a number of positive factors at play.  The UK market offers unrivalled exposure to high quality, 
international earners with three quarters of the market's earnings derived from overseas.  Meanwhile, 
valuations are attractive: the dividend yield is well above the yield on gilts, while dividend cover is 
above the long-term average.  Balance sheets are generally strong, dividend growth is healthy and, by and 
large, corporate financial discipline remains good. Over the long term, the market offers very good value 
and should be able to deliver healthy returns.
 In terms of portfolio positioning, we continue to find valuation opportunities across all sectors. The 
main underweights remain UK Banks and Mining where we still see downside risk. Our focus in portfolio 
construction centres on identifying financially-robust and well-managed companies where future cash flows

are not reflected in valuations. We are then using the short term volatility in the market to exploit this 
long term valuation opportunity.

 RYANAIR UPDATE ON LONDON STANSTED AIRPORT SALE
 As confirmed in Ryanair's 2012 annual report (issued 31 July) Ryanair has held discussions with a number of 
parties who are interested in bidding for Stansted Airport.  In some of these discussions Ryanair has confirmed that 
it is willing (subject to a competitive cost offer) to deliver traffic growth at Stansted over a 5 year period and has 
been asked to consider acquiring a minority stake (of less than 25%) should a successful consortium consider it 
necessary or valuable to commit Ryanair to Stansted airport as a minority equity investor.

 Special Business to be considered at the Annual General Meeting
 Your attention is drawn to the Notice of Meeting on pages 3 to 5 which sets out matters to be considered 
at the Annual General Meeting. In addition to the ordinary business there are three Resolutions relating 
to special business.
 Resolution 5 - Directors' Authority to Allot Ordinary Shares
 The Directors are seeking to renew their authority to allot shares in the authorised but unissued share 
capital of the Company for the period up to September 20, 2017.
 Resolution 6 - Disapplication of Statutory pre-emption Rights
 As was the case at previous years' Annual General Meetings, the Directors are seeking authority to allot 
Ordinary Shares without first offering them to existing shareholders in accordance with statutory pre-
emption rights where the Ordinary Shares are allotted:-
 (a)           on the exercise of any option in accordance with the provisions of the existing Ryanair 
Holdings plc Share Option Plans of 2000 & 2003;
 (b)           in connection with a rights issue; and
 (c)           otherwise than in pursuance of (a) and (b) above, up to an aggregate nominal value of the 
greater of EUR457,411 or 5% of the then issued share capital of the Company.
 It is proposed to renew this authority for the period expiring fifteen months from the passing of this 
Resolution or, if earlier, on the day following the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
 Resolution 7 - Authority to Repurchase Shares
 At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on April 19, 2012 (the EGM) the Directors sought and obtained 
an amendment to the share repurchase authority granted at previous years' Annual General Meetings to allow 
the Company to repurchase shares from both the Ordinary Share pool and the American Depositary Share (the 
ADS) pool. The Directors are now seeking to renew the authority granted at the EGM.  Any ADSs repurchased 
will be converted to Ordinary Shares and cancelled as will Ordinary Shares repurchased, and the number of 
Ordinary Shares in issue will reduce accordingly.
 In line with the authority granted at the EGM, the maximum price at which Ordinary Shares traded on the 
Irish Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange could be repurchased would be the higher of (i) 5% above 
the average market value of the Company's Ordinary Shares on the Irish Stock Exchange for the five 
business days prior to the date of purchase and; (ii) the price stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) of 22 December, 2003 (No. 2273/2003), being the higher of the last independent trade and 
the highest current independent bid on the trading venue on which the shares are being repurchased. It is 
further proposed that the maximum price at which Ordinary Shares which underlie the Company's ADSs which 
are traded on NASDAQ could be repurchased would be 5% above the average market value of one-fifth of the 
Company's ADSs on NASDAQ for the five business days prior to the date of purchase (as one ADS represents 
five Ordinary Shares).
 The minimum price at which Ordinary Shares could be repurchased would be their nominal value of 0.635 
euro cents. The authority will also enable the Company to repurchase in US dollars or euro.
 Recommendation of Directors
 The Directors believe that the passing of the Resolutions set out in the Notice of Meeting is in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and the Directors unanimously recommend that you 
vote in favour of such Resolutions as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings in 
Ordinary Shares which, as at the date of this letter, represent approximately 4.24% of the issued share 
capital of the Company.
 Yours sincerely,
 David Bonderman
 Chairman

 7.             To consider and if thought fit pass the following Resolution as a Special Resolution:-
 "That the Company and/or any subsidiary (as such expression is defined by Section 155 of the Companies 
Act, 1963) of the Company be and they are hereby generally authorised to make market purchases (as defined 
by Section 212 of the Companies Act, 1990) of the Company's Ordinary Shares on such terms and conditions 
and in such manner as the Directors or, as the case may be, the Directors of such subsidiary, may from 
time to time determine in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1990 and the 
following restrictions and provisions:
 (i)            the maximum aggregate number of shares authorised to be acquired pursuant to this 
resolution shall not exceed 72.03 million Ordinary Shares;
 (ii)           the minimum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for any such Ordinary Share 
shall be an amount equal to the nominal value thereof;
 (iii)          the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for any such Ordinary Share 
shall not exceed the higher of:
 A. the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the 
trading venue where the purchase is carried out, as stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation 
(EC) (No. 2273/2003) of 22 December 2003 implementing the Market Abuse Directive 2003/6/EC as regards 
exemptions for buy-back programmes and stabilisation of financial instruments; and
 B. 105% of the average of the Relevant Price for such Ordinary Shares of the same class for each of the 
five (5) business days immediately preceding the day of the purchase of the Ordinary Shares; and
 (iv)          for the purpose of sub-paragraph (iii)(B), "Relevant Price" means, in respect of the 
purchase of Ordinary Shares traded on the Irish Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange, on any 
business day on which there shall be a dealing in the Ordinary Shares on the Irish Stock Exchange (or any 
successor thereto) in respect of shares of the same class, the official closing price in respect of such 
shares as published in the Irish Stock Exchange Daily Official List or any successor publications thereto 
(the "ISE List") and, in respect of any business day on which there shall be no such dealing, the ISE 
Closing Mid-Market Price as derived from the ISE List;
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement -2-
 (v)           for the purpose of sub-paragraph (iii)(B), "Relevant Price" means, in respect of the 
purchase of Ordinary Shares underlying American Depositary Shares traded on NASDAQ, on any business day on 
which there shall be a dealing in ADSs on NASDAQ (or any successor thereto), one-fifth of the NASDAQ 
Official Close Price in respect of such ADSs as published by NASDAQ (or its equivalent if such a price is 
no longer published by NASDAQ) and, in respect of any business day on which there shall be no such 
dealing, one-fifth of the NASDAQ Official Open Price in respect of such ADSs on that day as published by 
NASDAQ (or its equivalent if such a price is no longer published by NASDAQ);
 (vi)          PROVIDED THAT if no ISE Closing Mid-Market Price is available on the Irish Stock Exchange, 
for the purposes of (iv) above for any particular day, then that day shall not count as one of the said 
five (5) business days for the purpose of determining the Relevant Price, and, at the discretion of the 
Directors, either another business day preceding the day of purchase of the shares on which such a price 
is available shall be substituted for such day, or the number of business days by reference to which the 
Relevant Price is to be calculated shall be reduced accordingly. If the means of providing the foregoing 
information as to dealings and prices, by reference to which the maximum price is to be determined, is 
altered or is replaced by some other means, then the maximum price shall be determined on the basis of the 
equivalent (as nearly as practicable) information published by the relevant authority in relation to 
dealings or, if no such information is available, by such other method as the Directors shall determine to 
be fair and reasonable;
 (vii)         for the purposes of this resolution the "ISE Closing Mid-Market Price" shall be the average 
of the closing best bid and the closing best offer as published on the ISE List; and
 (viii)        This authority will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting or 
15 months from the date of the passing of this resolution, unless previously varied, revoked or renewed in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 215 of the Companies Act, 1990. The Company or any subsidiary 
may before such expiry enter into a contract for the purchase of Ordinary Shares which would or might be 
wholly or partly executed after such expiry and may complete any such contract as if the authority 
conferred hereby had not expired."

 Personnel Costs. Ryanair endeavors to control its labor costs by seeking to continually improve the productivity of 
its already highly productive work force. Compensation for employees emphasizes productivity-based pay 
incentives. These incentives include commissions for onboard sales of products for flight attendants and payments 
based on the number of hours or sectors flown by pilots and flight attendants within limits set by industry standards 
or regulations fixing maximum working hours.
 Customer Service Costs. Ryanair has entered into agreements on competitive terms with external contractors at 
certain airports for ticketing, passenger and aircraft handling, and other services that management believes can be 
more cost-efficiently provided by third parties. Management attempts to obtain competitive rates for such services 
by negotiating fixed-price, multi-year contracts. The development of its own Internet booking facility has allowed 
Ryanair to eliminate travel agent commissions and third-party reservation systems costs. Ryanair generates over 
99% of its scheduled passenger revenues through direct sales via its website.
 Airport Access and Handling Costs. Ryanair attempts to control airport access and service charges by focusing on 
airports that offer competitive prices. Management believes that Ryanair's record of delivering a consistently high 
volume of passenger traffic growth at many airports has allowed it to negotiate favorable contracts with such 
airports for access to their facilities. Ryanair further endeavors to reduce its airport charges by opting, when 
practicable, for less expensive gate locations as well as outdoor boarding stairs, rather than jetways, which are 
more expensive and operationally less efficient to use. In addition, since October 2009, Ryanair has required all 
passengers to check-in on the Internet. This requirement was instituted to reduce waiting times at airports and 
speed a passenger's journey from arrival at the airport to boarding, as well as significantly reduce airport handling 
costs. Ryanair has also introduced a checked-bag fee, which is payable on the Internet at the time of booking and is 
aimed at reducing the number of bags carried by passengers in order to further reduce handling costs. See "Risk 
Factors-Risks Related to the Company-The Company Faces Risks Related to its Internet Reservations Operations 
and its Announced Elimination of Airport Check-in Facilities."
 Taking Advantage of the Internet. In 2000, Ryanair converted its host reservation system to a new system, which it 
operates under a hosting agreement with Navitaire that was extended in 2011 and will terminate in 2020. As part of 
the implementation of the new reservation system, Navitaire developed an Internet booking facility. The Ryanair 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -24-
system allows Internet users to access its host reservation system and to make and pay for confirmed reservations 
in real time through the Ryanair.com website. After the launch of the Internet reservation system, Ryanair heavily 
promoted its website through newspaper, radio and television advertising. As a result, Internet bookings grew 
rapidly, and have accounted for over 99% of all reservations over the past several years. In May 2012, Ryanair 
further upgraded the reservation system, which offers more flexibility for future system enhancements and to 
accommodate the future growth of Ryanair.
 Commitment to Safety and Quality Maintenance. Safety is the primary priority of Ryanair and its management. This 
commitment begins with the hiring and training of Ryanair's pilots, flight attendants, and maintenance personnel 
and includes a policy of maintaining its aircraft in accordance with the highest European airline industry standards. 
Ryanair has not had a single passenger or flight crew fatality as a result of an accident with one of its aircraft in its 
27-year operating history. Although Ryanair seeks to maintain its fleet in a cost-effective manner, management 
does not seek to extend Ryanair's low-cost operating strategy to the areas of safety, maintenance, training or 
quality assurance. Routine aircraft maintenance and repair services are performed primarily by Ryanair, at 
Ryanair's main bases, but are also performed at other base airports by maintenance contractors approved under 
the terms of Part 145. Ryanair currently performs heavy airframe maintenance, but contracts with other parties who 
perform engine overhaul services and rotable repairs. These contractors also provide similar services to a number 
of other airlines, including British Airways, Finnair and Iberia. Ryanair assigns a Part 145-certified mechanic to 
oversee engine overhauls performed by other parties.
 Enhancement of Operating Results through Ancillary Services. Ryanair distributes accommodation services and 
travel insurance primarily through its website. For hotel services, Ryanair has a contract with Hotelscombined PTY 
Ltd, and they provide a hotel comparison website to Ryanair which generates commissions for Ryanair on the 
number of bookings made.  Ryanair also has contracts with other accommodation providers that enable Ryanair to 
offer camping, hostel, bed-and-breakfast, guesthouse, villa and apartment accommodation to its customers. In 
addition Ryanair has a contract with the Hertz Corporation ("Hertz"), pursuant to which Hertz handles all car rental 
services marketed through Ryanair's website or telephone reservation system. Ryanair also sells bus and rail 
tickets onboard its aircraft and through its website. For the 2012 fiscal year, ancillary services accounted for 
approximately 20% of Ryanair's total operating revenues, as compared to approximately 22% of such revenues in 
the 2011 fiscal year. See "-Ancillary Services" below and "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-
Results of Operations-Fiscal Year 2012 Compared with Fiscal Year 2011-Ancillary Revenues" for additional 
information.
 Focused Criteria for Growth.Building on its success in the Ireland-U.K. market and its expansion of service to 
continental Europe and Morocco, Ryanair intends to follow a manageable growth plan targeting specific markets. 
Ryanair believes it will have opportunities for continued growth by: (i) initiating additional routes in the EU; (ii) 
initiating additional routes in countries party to a European Common Aviation Agreement with the EU that are 
currently served by higher-cost, higher-fare carriers; (iii) increasing the frequency of service on its existing routes; 
(iv) starting new domestic routes within individual EU countries; (v) considering acquisition opportunities that may 
become available in the future; (vi) connecting airports within its existing route network ("triangulation"); (vii) 
establishing new bases; and (viii) initiating new routes not currently served by any carrier.
 During the 2007 fiscal year, the Company acquired 25.2% of Aer Lingus. The Company thereafter increased its 
interest to 29.3% during the 2008 fiscal year, and to 29.8% during the 2009 fiscal year at a total aggregate cost of 
EUR407.2 million. Following the acquisition of the Company's initial stake in Aer Lingus during fiscal 2007, and after 
approval by the Company's shareholders, Company management proposed to effect a tender offer to acquire the 
entire share capital of Aer Lingus (the "2006 Offer"). This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by the European 
Commission on competition grounds. Ryanair filed an appeal with the EU Court of First Instance ("CFI"; now the 
"General Court"), in July 2010. The CFI upheld the European Commission's decision.
 On December 1, 2008, Ryanair made a second offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not 
own, at a price of EUR1.40 per ordinary share. Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, 
maintain the Aer Lingus brand, and retain its Heathrow slots and connectivity. Ryanair also proposed to double Aer 
Lingus' short-haul fleet from 33 to 66 aircraft and to create 1,000 associated new jobs over a five-year period. If the 
offer had been accepted, the Irish government would have received over EUR180 million in cash. The employee 
share option trust and employees, who owned 18% of Aer Lingus, would have received over EUR137 million in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -24-
cash. The Company met Aer Lingus management, representatives of the employee share option trust and other 
parties, including the Irish Government. The offer of EUR1.40 per share represented a premium of approximately 
25% over the closing price of EUR1.12 of Aer Lingus on November 28, 2008. However, as the Company was 
unable to secure the shareholders' support (to sell their stakes in Aer Lingus to Ryanair), the Company decided on 
January 28, 2009, to withdraw its offer for Aer Lingus.
 Between 2010 and 2012 the United Kingdom's OFT investigated Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus and in June 
2012 referred the matter to the UK Competition Commission for further investigation. See "Item 8. Financial 
Information-Other Financial Information-Legal Proceedings-Matters Related to Investment in Aer Lingus."
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair made a third offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not own at a 
price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share.  The timing of the offer has been influenced by: (1) the continued 
consolidation of European airlines, and more recently the International Airlines Group (the parent company of 
British Airways) takeover of British Midland International, where the No. 1 airline at Heathrow was allowed to 
acquire the No. 2; (2) the additional capacity available at Dublin airport following the opening of Terminal 2 and the 
decline in traffic from 23.3 million passengers per annum in 2007 to 18.7 million in 2011, resulting in Dublin airport 
operating at approximately 50% capacity; (3) the change in the Irish government policy since 2006 in that the Irish 
government has decided to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (4) the fact that under the terms of the bailout agreement 
provided by the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (collectively 
the "Troika") to Ireland, the Irish government has committed to sell its stake in

* Decrease on prior year due to lower aircraft in operation in March 2012 and cabin crew staff being furloughed.
 Ryanair's pilots, flight attendants and maintenance and ground operations personnel undergo training, both initial 
and recurrent. A substantial portion of the initial training for Ryanair's flight attendants is devoted to safety 
procedures, and cabin crew are required to undergo annual evacuation and fire drill training during their tenure with 
the airline. Ryanair also provides salary increases to its engineers who complete advanced training in certain fields 
of aircraft maintenance. Ryanair utilizes its own Boeing 737-800 aircraft simulators for pilot training.
 IAA regulations require pilots to be licensed as commercial pilots with specific ratings for each aircraft to be flown. 
In addition, IAA regulations require all commercial pilots to be medically certified as physically fit. At March 31, 
2012, the average age of Ryanair's pilots was 34 years and their average period of employment with Ryanair was 
4.8 years. Licenses and medical certification are subject to periodic re-evaluation and require recurrent training and 
recent flying experience in order to be maintained. Maintenance engineers must be licensed and qualified for 
specific aircraft types. Flight attendants must undergo initial and periodic competency training. Training programs 
are subject to approval and monitoring by the IAA. In addition, the appointment of senior management personnel 
directly involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance and aircraft inspection must be 
satisfactory to the IAA. Based on its experience in managing the airline's growth to date, management believes that 
there is a sufficient pool of qualified and licensed pilots, engineers and mechanics within the EU to satisfy Ryanair's 
anticipated future needs in the areas of flight operations, maintenance and quality control and that Ryanair will not 
face significant difficulty in hiring and continuing to employ the required personnel. Ryanair has also been able to 
satisfy its needs for additional pilots through the use of contract agencies.  These contract pilots are included in the 
table above. In addition, Ryanair has also been able to satisfy its needs for additional flight attendants through the 
use of contract agencies. These contract flight attendants are included in the table above.
 Ryanair has licensed approved organizations in Sweden and Holland to operate pilot training courses using 
Ryanair's syllabus, in order to grant Boeing 737 type-ratings. Each trainee pilot must pay for his or her own training 
and, based on his or her performance, he or she may be offered a position operating on Ryanair aircraft. This 
program enables Ryanair to secure a continuous stream of type-rated co-pilots.
 Ryanair's employees earn productivity-based incentive payments, including a sales bonus for onboard sales for 
flight attendants and payments based on the number of hours or sectors flown by pilots and flight attendants (within 
limits set by industry standards or regulations fixing maximum working hours). During the 2012 fiscal year, such 
productivity-based incentive payments accounted for approximately 47% of an average flight attendant's total 
earnings and approximately 37% of the typical pilot's compensation.  Pilots at all Ryanair bases are covered by 
four-year agreements on pay, allowances and rosters which variously fall due for negotiation between 2013 and 
2015. In March 2012, Ryanair agreed to increase the pay of pilots and cabin crew in accordance with the terms of 
individual base agreements. The remaining employees who were not covered by base agreements had their salary 
frozen for a period of 12 months. Ryanair's pilots are currently subject to IAA-approved limits of 100 flight-hours per 
28-day cycle and 900 flight-hours per fiscal year. For the 2012 fiscal year, the average flight-hours for Ryanair's 
pilots amounted to approximately 70 hours per month and approximately 839 hours for the complete year, a 2% 
increase on the previous fiscal year. Were more stringent regulations on flight hours to be adopted, Ryanair's flight 
personnel could experience a reduction in their total pay due to lower compensation for the number of hours or 
sectors flown and Ryanair could be required to hire additional flight personnel.
 Ryanair considers its relations with its employees to be good. Ryanair currently negotiates with groups of 
employees, including its pilots, through "Employee Representation Committees" ("ERCs") regarding pay, work 
practices and conditions of employment, including conducting formal negotiations with these internal collective 
bargaining units. Ryanair's senior management meets regularly with the different ERCs to discuss all aspects of the 
business and those issues that specifically relate to each relevant employee group.
 On June 19, 2009, BALPA (the U.K. pilots union) made a request for voluntary recognition under applicable U.K. 
legislation, which Ryanair rejected. BALPA had the option of applying to the U.K.'s Central Arbitration Committee 
(CAC) to organize a vote on union recognition by Ryanair's pilots in relevant bargaining units, as determined by the 
CAC but BALPA decided not to proceed with an application at that time. The option to apply for a ballot remains 
open to BALPA and if it were to seek and be successful in such a ballot, it would be able to represent the U.K. pilots 
in negotiations over salaries and working conditions.

 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 Legal Proceedings
 The Company is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. Although no assurance can be 
given as to the outcome of any current or pending litigation, management does not believe that any of such litigation 
will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition 
of the Company, except as otherwise described below.
 EU State Aid-Related Proceedings. On December 11, 2002, the European Commission announced the launch of 
an investigation into the 2001 agreement among Ryanair, the Brussels (Charleroi) airport and the government of 
the Walloon Region of Belgium, the owner of the airport, which enabled the Company to launch new routes and 
base up to four aircraft at Brussels (Charleroi). The European Commission's investigation was based on an 
anonymous complaint alleging that Ryanair's arrangements with Brussels (Charleroi) constituted illegal state aid.
 The European Commission issued its decision on February 12, 2004. As regards the majority of the arrangements 
between Ryanair, the airport and the region, the European Commission found that although they constituted state 
aid, they were nevertheless compatible with the EC Treaty provisions and therefore did not require repayment. 
However, the European Commission also found that certain other arrangements did constitute illegal state aid and 
therefore ordered Ryanair to repay the amount of the benefit received in connection with those arrangements. On 
April 20, 2004, the Walloon Region wrote to Ryanair requesting repayment of such state aid, although it 
acknowledged that Ryanair could offset against the amount of such state aid certain costs incurred in relation to the 
establishment of the base, in accordance with the European Commission's decision. Ryanair made the requested 
repayment.
 On May 25, 2004, Ryanair appealed the decision of the European Commission to the CFI, requesting the court to 
annul the decision because:
 the European Commission infringed Article 253 of the EC Treaty by failing to provide adequate reasons for its 
decision; and
 the European Commission misapplied Article 87 of the EC Treaty by failing to properly apply the Market Economy 
Investor Principle (MEIP), which generally holds that an investment made by a public entity that would have been 
made on the same basis by a private entity does not constitute state aid.
 In March 2008, Ryanair had its hearing before the CFI, and in December 2008, the CFI annulled the European 
Commission's decision, and Ryanair was repaid the EUR4 million that the Commission had claimed was illegal 
state aid. The Belgian government has also withdrawn a separate EUR2.3 million action against Ryanair arising 
from the European Commission's decision.
 In July 2012, the European Commission concluded that the financial arrangements between the Tampere airport in 
Finland and Ryanair do not constitute state aid within the meaning of EU rules, because such arrangements are in 
line with market terms.
 Ryanair is facing similar legal challenges with respect to agreements with certain other airports, notably Lubeck, 
Berlin (Schonefeld), Alghero, Pau, Aarhus, Frankfurt (Hahn), Dusseldorf (Weeze), Zweibrucken, Altenburg, 
Klagenfurt, (Stockholm) Vasteras, Paris (Beauvais), La Rochelle, Carcassonne, Nimes, Angouleme, Marseille and 
Brussels (Charleroi). In January 2010, the European commission concluded the Bratislava state aid investigation 
with a finding that Ryanair's agreement with Bratislava airport involved no aid. The remaining nineteen 
investigations involving Ryanair are ongoing and Ryanair currently expects that they will conclude within the next 12 
months, with any European Commission's decisions appealable to the EU General Court.
 State aid complaints by Lufthansa about Ryanair's cost base at Frankfurt (Hahn) have been rejected by German 
courts, as have similar complaints by Air Berlin in relation to Ryanair's arrangement with Lubeck airport, but 
following a German Supreme Court ruling on a procedural issue in early 2011, these cases will be re-heard by 
lower courts. In addition, Ryanair has been involved in legal challenges including allegations of state aid at Alghero 
and Marseille airports. The Alghero case (initiated by Air One) was dismissed in its entirety in April 2011. The 
Marseille case was withdrawn by the plaintiffs (subsidiaries of Air France) in May 2011.
 In September 2005, the European Commission announced new guidelines on the financing of airports and the 
provision of start-up aid to airlines departing from regional airports, based on the European Commission's finding in 
the Brussels (Charleroi) case, which Ryanair successfully appealed. The guidelines apply only to publicly owned 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -47-
regional airports, and place restrictions on the incentives these airports can offer airlines to deliver traffic. The 
guidelines apply only in cases in which the terms offered by a public airport are in excess of what a similar private 
airport would have offered. Ryanair deals with airports, both public and private, on an equal basis and receives the 
same cost agreements from both. The guidelines have therefore had no impact on Ryanair's business, although 
they have caused significant uncertainty in the industry in relation to what public airports may or may not do in order 
to attract traffic.
 Ryanair believes that the positive decision by the CFI in the Brussels (Charleroi) case has caused the European 
Commission to rethink its policy in this area. Ryanair believes that the CFI's findings should be addressed in the 
ongoing revision of the guidelines. However, adverse rulings in the above or similar cases could be used as 
precedents by other competitors to challenge Ryanair's agreements with other publicly owned airports and could 
cause Ryanair to strongly reconsider its growth strategy in relation to public or state-owned airports across Europe. 
This could in turn lead to a scaling back of Ryanair's growth strategy due to the smaller number of privately owned 
airports available for development. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these proceedings, nor as to 
whether any unfavorable outcomes may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
results of operations or financial condition of the Company.
 In November 2007, Ryanair initiated proceedings in the CFI against the European Commission for its failure to take 
action on a number of state aid complaints Ryanair had submitted against Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia, Volare 
and Olympic Airways. Following the European Commission's subsequent findings that illegal state aid had been 
provided to Air France and Olympic Airways, Ryanair withdrew the two relevant proceedings. The case related to 
Lufthansa concluded with the EU General Court's ruling in May 2011, in which the Court found that while the 
European Commission has not failed to act, it has unreasonably delayed the launch of the investigation, which 
justified Ryanair's action for failure to act. Consequently, the Court ordered the European Commission to pay 50% 
of Ryanair's costs in the proceedings. Similarly, in October 2011, the General Court found that the European 
Commission has failed to act on Ryanair's 2005-2006 complaints against state aid to Alitalia. The European 
Commission has appealed that ruling.
 In November 2008, Ryanair initiated proceedings in the CFI contesting the European Commission's refusal to grant 
Ryanair access to documents relating to the European Commission's state aid investigations at Hamburg (Lubeck), 
Tampere, Berlin (Schonefeld), Alghero, Pau, Aarhus, Bratislava and Frankfurt (Hahn) airports. These cases were 
heard on July 7, 2010 and a judgment was issued in December 2010. The CFI found that the European 
Commission had acted in line with applicable legislation, which highlighted the unfairness inherent in state aid 
procedures in the EU, whereby alleged beneficiaries of aid have no right of access to the European Commission's 
files and therefore cannot properly exercise their rights to defense and good administration. The CFI ordered the 
European Commission to pay Ryanair's costs in three of the eight access to documents cases.

 RISK FACTORS
 Risks Related to the Company
 Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse 
Impact to the Company's Profitability. Jet fuel costs are subject to wide fluctuations as a result of many economic 
and political factors and events occurring throughout the world that Ryanair can neither control nor accurately 
predict, including increases in demand, sudden disruptions in supply and other concerns about global supply, as 
well as market speculation. For example, although they declined in the 2010 fiscal year, oil prices increased 
substantially in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 and remain at elevated levels.  As international prices for jet fuel are 
denominated in U.S. dollars, Ryanair's fuel costs are also subject to certain exchange rate risks. Substantial price 
increases, adverse exchange rates, or the unavailability of adequate supplies, including, without limitation, any such 
events resulting from international terrorism, prolonged hostilities in the Middle East or other oil-producing regions 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -15-
or the suspension of production by any significant producer, may adversely affect Ryanair's profitability. In the event 
of a fuel shortage resulting from a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, additional increases in fuel prices or a 
curtailment of scheduled services could result.
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
Ryanair (like many other airlines) has, in more recent periods, entered into hedging arrangements on a more 
selective basis. As of July 27, 2012, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering 
approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013 at prices equivalent to 
approximately $1,000 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 27, 2012, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet 
kerosene) contracts covering approximately 50% of its estimated requirements for the first half of the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 2014 at prices equivalent to approximately $935 per metric ton, and had not entered into any jet 
fuel hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that quarter. Because of the limited 
nature of its hedging program, the Company is exposed to risks arising from fluctuations in the price of fuel, and 
movements in the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate, especially in light of the recent volatility in the relevant markets. 
Any new increase in fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and 
results of operations. In addition, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro could have an adverse effect 
on the cost of buying fuel in euro. As of July 27, 2012, Ryanair had hedged 90% of its forecasted fuel-related dollar 
purchases against the euro at a rate of $1.38 per euro for the period to March 31, 2013, without, however, having 
entered into any material hedging arrangements with respect to periods thereafter. See "-The Company May Not 
Be Successful in Raising Fares to Offset Increased Business Costs" below.
 No assurances whatsoever can be given about trends in fuel prices, and average fuel prices for the 2013 fiscal 
year or for future years may be significantly higher than current prices. Management estimates that every $10 
movement in the price of a metric ton of jet fuel will impact Ryanair's costs by approximately EUR1.0 million, taking 
into account Ryanair's hedging program for the 2013 fiscal year. There can be no assurance, however, in this 
regard, and the impact of fuel prices on Ryanair's operating results may be more pronounced. There also cannot be 
any assurance that Ryanair's current or any future arrangements will be adequate to protect Ryanair from increases 
in the price of fuel or that Ryanair will not incur losses due to high fuel prices alone or in combination with other 
factors. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Fuel Price Exposure and 
Hedging." Because of Ryanair's low fares and its no-fuel-surcharges policy, as well as the Company's expansion 
plans, which could have a negative impact on yields, its ability to pass on increased fuel costs to passengers 
through increased fares or otherwise is somewhat limited. Moreover, the anticipated expansion of Ryanair's fleet in 
2013 will result in an increase, in absolute terms, in Ryanair's aggregate fuel costs.
 Based upon Ryanair's fuel consumption for the 2012 fiscal year, a change of $10 in the average annual price per 
metric ton of jet fuel at the prevailing euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate would have caused a change of approximately 
EUR17.0 million in the Company's annual fuel costs. Ryanair's fuel costs in the 2012 fiscal year, after giving effect 
to the Company's fuel hedging activities, increased by approximately 30% from the comparable period ended 
March 31, 2011, to EUR1,593.6 million, primarily due to higher market prices per metric ton and growth of the 
airline. Ryanair estimates that its fuel costs would have been approximately EUR1,923.9 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year, as compared to EUR1,275.1 million in the 2011 fiscal year, had Ryanair not had any fuel hedging 
arrangements in place in either fiscal year.

Body
 Emissions Trading. On November 19, 2008, the European Council of Ministers adopted legislation to add aviation 
to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme as of 2012. This scheme, which has thus far applied mainly to energy 
producers, is a cap-and-trade system for CO(2) emissions to encourage industries to improve their CO(2) 
efficiency. Under the legislation, airlines were granted initial CO(2) allowances based on historical "revenue ton 
kilometers" and a CO(2) efficiency benchmark. Any shortage of allowances has to be purchased in the open market 
and/or at government auctions. The Company has estimated its carbon credit requirements in respect of 2012 and 
has hedged its exposures at a cost of approximately EUR10 to EUR15 million. Management believes that this 
legislation is likely to have a negative impact on the European airline industry.  Ryanair takes its environmental 
responsibilities seriously and intends to continue to improve its environmental efficiency and to minimize emissions.
 Aviation Taxes. Ryanair is fundamentally opposed to the introduction of any aviation taxes, including any 
environmental taxes, fuel taxes or emissions levies. Ryanair has and continues to offer the lowest fares in Europe, 
to make passenger air travel affordable and accessible to European consumers. Ryanair believes that the 
imposition of additional taxes on airlines will not only increase airfares, but will discourage new entrants into the 
market, resulting in less choice for consumers. Ryanair believes this would ultimately have adverse effects on the 
European economy in general. There is in particular no justification for any environmental taxes on aviation 
following the introduction of the Emissions Trading Scheme for airlines.
 As a company, Ryanair believes in free market competition and that the imposition of aviation taxation would favor 
the less efficient flag carriers - which generally have smaller and older aircraft, lower load factors, and a much 
higher fuel burn per passenger, and which operate primarily into congested airports - and reduce competition. 
Furthermore, the introduction of a tax at a European level only would distort competition between airlines operating 
solely within Europe and those operating also outside of Europe. We believe that the introduction of such a tax 
would also be incompatible with international law. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Introduction of New or 
Increases in Existing Aviation Taxes Could Increase Costs."
 Airport charges
 The EU Airport Charges Directive of March 2009 sets forth general principles that are to be followed by airports 
with more than five million passenger per annum, and all capital city airports irrespective of their passenger 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -33-
throughput, when setting airport charges, and provides for an appeals procedure for airlines in the event they are 
not satisfied with the level of charges. However, Ryanair does not believe that this procedure will be effective or that 
it will constrain those airports that are currently abusing their dominant position, in part because the legislation was 
mis-transposed in certain countries, such as Ireland, so as to deprive airlines of even the basic safeguards provided 
for in the Directive. This legislation may in fact lead to higher airport charges, depending on how its provisions are 
applied by EU member states and subsequently by the courts.
 Slots
 Currently, the majority of Ryanair's bases of operations have no "slot" allocation restrictions; however, traffic at a 
substantial number of the airports Ryanair serves, including its primary bases, are regulated by means of "slot" 
allocations, which represent authorizations to take off or land at a particular airport within a specified time period. In 
addition, EU law currently regulates the acquisition, transfer, and loss of slots. Applicable EU regulations currently 
prohibit the buying or selling of slots for cash. The European Commission adopted a regulation in April 2004 
(Regulation (EC) No. 793/2004) that made some minor amendments to the current allocation system, allowing for 
limited transfers of, but not trading in, slots. Slots may be transferred from one route to another by the same carrier, 
transferred within a group or as part of a change of control of a carrier, or swapped between carriers. In April 2008, 
the European Commission issued a communication on the application of the slot allocation regulation, signaling the 
acceptance of secondary trading of airport slots between airlines. This is expected to allow more flexibility and 
mobility in the use of slots and will further enhance possibilities for market entry at slot constrained airports. Any 
future legislation that might create an official secondary market for slots could create a potential source of revenue 
for certain of Ryanair's current and potential competitors, many of which have many more slots allocated at primary 
airports at present than Ryanair. The European Union is currently considering such proposals as part of a review of 
the slots legislation announced in December 2011. Slot values depend on several factors, including the airport, time 
of day covered, the availability of slots and the class of aircraft. Ryanair's ability to gain access to and develop its 
operations at slot-controlled airports will be affected by the availability of slots for takeoffs and landings at these 
specific airports. New entrants to an airport are currently given certain privileges in terms of obtaining slots, but 
such privileges are subject to the grandfathered rights of existing operators that are utilizing their slots. While 
Ryanair generally seeks to avoid slot-controlled airports, there is no assurance that Ryanair will be able to obtain a 
sufficient number of slots at the slot-controlled airports that it desires to serve in the future at the time it needs them 
or on acceptable terms.
 Other
 Health and occupational safety issues relating to the Company are largely addressed in Ireland by the Safety, 
Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 and other regulations under that act. Although licenses or permits are not 
issued under such legislation, compliance is monitored by the Health and Safety Authority (the "Authority"), which is 
the regulating body in this area. The Authority periodically reviews Ryanair's health and safety record and when 
appropriate, issues improvement notices or prohibition notices. Ryanair has responded to all such notices to the 
satisfaction of the Authority. Other safety issues are covered by the Irish Aviation Orders, which may vary from time 
to time.
 The Company's operations are subject to the general laws of Ireland and, insofar as they are applicable in Ireland, 
the laws of the EU. The Company may also become subject to additional regulatory requirements in the future. The 
Company is also subject to local laws and regulations at locations where it operates and the regulations of various 
local authorities that operate the airports it serves.
 DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -33-
 HISTORY
 Ryanair's current business strategy dates to the early 1990s, when a new management team, including the current 
chief executive, commenced the restructuring of Ryanair's operations to become a low-fares airline based on the 
low-cost operating model pioneered by Southwest Airlines Co. in the United States. During the period between 
1992 and 1994, Ryanair expanded its route network to include scheduled passenger services between Dublin and 
Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow (Prestwick). In 1994, Ryanair began standardizing its fleet by purchasing 
used Boeing 737-200A aircraft to replace substantially all of its leased aircraft. Beginning in 1996, Ryanair 
continued to expand its service from Dublin to new provincial destinations in the U.K. In August 1996, Irish Air, L.P., 
an investment vehicle led by David Bonderman and certain of his associates at the Texas Pacific Group, acquired a 
minority interest in the Company. Ryanair Holdings completed its initial public offering in June 1997.
 From 1997 through June 30, 2012, Ryanair launched service on more than 1,500 routesthroughout Europe and 
also increased the frequency of service on a number of its principal routes. During that period, in addition to Dublin, 
Ryanair established 51 airports as bases of operations. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Route System, 
Scheduling and Fares" for a list of these bases. Ryanair has increased the number of booked passengers from 4.9 
million in the 1999 fiscal year to approximately 75.8 million in the 2012 fiscal year. Ryanair had 294 Boeing 737-800 
aircraft as of June 30, 2012, and now serves approximately 160 airports with a team of over 8,500 people.
 Ryanair expects to have 305 aircraft in its operating fleet by March 31, 2013. During the period through March 
2014, the Company may hand back up to four Boeing 737-800 aircraft, as leases mature, thereby reducing the size 
of the Company's fleet to 301 aircraft. See "[3/4]Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Item 4. Information on the 
Company[3/4]Aircraft" for additional details.
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 Since Ryanair pioneered its ultra low cost operating model in Europe in the early 1990s, its passenger volumes 
and scheduled passenger revenues have increased significantly because it has substantially increased capacity 
and demand has been sufficient to match the increased capacity. Ryanair's annual booked passenger volume has 
grown from approximately 945,000 passengers in the calendar year 1992 to approximately 75.8 million passengers 
in the 2012 fiscal year.

Body
 Any Significant Outbreak of any Airborne Disease, Including Swine Flu or Foot-and-Mouth Disease, Could 
Significantly Damage Ryanair's Business. Worldwide, there has, from time to time, been substantial publicity in 
recent years regarding certain potent influenza viruses and other disease epidemics. Publicity of this type may have 
a negative impact on demand for air travel in Europe. Past outbreaks of SARS, foot-and-mouth disease, avian flu 
and swine flu have adversely impacted the travel industries, including aviation, in certain regions of the world, 
including Europe. The Company believes that if any influenza or other pandemic becomes severe in Europe, its 
effect on demand for air travel in the markets in which Ryanair operates could be material, and it could therefore 
have a significantly adverse impact on the Company. A severe outbreak of swine flu, SARS, foot-and-mouth 
disease, avian flu or another pandemic or livestock-related disease also may result in European or national 
authorities imposing restrictions on travel, further damaging Ryanair's business. A serious pandemic could therefore 
severely disrupt Ryanair's business, resulting in the cancellation or loss of bookings, and adversely affecting 
Ryanair's financial condition and results of operations.
 Introduction of New or Increases in Existing Aviation Taxes Could Increase Costs. A number of European states, 
including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and Austria, currently impose taxes on air travel, often disguised 
as environmental taxes. Although the Netherlands reduced its aviation tax to zero in 2009 and Ireland reduced its 
tax from EUR10 to EUR3 in March 2011, due to government budgetary deficits these taxes may be reinstated in 
their previous or a new form. Further, other state governments or the European Union may introduce aviation 
taxation. Any such taxes would increase costs and could have a negative impact on demand for air travel. See also 
"-Environmental Regulation-Aviation Taxes" below.
 The Company is Dependent on the Continued Acceptance of Low-fares Airlines. In past years, accidents or other 
safety-related incidents involving certain low-fares airlines have had a negative impact on the public's acceptance of 
such airlines. Any adverse event potentially relating to the safety or reliability of low-fares airlines (including 
accidents or negative reports from regulatory authorities) could adversely impact the public's perception of, and 
confidence in, low-fares airlines like Ryanair, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial 
condition and results of operations.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -21-
 Terrorism in the United Kingdom or Elsewhere in Europe Could Have a Material Detrimental Effect on the 
Company. On August 10, 2006, U.K. security authorities arrested and subsequently charged eight individuals in 
connection with an alleged plot to attack aircraft operating on transatlantic routes. As a result of these arrests, U.K. 
authorities introduced increased security measures, which resulted in all passengers being body-searched, and a 
ban on the transportation in carry-on baggage of certain liquids and gels. The introduction of these measures led to 
passengers suffering severe delays while passing through these airport security checks. As a result, Ryanair 
cancelled 279 flights in the days following the incident and refunded a total of EUR2.7 million in fares to 
approximately 40,000 passengers. In the days following the arrests, Ryanair also suffered reductions in bookings 
estimated to have resulted in the loss of approximately EUR1.9 million of additional revenue. As in the past, the 
Company reacted to these adverse events by initiating system-wide fare sales to stimulate demand for air travel.
 In addition, reservations on Ryanair's flights to London dropped materially for a number of days in the immediate 
aftermath of the terrorist attacks in London on July 7, 2005. Although the terrorist attack in Glasgow on June 30, 
2007 and the failed terrorist attacks in London on July 21, 2005 and June 29, 2007 had no material impact on 
bookings, there can be no assurance that future such attacks will not affect passenger traffic. In the 2012 fiscal 
year, 16.0 million passengers were booked on Ryanair's flights into and out of London, representing 21.0% of the 
total passengers booked on all of the Company's flights in the fiscal year. Future acts of terrorism or significant 
terrorist threats, particularly in London or other markets that are significant to Ryanair, could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company's profitability or financial condition should the public's willingness to travel to and 
from those markets decline as a result. See also "-The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe 
Negative Impact on the International Airline Industry" below.
 The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact on the International Airline 
Industry. The terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, in which four commercial aircraft were 
hijacked, had a severe negative impact on the international airline industry, particularly on U.S. carriers and carriers 
operating international services to and from the United States. Although carriers such as Ryanair that operate 
primarily or exclusively in Europe were generally spared from such material adverse impacts on their businesses, 
the cost to all commercial airlines of insurance coverage for certain third-party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or 
terrorism increased dramatically after the September 11 attacks. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Insurance." In addition, Ryanair's insurers have indicated that the scope of the Company's current "act of war"-
related insurance may exclude certain types of catastrophic incidents, such as certain forms of biological, chemical 
or "dirty bomb" attacks. This could result in the Company's seeking alternative coverage, including government 
insurance or self-insurance, which could lead to further increases in costs. Although Ryanair to date has passed on 
increased insurance costs to passengers by means of a special "insurance levy" on each ticket, there can be no 
assurance that it will continue to be successful in doing so.
 Because a substantial portion of airline travel (both business and personal) is discretionary and because Ryanair is 
substantially dependent on discretionary air travel, any prolonged general reduction in airline passenger traffic may 
adversely affect the Company. Similarly, any significant increase in expenses related to security, insurance or 
related costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Any further terrorist attacks in the U.S. or in 
Europe, particularly in London or other markets that are significant to Ryanair, any significant military actions by the 
United States or EU nations or any related economic downturn may have a material adverse effect on demand for 
air travel and thus on Ryanair's business, operating results, and financial condition. See also "-Risks Related to the 
Company-Further Terrorist Attacks in London and Other Destinations Could Have a Detrimental Effect on the 
Company."
 The Company Faces the Risk of Loss and Liability. Ryanair is exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be 
incurred in the event of an aircraft accident or terrorist incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs 
related to the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from 
service. In addition, an accident or incident could result in significant legal claims against the Company from injured 
passengers and others who experienced injury or property damage as a result of the accident or incident, including 
ground victims. Ryanair currently maintains passenger liability insurance, employer liability insurance, aircraft 
insurance for aircraft loss or damage, and other business insurance in amounts per occurrence that are consistent 
with industry standards.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -21-
 Ryanair currently believes its insurance coverage is adequate (although not comprehensive). However, there can 
be no assurance that the amount of insurance coverage will not need to be increased, that insurance premiums will 
not increase significantly, or that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses from any accidents not 
covered by its insurance. Airline insurance costs increased dramatically following the September 2001 terrorist 
attacks on the United States. See "-The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact 
on the International Airline Industry" above. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of related 
insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial 
condition. Moreover, any aircraft accident, even if fully insured, could lead to the public perception that Ryanair's 
aircraft were less safe or reliable than those operated by other airlines, which could have a material adverse effect 
on Ryanair's business.
 EU Regulation No. 2027/97, as amended by Regulation No. 889/2002, governs air carrier liability. See "Item 4. 
Information on the Company-Insurance" for details of this regulation. This regulation increased the potential liability 
exposure of air carriers such as Ryanair. Although Ryanair has extended its liability insurance to meet the 
requirements of the regulation, no assurance can be given that other laws, regulations, or policies will not be 
applied, modified or amended in a manner that has a material adverse effect on Ryanair's business, operating 
results, and financial condition.

 levels. In May 2010 the BAA announced that it would not proceed with this GBP4 billion program.
 Ryanair announced on July 21, 2009 that, as a result of the U.K. government's then GBP10 APD tourist tax (as 
well as the then scheduled increase in APD from GBP10 to GBP11, which occurred in November 2009, from 
GBP11 to GBP12 which occurred in November 2010 and from GBP12 to GBP13 in April 2012) and the high costs 
of operating at its London (Stansted) base, it would implement a 40% reduction in capacity at such base between 
October 2009 and March 2010. In particular, the Company announced its intention to reduce its London (Stansted)-
based aircraft from the then current 40 to 24 during the aforementioned period, and also reduce by 30% the number 
of weekly Ryanair flights to and from the airport. The Company announced at that time that it expected these cuts to 
result in 2.5 million fewer passenger trips during the period. In addition, on June 29, 2010, due to the continuance of 
the U.K. government's GBP11 APD tourist tax and high charges at London (Stansted) airport, the Company 
announced that capacity at London (Stansted) airport would be reduced from winter 2010 by 17% and the number 
of aircraft based at London (Stansted) would be reduced to 22. Ryanair also noted that, as a result of other capacity 
reductions at its U.K. bases except for the bases at Edinburgh and Leeds Bradford, its total U.K. capacity fell by 
16% in the period from November 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011. See "Item 3. Risk Factors[3/4]Risks Related to the 
Company[3/4]Ryanair's Continued Growth is Dependent on Access to Suitable Airports; Charges for Airport Access 
are Subject to Increase." See also "Item 8. Financial Information[3/4]Other Financial Information[3/4]Legal 
Proceedings[3/4]EU State Aid-Related Proceedings" for information regarding legal proceedings in which Ryanair's 
economic arrangements with several publicly owned airports are being contested.
 FUEL
 The cost of jet fuel accounted for approximately 43% and 39% of Ryanair's total operating expenses in the fiscal 
years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively (in each case, this accounts for costs after giving effect to the 
Company's fuel hedging activities but excludes de-icing costs, which accounted for approximately 1% of total fuel 
costs in each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011). Jet fuel costs experienced substantial variance 
in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011.  The future availability and cost of jet fuel cannot be predicted 
with any degree of certainty, and Ryanair's low-fares policy limits its ability to pass on increased fuel costs to 
passengers through increased fares. Jet fuel prices are dependent on crude oil prices, which are quoted in U.S. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -29-
dollars. If the value of the U.S. dollar rises against the euro, Ryanair's fuel costs, expressed in euro, may increase 
even absent any increase in the U.S. dollar price of jet fuel. Ryanair has also entered into foreign currency forward 
contracts to hedge against some currency fluctuations. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exposure and Hedging."
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
Ryanair (like many other airlines) has, in more recent periods, entered into hedging arrangements on a much more 
selective basis. As of July 27, 2012, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering 
approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013 at prices equivalent to 
approximately $1,000 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 27, 2012, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet 
kerosene) contracts covering approximately 50% of its estimated requirements for the first half of the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 2014 at prices equivalent to approximately $935 per metric ton, and had not entered into any jet 
fuel hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that period. See "Item 3. Key Information-
Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's 
Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse Impact to the Company's Profitability" and "Item 11. Quantitative 
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Fuel Price Exposure and Hedging" for additional information on 
recent trends in fuel costs and the Company's related hedging activities, as well as certain associated risks. See 
also "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Fiscal Year 2012 Compared with Fiscal Year 2011-
Fuel and Oil."
 The following table details Ryanair's fuel consumption and costs for scheduled operations (i.e. it excludes costs 
related to de-icing and EU emissions trading costs) after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities for 
fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The excluded de-icing costs amounted to EUR9.3 million, 
EUR11.2 million and EUR11.6 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. De-
icing costs are costs incurred for the labor and anti-freeze used to de-ice aircraft. The excluded EU emissions 
trading costs amounted to EUR2.2 million, nil and nil, respectively for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 
and 2010.

 INSURANCE
 Ryanair is exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be incurred in the event of an aircraft 
accident or terrorist incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs related to the repair or 
replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from service. In 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -29-
addition, an accident or incident could result in significant legal claims against the Company from 
injured passengers and others who experienced injury or property damage as a result of the accident or 
incident, including ground victims. Ryanair maintains aviation third-party liability insurance, passenger 
liability insurance, employer liability insurance, directors and officers liability insurance, aircraft 
insurance for aircraft loss or damage, and other business insurance in amounts per occurrence consistent 
with industry standards. Ryanair believes its insurance coverage is adequate, although not comprehensive. 
There can be no assurance that the amount of such coverage will not need to be increased, that insurance 
premiums will not increase significantly or that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses 
from accidents. Ryanair's insurance does not cover claims for losses incurred when, due to unforeseen 
events, airspace is closed and aircraft are grounded, such as the airspace closures described on page 51, 
which resulted from volcanic ash in the northern European airspace during April and May 2010.
 The cost of insurance coverage for certain third-party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or 
terrorism increased dramatically as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In the immediate 
aftermath, aircraft liability war indemnities for amounts above $50 million were, in the absence of any 
alternative coverage, provided by the Irish Government at pre-September 11, 2001 levels of coverage on the 
basis of a per-passenger surcharge. In March 2002, once such coverage was again commercially available, 
Ryanair arranged coverage to replace that provided by the government indemnity. The replacement insurance 
coverage operated on the basis of a per-passenger surcharge with an additional surcharge based on hull 
values. Ryanair's insurers have indicated that the scope of the Company's current war-related insurance 
coverage may exclude certain types of catastrophic incidents, which may result in the Company seeking 
alternative coverage. Ryanair to date has passed increased insurance costs on to passengers by means of a 
special "insurance levy" on each ticket.

Commitments resulting from the use of derivative financial instruments by the Company are described in 
Notes 5 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
 Contingencies
 The Company is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. Management does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Company. Should the Company be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or financial position.
 In February 2004, the European Commission ruled that Ryanair had received illegal state aid from the 
Walloon regional government in connection with its establishment of a low cost base at Brussels 
(Charleroi). Ryanair advised the regional government that it believed no money was repayable as the cost 
of establishing the base exceeded the amount determined to be illegal state aid. Ryanair also appealed the 
decision of the European Commission to the European Court of First Instance ("CFI"), requesting that the 
Court annul the decision on the basis that Ryanair's agreement at Brussels (Charleroi) was consistent with 
agreements at similar privately owned airports and therefore did not constitute illegal state aid. The 
Company placed EUR4 million in an escrow account pending the outcome of this appeal. In December 2008, the 
CFI annulled the Commission's decision against Charleroi Airport and Ryanair was repaid the EUR4 million 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -91-
that the Commission had claimed was illegal state aid. A further action taken by the Belgian government 
for EUR2.3 million has also been withdrawn.
 Ryanair is facing similar legal challenges with respect to agreements with certain other airports, 
notably Lubeck, Berlin (Schonefeld), Tampere, Alghero, Pau, Aarhus, Frankfurt (Hahn), Niederrhein (Weeze), 
Zweibrucken, Altenburg, Klagenfurt, Vasteras, Paris (Beauvais), La Rochelle, Carcassonne, Nimes, 
Angouleme, Marseille and Brussels (Charleroi). In January 2010, the European commission concluded the 
Bratislava state aid investigation with a finding that Ryanair's agreement with Bratislava airport 
involved no aid. The remaining nineteen investigations involving Ryanair are ongoing and Ryanair currently 
expects that they will conclude within the next 12 months, with any European Commission's decisions 
appealable to the EU General Court.
 State aid complaints by Lufthansa about Ryanair's cost base at Frankfurt (Hahn) have been rejected by 
German courts, as have similar complaints by Air Berlin in relation to Ryanair's arrangement with Lubeck 
airport, but following a German Supreme Court ruling on a procedural issue in early 2011, these cases will 
be re-heard by lower courts. In addition, Ryanair has been involved in legal challenges including 
allegations of state aid at Alghero and Marseille airports. The Alghero case (initiated by Air One) was 
dismissed in its entirety in April 2011. The Marseille case was withdrawn by the plaintiffs (subsidiaries 
of Air France) in May 2011.
 The Company has also entered into a series of interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in 
interest rates for certain floating-rate financing arrangements. Cash deposits have been set aside as 
collateral for the counterparty's exposure to risk of fluctuations on long-term derivative and other 
financing arrangements with Ryanair (restricted cash) (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 
for further details). Additional numerical information on these swaps and on other derivatives held by the 
Company is set out in Notes 5 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

25           Dividends and Share buy-backs
 In August 2011, the Company bought back 27.0 million ordinary shares at a cost of EUR85.1 million.  In 
March 2012, the Company bought back a further 9.5 million ordinary shares at a cost of EUR39.5 million.  
Overall this is equivalent to approximately 2.5% of the Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary 
shares repurchased have been cancelled.  Accordingly, share capital decreased by 36.5 million ordinary 
shares with a nominal value of EUR0.2 million and the capital redemption reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.2 million.  The capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to 
preserve permanent capital in the parent Company. See note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for 
further details.
 On October 1, 2010, following shareholder approval at the Company's annual general meeting on September 
22, 2010, Ryanair Holdings plc paid a special dividend of EUR500 million, (33.57 euro cent per ordinary 
share), to shareholders.  Prior to effecting the dividend payment and in order to ensure that the parent 
company, Ryanair Holdings plc, had sufficient distributable profits to effect the dividend payment, on 
June 15, 2010, Ryanair Limited declared a dividend of EUR400 million to Ryanair Holdings plc.
 The Company announced on May 21, 2012 that it plans to pay a special dividend of EUR0.34 per ordinary 
share (approx EUR489 million) in November 2012 subject to shareholder approval at the annual general 
meeting on September 21, 2012.
 26           Post-balance sheet events
 On March 29, 2012, the Company agreed to buy back 15.0 million ordinary shares at a cost of EUR67.5 
million. This is equivalent to 1.0% of the issued share capital of the Company at March 31, 2012.  This 
trade settled in early April 2012 and the repurchased shares were cancelled.
 On June 19, 2012 Ryanair announced its intention to make an all cash offer of EUR1.30 per share for the 
entire issued share capital of Aer Lingus Group plc.

Body
 Ryanair Has Decided to Seasonally Ground Aircraft. In recent years, in response to an operating environment 
characterized by high fuel prices, typically lower winter yields and higher airport charges and/or taxes, Ryanair has 
adopted a policy of grounding a certain portion of its fleet during the winter months (from November to March). In 
the winter of fiscal year 2012, Ryanair grounded approximately 80 aircraft and the Company announced in May 
2012 that it intends to again ground approximately 80 aircraft during the coming winter.
 Ryanair's adoption of the policy of seasonally grounding aircraft presents some risks. While the Company seeks to 
implement its seasonal grounding policy in a way that will allow it to reduce losses by operating flights to high cost 
airports at low winter yields, there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful. Additionally, the 
Company's growth has been largely dependent on increasing capacity, and decreasing winter capacity may affect 
the overall future growth of the Company. Further, while seasonal grounding does reduce the Company's variable 
operating costs, it does not avoid fixed costs such as aircraft ownership costs and some staff costs, and it also 
decreases Ryanair's potential to earn ancillary revenues. Decreasing the number and frequency of flights may also 
negatively affect the Company's labor relations, including its ability to attract flight personnel interested in full-time 
employment. Such risks could lead to negative effects on the Company's financial condition and/or results of 
operations.
 Risks Associated with the Euro. Ryanair is headquartered in Ireland and its reporting currency is the euro. As a 
result of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the eurozone debt crisis, there has been widespread speculation that 
some member states could exit the euro or that there may be a potential break-up of the eurozone currency union, 
including with regard to Ireland, the country in which Ryanair is headquartered. If a eurozone participating member 
state were to leave the eurozone, there is a risk of contagion spreading to the remaining members. Ryanair 
predominantly operates to/from countries within the eurozone and has significant operational and financial 
exposures to the eurozone that could result in a reduction in the operating performance of the Company or the 
devaluation of certain assets.  See "Item 4 - Strategy for further information". The Company has taken certain risk 
management measures to minimise any disruptions, however these risk management measures may fail to address 
the potential fall-out from a break-up of the euro or an exit by one of the eurozone members.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -16-
 Ryanair has cash and aircraft assets and debt liabilities that are denominated in euro on its balance sheet. In 
addition the positive/negative mark-to-market on derivative based transactions are recorded in euro as either assets 
or liabilities on Ryanair's balance sheet. A potential exit of a member state or the break-up of the eurozone could 
have a materially adverse effect on the value of these assets and liabilities. In addition to the assets and liabilities 
on Ryanair's balance sheet, Ryanair has a number of cross currency risks as a result of the jurisdictions of the 
operating business including non-euro revenues, fuel costs, certain maintenance costs and insurance costs. A 
weakening in the value of the euro primarily against U.K. pound sterling and U.S. dollar but also against other non-
eurozone European currencies and Moroccan Dirhams, could negatively impact the operating results of the 
Company.
 Currency Fluctuations Affect the Company's Results. Although the Company is headquartered in Ireland, a 
significant portion of its operations is conducted in the U.K. Consequently, the Company has significant operating 
revenues and operating expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, denominated in U.K. pounds sterling. In 
addition, fuel, aircraft, insurance, and some maintenance obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars. The 
Company's results of operations and financial condition can therefore be significantly affected by fluctuations in the 
respective values of the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar. Ryanair is particularly subject to direct exchange 
rate risks between the euro and the U.S. dollar because a significant portion of its operating costs are incurred in 
U.S. dollars and none of its revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars.
 Although the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions between the euro and the U.S. dollar, 
between the euro and the U.K. pound sterling, and between the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, hedging 
activities cannot be expected to eliminate currency risks. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market Risk."
 The Company May Not Be Successful in Increasing Fares and Revenues to Offset Higher Business Costs. Ryanair 
operates a low-fares airline. The success of its business model depends on its ability to control costs so as to 
deliver low fares while at the same time earning a profit. The Company has limited control over its fuel costs and 
already has comparatively low other operating costs. In periods of high fuel costs, if the Company is unable to 
further reduce its other operating costs or generate additional revenues, operating profits are likely to fall. The 
Company cannot offer any assurances regarding its future profitability. See "-The Company Faces Significant Price 
and Other Pressures in a Highly Competitive Environment" below and "-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability 
Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Additional Losses" above.
 The Company is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports. Formal investigations are 
ongoing by the European Commission into Ryanair's agreements with the Lubeck, Berlin (Schonefeld), Alghero, 
Pau, Aarhus, Frankfurt (Hahn), Dusseldorf (Weeze), Zweibrucken, Altenburg, Klagenfurt, Stockholm (Vasteras), 
Paris (Beauvais), La Rochelle, Carcassonne, Nimes, Angouleme, Marseille and Brussels (Charleroi) airports. The 
investigations seek to determine whether the arrangements constitute illegal state aid. The investigations are 
expected to be completed in late 2012/early 2013, with the European Commission's decisions being appealable to 
the EU General Court. In addition to the European Commission investigations, Ryanair is facing allegations that it 
has benefited from unlawful state aid in a number of court cases, including in relation to its arrangements with 
Frankfurt (Hahn) and Lubeck airports. Adverse rulings in these matters could be used as precedents by competitors 
to challenge Ryanair's agreements with other publicly owned airports and could cause Ryanair to strongly 
reconsider its growth strategy in relation to public or state-owned airports across Europe. This could in turn lead to a 
scaling-back of Ryanair's overall growth strategy due to the smaller number of privately owned airports available for 
development.
 No assurance can be given as to the outcome of legal proceedings, nor as to whether any unfavorable outcomes 
may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the results of operation or financial condition 
of the Company. For additional information, please see "Item 8. Financial Information[3/4]Other Financial 
Information[3/4]Legal Proceedings."
 The Company Faces Significant Price and Other Pressures in a Highly Competitive Environment. Ryanair operates 
in a highly competitive marketplace, with a number of low-fare, traditional and charter airlines competing throughout 
the route network. Airlines compete primarily with respect to fare levels, frequency and dependability of service, 
name recognition, passenger amenities (such as access to frequent flyer programs), and the availability and 
convenience of other passenger services. Unlike Ryanair, certain of Ryanair's competitors are state-owned or state-
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -16-
controlled flag carriers and in some cases may have greater name recognition and resources and may have 
received, or may receive in the future, significant amounts of subsidies and other state aid from their respective 
governments. In addition, the EU-U.S. Open Skies Agreement, which entered into effect in March 2008, allows U.S. 
carriers to offer services in the intra-EU market, which should eventually result in increased competition. See "Item 
4. Information on the Company-Government Regulation-Liberalization of the EU Air Transportation Market."
 The airline industry is highly susceptible to price discounting, in part because airlines incur very low marginal costs 
for providing service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. Both low-fare and traditional airlines 
sometimes offer low fares in direct competition with Ryanair across a significant proportion of its route network as a 
result of the liberalization of the EU air transport market and greater public acceptance of the low-fares model.  
Although Ryanair's Yield per Available Seat Mile ("YASM") increased by approximately 10% in the 2012 fiscal year 
and by approximately 3% in the 2011 fiscal year, it decreased by approximately 13% in the 2010 fiscal year, and 
there can be no assurance that it will not decrease in future periods.
 Although Ryanair intends to compete vigorously and to assert its rights against any predatory pricing or other 
conduct, price competition among airlines could reduce the level of fares or passenger traffic on the Company's 
routes to the point where profitability may not be achievable.
 In addition to traditional competition among airline companies and charter operators who have entered the low-
fares market, the industry also faces competition from ground transportation (including high-speed rail systems) and 
sea transportation alternatives, as businesses and recreational travelers seek substitutes for air travel.

Body
 Pursuant to the Irish Aviation Authority (Nationality and Registration of Aircraft) Order 2002 (the 
"Order"), the IAA regulates the registration of aircraft in Ireland. In order to be registered or continue 
to be registered in Ireland, an aircraft must be wholly owned by either (i) a citizen of Ireland or a 
citizen of another member state of the EU having a place of residence or business in Ireland or (ii) a 
company registered in and having a place of business in Ireland and having its principal place of business 
in Ireland or another member state of the EU and not less than two-thirds of the directors of which are 
citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. As of the date of this report, seven of the nine 
directors of Ryanair Holdings are citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. An aircraft 
will also fulfill these conditions if it is wholly owned by such citizens or companies in combination. 
Notwithstanding the fact that these particular conditions may not be met, the IAA retains discretion to 
register an aircraft in Ireland so long as it is in compliance with the other conditions for registration 
under the Order. Any such registration may, however, be made subject to certain conditions. In order to be 
registered, an aircraft must also continue to comply with any applicable provisions of Irish law. The 
registration of any aircraft can be cancelled if it is found that it is not in compliance with the 
requirements for registration under the Order and, in particular: (i) if the ownership requirements are 
not met; (ii) if the aircraft has failed to comply with any applicable safety requirements specified by 
the IAA in relation to the aircraft or aircraft of a similar type; or (iii) if the IAA decides in any case 
that it is not in the public interest for the aircraft to remain registered in Ireland.
 Regulation of Competition
 Competition/Antitrust Law. It is a general principle of EU competition law that no agreement may be 
concluded between two or more separate economic undertakings that prevents, restricts or distorts 
competition in the common market or any part of the common market. Such an arrangement may nevertheless be 
exempted by the European Commission, on either an individual or category basis. The second general 
principle of EU competition law is that any business or businesses having a dominant position in the EU 
common market or any substantial part of the common market may not abuse such dominant position. Ryanair 
is subject to the application of the general rules of EU competition law as well as specific rules on 
competition in the airline sector.
 An aggrieved person may sue for breach of EU competition law in the courts of a member state and/or 
petition the European Commission for an order to put an end to the breach of competition law. The European 
Commission also may impose fines and daily penalties on businesses and the courts of the member states may 
award damages and other remedies (such as injunctions) in appropriate circumstances.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -32-
 Competition law in Ireland is primarily embodied in the Competition Act 2002. This Act is modeled on the 
EU competition law system. The Irish rules generally prohibit anti-competitive arrangements among 
businesses and prohibit the abuse of a dominant position. These rules are enforced either by public 
enforcement (primarily by the Competition Authority) through both criminal and civil sanctions or by 
private action in the courts. These rules apply to the airline sector, but are subject to EU rules that 
override any contrary provisions of Irish competition law. Ryanair has been subject to an abuse-of-
dominance investigation by the Irish Competition Authority in relation to service between Dublin and Cork. 
The Competition Authority closed its investigation in July 2009 with a finding in favor of Ryanair.
 State Aid. The EU rules control aid granted by member states to businesses on a selective or 
discriminatory basis. The EU Treaty prevents member states from granting such aid unless approved in 
advance by the EU. Any such grant of state aid to an airline is subject to challenge before the EU or, in 
certain circumstances, national courts. If aid is held to have been unlawfully granted it may have to be 
repaid by the airline to the granting member state, together with interest thereon. See "Item 3. Key 
Information[3/4]Risk Factors[3/4]Risks Related to the Company-The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings 
Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports" and "Item 8. Financial Information[3/4]Other Financial 
Information[3/4]Legal Proceedings."
 Environmental Regulation
 Aircraft Noise Regulations. Ryanair is subject to international, national and, in some cases, local noise 
regulation standards. EU and Irish regulations have required that all aircraft operated by Ryanair comply 
with Stage 3 noise requirements since April 1, 2002. All of Ryanair's aircraft currently comply with these 
regulations. Certain airports in the U.K. (including London Stansted and London Gatwick) and continental 
Europe have established local noise restrictions, including limits on the number of hourly or daily 
operations or the time of such operations.
 Company Facilities. Environmental controls are generally imposed under Irish law through property 
planning legislation, specifically the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts of 1963 to 1999, 
the Planning and Development Act 2000 and regulations made thereunder. At Dublin Airport, Ryanair operates 
on land controlled by the DAA. Planning permission for its facilities has been granted in accordance with 
both the zoning and planning requirements of Dublin Airport. There is also specific Irish environmental 
legislation implementing applicable EU directives and regulations, to which Ryanair adheres. From time to 
time, noxious or potentially toxic substances are held on a temporary basis within Ryanair's engineering 
facilities at Dublin Airport, Glasgow (Prestwick), London (Stansted), Frankfurt (Hahn), Stockholm 
(Skavsta), Oslo (Rygge) and Kaunas. However, at all times Ryanair's storage and handling of these 
substances complies with the relevant regulatory requirements. At Ryanair's Glasgow (Prestwick) and London 
(Stansted) maintenance facilities, all normal waste is removed in accordance with the Environmental 
Protection Act of 1996 and Duty of Care Waste Regulations. For special waste removal, Ryanair operates 
under the Special Waste Regulations 1998. At all other facilities Ryanair adheres to all local and EU 
regulations.
 Ryanair's Policy on Noise and Emissions. Ryanair is committed to reducing emissions and noise through 
investments in "next generation" aircraft and engine technologies and the implementation of certain 
operational and commercial decisions to minimize the environmental impact of its operations. According to 
the latest Air Travel Carbon and Energy Efficiency Report published by Brighter Planet, Ryanair is the 
industry leader in terms of environmental efficiency, and the Company is constantly working towards 
improving its performance.
 In December 2005, Ryanair completed the fleet replacement program it commenced in 1999. All of Ryanair's 
older Boeing 737-200A aircraft were replaced with Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, and Ryanair 
now operates a single-aircraft-type fleet of Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft with an average age 
of just over 3.8 years. The design of the new aircraft is aimed at minimizing drag, thereby reducing the 
rate of fuel burn and noise levels. The engines are also quieter and more fuel-efficient. Furthermore, by 
moving to an all Boeing 737-800 "next generation" fleet, Ryanair reduced the unit emissions per passenger 
due to the inherent capacity increase in the Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The Boeing 737-800 "next generation" 
aircraft have a significantly superior fuel-burn to passenger-kilometer ratio than Ryanair's former fleet 
of Boeing 737-200A aircraft. See "-Aircraft" above for details on Ryanair's fleet plan.
 Ryanair has also installed winglets on all of its existing aircraft and all future aircraft will also be 
fitted with winglets. Winglets reduce both the rate of fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions by 
approximately 4% and also reduce noise emissions.
 In addition, Ryanair has distinctive operational characteristics that management believes are helpful to 
the general environment. In particular, Ryanair:
 --      operates with a high-seat density of 189 seats and an all-economy configuration, as opposed to 
the 162 seats and two-class configuration of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft used by traditional network 
airlines, reducing fuel burn and emissions per seat-kilometer flown;
 --      has reduced per-passenger emissions through higher load factors;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -32-
 --      better utilizes existing infrastructure by operating out of underutilized secondary and regional 
airports throughout Europe, which limits the use of holding patterns and taxiing times, thus reducing fuel 
burn and emissions and reducing the need for new airport infrastructure;
 --      provides direct services as opposed to connecting flights, in order to limit the need for 
passengers to transfer at main hubs and thus reduces the number of take-offs and landings per journey from 
four to two, reducing fuel burn and emissions per journey; and
 --      has no late-night departures of aircraft, reducing the impact of noise emissions.

 Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Employees and Labor Relations." Limitations on Ryanair's flexibility 
in dealing with its employees or the altering of the public's perception of Ryanair generally could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, and financial condition.
 The Company is Dependent on External Service Providers. Ryanair currently assigns its engine overhauls and 
"rotable" repairs to outside contractors approved under the terms of Part 145, the European regulatory standard for 
aircraft maintenance established by the European Aviation Safety Agency ("Part 145"). The Company also assigns 
its passenger, aircraft and ground handling services at airports other than Dublin and certain airports in Spain and 
the Canary Islands to established external service providers. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-

 The termination or expiration of any of Ryanair's service contracts or any inability to renew them or negotiate 
replacement contracts with other service providers at comparable rates could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company's results of operations. Ryanair will need to enter into airport service agreements in any new markets it 
enters, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain the necessary facilities and services at 
competitive rates. In addition, although Ryanair seeks to monitor the performance of external parties that provide 
passenger and aircraft handling services, the efficiency, timeliness, and quality of contract performance by external 
providers are largely beyond Ryanair's direct control. Ryanair expects to be dependent on such outsourcing 
arrangements for the foreseeable future.
 The Company is Dependent on Key Personnel. The Company's success depends to a significant extent upon the 
efforts and abilities of its senior management team, including Michael O'Leary, the Chief Executive Officer, and key 
financial, commercial, operating and maintenance personnel. Mr. O'Leary's current contract may be terminated by 
either party upon 12 months' notice. See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Compensation of 
Directors and Senior Management-Employment Agreements." The Company's success also depends on the ability 
of its executive officers and other members of senior management to operate and manage effectively, both 
independently and as a group. Although the Company's employment agreements with Mr. O'Leary and some of its 
other senior executives contain non-competition and non-disclosure provisions, there can be no assurance that 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -19-
these provisions will be enforceable in whole or in part. Competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and 
either the loss of any executive officer, senior manager, or other key employee without adequate replacement or the 
inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, 
operating results, and financial condition.
 The Company Faces Risks Related to its Internet Reservations Operations and its Announced Elimination of 
Airport Check-in Facilities. Approximately 99% of Ryanair's flight reservations are made through its website. 
Although the Company has established a contingency program whereby the website is hosted in three separate 
locations, each of these locations accesses the same booking engine, located at a single center, in order to make 
reservations.
 A back-up booking engine is available to Ryanair to support its existing platform in the event of a breakdown in this 
facility. Nonetheless, the process of switching over to the back-up engine could take some time and there can be no 
assurance that Ryanair would not suffer a significant loss of reservations in the event of a major breakdown of its 
booking engine or other related systems, which, in turn, could have a material adverse affect on the Company's 
operating results or financial condition.
 Since October 1, 2009, all passengers have been required to use Internet check-in. Internet check-in is part of a 
package of measures intended to reduce check-in lines and passenger handling costs and pass on these savings 
by reducing passenger airfares. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Reservations/Ryanair.com." The 
Company has deployed this system across its network. Any disruptions to the Internet check-in service as a result 
of a breakdown in the relevant computer systems or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on these 
service-improvement and cost-reduction efforts. The result of this requirement is that Ryanair has reduced airport 
and handling costs, due to the need to have fewer check-in personnel and rented check-in desks. There can be no 
assurance, however, that this process will continue to be successful or that consumers will not switch to other 
carriers that provide standard check-in facilities, which would negatively affect the Company's results of operations 
and financial condition.
 The Company Faces Risks Related to Unauthorized Use of Information from the Company's Website. 
Screenscraper websites gain unauthorized access to Ryanair's website and booking system, extract flight and 
pricing information and display it on their own websites for sale to customers at prices which include intermediary 
fees on top of Ryanair's fares. Ryanair does not allow any such commercial use of its website and objects to the 
practice of screenscraping also on the basis of certain legal principles, such as database rights, copyright 
protection, etc. In November 2011, the Company introduced Captcha, a Google product which requires passengers 
who wish to book flights to enter a screen code to complete their bookings.  This has had a positive impact and 
reduced the level of screenscraping.  The Company is also involved in a number of legal proceedings against the 
proprietors of screenscraper websites in Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland. 
The Company's objective is to prevent any unauthorized use of its website, however the Company does allow 
certain companies who operate fare comparison websites to access the website provided they sign a license and 
use the agreed method to access the data.  The Company has received favorable rulings in Ireland, Germany and 
The Netherlands. However, pending the outcome of these legal proceedings and if Ryanair were to be unsuccessful 
in them, the activities of screenscraper websites could lead to a reduction in the number of customers who book 
directly on Ryanair's website and consequently in a reduction in the Company's ancillary revenue stream. Also, 
some customers may be lost to the Company once they are presented by a screenscraper website with a Ryanair 
fare inflated by the screenscraper's intermediary fee. This could also adversely affect Ryanair's reputation as a low-
fares airline, which could negatively affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. For 
additional details, see "Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial Information-Legal Proceedings-Legal 
Proceedings Against Internet Ticket Touts."
 Irish Corporation Tax Rate Could Rise. The majority of Ryanair's profits are subject to Irish corporation tax at a 
statutory rate of 12.5%. Due to the size and scale of the Irish government's budgetary deficit and the "bailout" of the 
Irish government by a combination of loans from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, there is 
a risk that the Irish government could increase Irish corporation tax rates above 12.5% in order to repay current or 
future loans or to increase tax revenues.
 At 12.5%, the rate of Irish corporation tax is lower than that applied by most of the other European Union member 
states, and has periodically been subject to critical comment by the governments of other EU member states. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -19-
Although the Irish government has repeatedly publicly stated that it will not increase corporation tax rates, there can 
be no assurance that such an increase in corporation tax rates will not occur.
 In the event that the Irish government increases corporation tax rates or changes the basis of calculation of 
corporation tax from the present basis, any such changes would result in Ryanair paying higher corporate taxes and 
would have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial position and results of operations. See "-Risks Related 
to the Company-Tax audits."
 Change in EU Regulations in Relation to Employers and Employee Social Insurance Could Increase Costs.
 The European Parliament passed legislation governing the payment of employee and employer social insurance 
costs in May, 2012. The legislation was introduced in late June 2012. The legislation governs the country in which 
employees and employers must pay social insurance costs. Presently, Ryanair pays employee and employer social 
insurance in the country under whose laws the employee's contract of employment is governed, which is at this 
time either the UK or Ireland. Under the terms of this new legislation, employees and employers must pay social 
insurance in the country where the employee is based. The legislation includes grandfathering rights which means 
that existing employees should be exempt.  However, both new and existing employees who transfer from their 
present base location to a new base in another EU country will be impacted by the new rules in relation to 
employee and employer contributions. Each country within the EU has different rules and rates in relation to the 
calculation of employee and employer social insurance contributions.  Ryanair estimates that the change in 
legislation will not have any initial material impact on salary costs although it could have an adverse impact over 
time.

 Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by 
an individual prior to January 1, 2013 with respect to the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will be subject to taxation at a 
maximum rate of 15% if the dividends are "qualified dividends." Dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will 
be treated as qualified dividends if (i) the issuer is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with 
the United States that the Internal Revenue Service has approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules 
and (ii) the Company was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in 
which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (a "PFIC"). The income tax treaty between 
Ireland and the United States has been approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules. Based on the 
Company's audited financial statements and relevant market data, the Company believes that it was not treated as 
a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2011/12 taxable year. In addition, based on the 
Company's audited financial statements and its current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, 
the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market data, the Company does not anticipate becoming a PFIC 
for its 2012/13 taxable year.
 Under the U.S.-Ireland Income Tax Treaty currently in effect, in the event the Company were to pay any dividend, 
the tax credit attaching to the dividend (as used herein the "Tax Credit"; see "-Irish Tax Considerations") generally 
will be treated as a foreign income tax eligible for credit against such U.S. Holder's United States federal income tax 
liability, subject to generally applicable limitations and conditions. Any such dividend paid by the Company to such 
U.S. Holder will constitute income from sources outside the United States for foreign tax credit purposes, and 
generally will constitute "passive category" income for such purposes.
 Foreign tax credits may not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term or hedged 
positions in securities.
 U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the implications of these rules in light of their 
particular circumstances.
 Distributions of Ordinary Shares that are made as part of a pro rata distribution to all stockholders generally will not 
be subject to U.S. federal income tax.
 Taxation of Capital Gains
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -56-
 Sale or Disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs. Gains or losses realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other 
disposition of ADRs generally will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as capital gains or losses, which 
generally will be long-term capital gains or losses if the ADRs have been held for more than one year. The net 
amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder before January 1, 2013 generally is subject to 
taxation at a maximum rate of 15%. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
 Deposits and withdrawals of Ordinary Shares by U.S. Holders in exchange for ADRs will not result in the realization 
of gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 Non-U.S. Holders. A holder of Ordinary Shares or ADRs that is, with respect to the United States, a foreign 
corporation or a nonresident alien individual (a "Non-U.S. Holder") generally will not be subject to U.S. federal 
income or withholding tax on dividends received on such Ordinary Shares or ADRs unless such income is 
effectively connected with the conduct by such holder of a trade or business in the United States. A Non-U.S. 
Holder of ADRs or Ordinary Shares will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax in respect of 
gain realized on the sale or other disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless (i) such gain is effectively 
connected with the conduct by such holder of a trade or business in the United States or (ii) in the case of gain 
realized by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, such Non-U.S. Holder is present in the United States for 183 days or 
more in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are met.

 Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 GENERAL
 Ryanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and currency 
exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimize the negative impact of 
commodity price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company's earnings, cash flows and 
equity.
 To manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial instruments, including cross currency interest rate 
swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and commodity forwards. These derivative financial instruments are 
generally held to maturity and are not actively traded. The Company enters into these arrangements with the goal of 
hedging its operational and balance sheet risk. However, Ryanair's exposure to commodity price, interest rate and 
currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot be neutralized completely.
 In executing its risk management strategy, Ryanair currently enters into forward contracts for the purchase of some 
of the jet fuel (jet kerosene) that it expects to use. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts intended to reduce 
its exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, it enters into interest rate 
contracts with the objective of fixing certain borrowing costs and hedging principal repayments, particularly those 
associated with the purchase of new Boeing 737-800s. Ryanair is also exposed to the risk that the counterparties to 
its derivative financial instruments may not be creditworthy. Were a counterparty to default on its obligations under 
any of the instruments described below, Ryanair's economic expectations when entering into these arrangements 
might not be achieved and its financial condition could be adversely affected. Transactions involving derivative 
financial instruments are also relatively illiquid as compared with those involving other kinds of financial instruments. 
It is Ryanair's policy not to enter into transactions involving financial derivatives for speculative purposes.
 The following paragraphs describe Ryanair's fuel hedging, foreign currency and interest rate swap arrangements 
and analyze the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of the financial instruments to hypothetical 
changes in commodity prices, interest rates and exchange rates as if these changes had occurred at March 31, 
2012. The range of changes selected for this sensitivity analysis reflects Ryanair's view of the changes that are 
reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -56-
 FUEL PRICE EXPOSURE AND HEDGING
 Fuel costs constitute a substantial portion of Ryanair's operating expenses (approximately 43.0% and 39.1% of 
such expenses in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, after taking into account Ryanair's fuel hedging 
activities). Ryanair engages in fuel price hedging transactions from time to time, pursuant to which Ryanair and a 
counterparty agree to exchange payments equal to the difference between a fixed price for a given quantity of jet 
fuel and the market price for such quantity of jet fuel at a given date in the future, with Ryanair receiving the amount 
of any excess of such market price over such fixed price and paying to the counterparty the amount of any deficit of 
such fixed price under such market price.
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
Ryanair (like many other airlines) has, in more recent periods, entered into hedging arrangements on a much more 
selective basis. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs 
and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increases the Likelihood that the Company May Incur 
Losses" and "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks-Fuel Price Exposure and 
Hedging" for additional information on recent trends in fuel costs and the Company's related hedging activities, as 
well as certain associated risks. See also "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Fiscal Year 2012 
Compared with Fiscal Year 2011-Fuel and Oil." As of July 27, 2012, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet 
kerosene) contracts covering approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 
2013 at prices equivalent to approximately $1,000 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 27, 2012, Ryanair had 
entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering approximately 50% of its estimated requirements for 
the first half of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014 at prices equivalent to approximately $935 per metric ton, and 
had not entered into any jet fuel hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that period.

Body
 During the 2006 fiscal year, Ryanair established Aviation Insurance (IOM) Limited ("AIL"), a wholly owned 
insurance company subsidiary, to provide the Company with self-insurance as part of its ongoing risk-management 
strategy. AIL underwrites a portion of the Company's aviation insurance program, which covers not only the 
Company's aircraft but also its liability to passengers and to third parties. AIL reinsures virtually all of the aviation 
insurance risk it underwrites with recognized third parties in the aviation reinsurance market, with the amount of 
AIL's maximum aggregate exposure not currently subject to such reinsurance agreements being equal to 
approximately $16.5 million. In addition to aviation insurance, AIL has underwritten most of the single trip travel 
insurance policies sold on Ryanair.com since February 1, 2011.
 Council Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002, governs air carrier 
liability. This legislation provides for unlimited liability of an air carrier in the event of death or bodily injuries suffered 
by passengers, implementing the Warsaw Convention of 1929 for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to 
Transportation by Air, as amended by the Montreal Convention of 1999. Ryanair has extended its liability insurance 
to meet the appropriate requirements of the legislation. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Airline Industry-The Company Faces the Risk of Loss and Liability" for information on the Company's risks of 
loss and liability.

Ryanair has agreements with the DAA, the Irish government authority charged with operating Dublin Airport, 
to lease bag-drop counters and other space at the passenger and cargo terminal facilities at Dublin 
Airport. The airport office facilities used by Ryanair at London (Stansted) are leased from the airport 
authority; similar facilities at each of the other airports Ryanair serves are provided by Servisair plc 
or other service providers.
 TRADEMARKS
 Ryanair's logo and the slogans "Ryanair.com The Low Fares Website" and "Ryanair The Low Fares Airline" 
have been registered as Community Trade Marks ("CTMs"). Ryanair has also registered the CTM for the word 
"Ryanairhotels.com." A CTM allows a trademark owner to obtain a single registration of its trademark, 
which registration affords uniform protection for that trademark in all EU member states. The registration 
gives Ryanair an exclusive monopoly over the use of its trade name with regard to similar services and the 
right to sue for trademark infringement should another party use an identical or confusingly similar 
trademark in relation to identical, or similar services.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -30-
 Ryanair has not registered either its name or its logo as a trademark in Ireland, as CTM-registration 
provides all of the protection available from an Irish registration, and management believes there are 
therefore no advantages in making a separate Irish application.
 Ryanair's trademarks include:
 -       Community (Word) Trade Mark registration number 004168721 comprised of the word "Ryanair" in 
classes 16, 28, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 42 (Nice Classification);
 -       Community (Figurative) Trade Mark registration number 001493329 comprising the following graphic 
representation:
 in classes 16, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 42 (Nice Classification) and class 27.5.1 (Vienna classification);
 -       Community (Figurative) Trade Mark registration number 00446559 comprising the following graphic 
representation:
 in classes 16, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 42 (Nice Classification) and class 22.1.16 (Vienna classification);

 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 Liberalization of the EU Air Transportation Market
 Ryanair began its flight operations in 1985, during a decade in which the governments of Ireland and the 
U.K. liberalized the bilateral arrangements for the operation of air services between the two countries. 
In 1992, the Council of Ministers of the EU adopted a package of measures intended to liberalize the 
internal market for air transportation in the EU. The liberalization included measures that allow EU air 
carriers substantial freedom to set air fares, provided EU air carriers greatly enhanced access to routes 
within the EU, and also introduced a licensing procedure for EU air carriers. Beginning in April 1997, EU 
air carriers have generally been able to provide passenger services on domestic routes within any EU 
member state outside their home country of operations without restriction. See also "[3/4]Industry 
Overview[3/4]European Airline Market."
 Regulatory Authorities
 Ryanair is subject to Irish and EU regulation, which is implemented primarily by the Department of 
Transport, the IAA, the European Commission, and the EASA. Management believes that the present regulatory 
environment in Ireland and the EU is characterized by high sensitivity to safety and security issues, 
which is demonstrated by intensive reviews of safety-related procedures, training, and equipment by the 
national and EU regulatory authorities.
 Commission for Aviation Regulation. The CAR is currently primarily responsible for deciding maximum 
airport charges only at Dublin Airport. See "[3/4]Airport Operations[3/4]Airport Charges" above.
 The CAR also has responsibility for licensing Irish airlines, subject to the requirements of EU law. It 
issues operating licenses under the provisions of EU Regulation 1008/2008 (formerly 2407/92). An operating 
license is an authorization permitting the holder to transport passengers, mail and/or cargo by air. The 
criteria for granting an operating license include, inter alia, an air carrier's financial fitness, the 
adequacy of its insurance, and the fitness of the persons who will manage the air carrier. In addition, in 
order to obtain and maintain an operating license, Irish and EU regulations require that (i) the air 
carrier must be owned and continue to be owned directly or through majority ownership by EU member states 
and/or nationals of EU member states and (ii) the air carrier must at all times be effectively controlled 
by such EU member states or EU nationals. The CAR has broad authority to revoke an operating license. See 
"Item 10. Additional Information--Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals." See also "Item 3.

 Aircraft rentals. Aircraft rental expenses amounted to EUR90.7 million in the 2012 fiscal year, a 6.7% decrease 
from the EUR97.2 million reported in the 2011 fiscal year, reflecting the lower lease costs on newer aircraft and the 
handback of 3 aircraft due to the maturity of leases.
 Route charges and airport and handling charges. Ryanair's route charges per ASM decreased 0.1% in the 2012 
fiscal year, while airport and handling charges per ASM increased 0.3%. In absolute terms, route charges increased 
12.2%, from EUR410.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR460.5 million in the 2012 fiscal year, primarily as a 
result of the 5.8% increase in sectors flown. In absolute terms, airport and handling charges increased 12.6%, from 
EUR491.8 million in the 2011 fiscal year, to EUR554.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, reflecting the overall growth in 
passenger volumes and higher charges at Dublin and Stansted airports, partially offset by lower average costs at 
Ryanair's newer airports and bases.
 Marketing, distribution and other expenses. Ryanair's marketing, distribution and other operating expenses, 
including those applicable to the generation of ancillary revenues, decreased 4.0% on a per-ASM basis in the 2012 
fiscal year, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 7.8%, from EUR167.0 million in the 2011 fiscal year to 
EUR180.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, with the overall increase primarily reflecting the higher level of activity and 
increased onboard product costs reflecting the higher level of sales.
 Operating profit. As a result of the factors outlined above, operating profit increased 24.6% on a per-ASM basis in 
the 2012 fiscal year, and also increased in absolute terms, from EUR488.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year to 
EUR683.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Ryanair Has Decided to 
Seasonally Ground Aircraft. The Company's decision to ground aircraft did not have a material impact on the results 
of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2012 and, at present, is not anticipated to have a material impact on 
future operations. The Company anticipates that any revenues which could have been generated had the Company 
operated the grounded aircraft, would have been lower than the operating costs associated with operating these 
aircraft, due to significantly higher fuel costs, airport charges and taxes. The Company does not anticipate that any 
material staff costs will be incurred during future periods of the grounding of aircraft, as the relevant staff can be 
furloughed under the terms of their contract without compensation and the maintenance costs associated with the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -38-
grounded aircraft will be minimal. However, the Company will still incur aircraft ownership costs comprised of 
depreciation and amortization costs, lease rentals costs and financing costs.
 Finance income. Ryanair's interest and similar income increased 62.5%, from EUR27.2 million in the 2011 fiscal 
year to EUR44.3 million in the 2012 fiscal year reflecting the improved yield on term deposits.
 Finance expense. Ryanair's interest and similar charges increased 16.3%, from EUR93.9 million in the 2011 fiscal 
year to EUR109.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year, primarily due to higher interest rates in the 2012 fiscal year 
compared to the 2011 fiscal year. These costs are expected to increase as Ryanair further expands its fleet.
 Foreign exchange gains/losses.Ryanair recorded foreign exchange gains of EUR4.3 million in the 2012 fiscal year, 
as compared with foreign exchange losses of EUR0.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year, with the different result being 
primarily due to the weakening of the euro against the U.K. pound sterling during the 2012 fiscal year.
 Taxation. The effective tax rate for the 2012 fiscal year was 11.5%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 11.0% 
in the 2011 fiscal year. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory rate of Irish corporation tax of 12.5%. Ryanair 
recorded an income tax provision of EUR72.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year, compared with a tax provision of 
EUR46.3 million in the 2011 fiscal year, with the increase primarily reflecting higher pre-tax profits. The 
determination regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset was based on future income forecasts, which 
demonstrated that it was more likely than not that future profits would be available in order to utilize the deferred tax 
asset. A deferred tax asset's recoverability is not dependent on material improvements over historical levels of pre-
tax income, material changes in the present relationship between income reported for financial and tax purposes, or 
material asset sales or other non-routine transactions.
 FISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2010
 Profit after taxation. Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR374.6 million in the 2011 
fiscal year, as compared with a profit of EUR305.3 million in the 2010 fiscal year. This profit was primarily 
attributable to an increase in revenues driven by a 12.3% increase in average fares and a 20.8% increase in 
ancillary revenues, partially offset by a 37.3% increase in fuel and oil costs from EUR893.9 million to EUR1,227.0 
million.
 Scheduled revenues. Ryanair's scheduled passenger revenues increased 21.6%, from EUR2,324.5 million in the 
2010 fiscal year, to EUR2,827.9 million in the 2011 fiscal year, primarily reflecting an increase of 12.3% in average 
fares. The number of passengers booked increased 8.4%, from 66.5 million to 72.1 million, reflecting increased 
scheduled passenger volumes on existing passenger routes and the successful launch of new bases at  Barcelona 
(El Prat), Gran Canaria, Kaunas, Lanzarote, Malta, Seville, Tenerife and Valencia in the 2011 fiscal year. There was 
a one-percentage-point increase in booked passenger load factors from 82% in the 2010 fiscal year to 83% in the 
2011 fiscal year.
 Passenger capacity (as measured in ASMs) during the 2011 fiscal year increased by 18.5% due to the addition of 
40 Boeing 737-800 aircraft (net of disposals), as well as a 7.8% increase in sectors flown and a 9.9% increase in 
the average length of passenger haul. Scheduled passenger revenues accounted for 77.9% of Ryanair's total 
revenues for the 2011 fiscal year, compared with 77.8% of total revenues in the 2010 fiscal year.
 Ancillary revenues. Ryanair's ancillary revenues, which comprise revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, 
in-flight sales and Internet-related services, increased 20.8%, from EUR663.6 million in the 2010 fiscal year to 
EUR801.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year, while ancillary revenues per booked passenger increased to EUR11.12 
from EUR9.98. Revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, including revenues from excess baggage charges, 
debit and credit card transactions, sales of rail and bus tickets, accommodations, travel insurance and car rental 
increased 16.3% to EUR574.2 million from EUR493.5 million in the 2010 fiscal year. Revenues from in-flight sales 
increased 16.4%, to EUR100.7 million from EUR86.5 million in the 2010 fiscal year. Revenues from Internet-related 
services, primarily commissions received from products sold on Ryanair.com or linked websites, increased 51.5%, 
from EUR83.6 million in the 2010 fiscal year to EUR126.7 million in the 2011 fiscal year. The rate of increase in 
revenues from all ancillary revenue categories exceeded the increase in overall passengers booked.
 The following table sets forth the components of ancillary revenues earned by Ryanair and each component 
expressed as a percentage of total ancillary revenues for each of the periods indicated:

Operating expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, Ryanair's operating expenses remained unchanged at 
86.5% in the 2011 fiscal year as compared to the 2010 fiscal year, as the impact of the increase in total revenues 
was offset by a corresponding increase in operating expenses. In absolute terms, total operating expenses 
increased 21.5%, from EUR2,586.0 million in the 2010 fiscal year to EUR3,141.30 million in the 2011 fiscal year, 
principally as a result of a 37.3% increase in fuel costs from EUR893.9 million in the 2010 fiscal year to EUR1,227.0 
million in the 2011 fiscal year. Staff costs, depreciation and amortization maintenance expenses, aircraft rental 
expenses, route charges, airport handling charges and marketing, distribution and other costs decreased as a 
percentage of total revenues, while fuel and oil increased. Total operating expenses per ASM increased by 2.5%, 
with the increase reflecting, principally the increase in passenger capacity (as measured in ASMs) during the 2011 
fiscal year and the impact of the higher fuel costs.

 1              Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the 2012 
fiscal year are set out below. These have been applied consistently for all periods presented, except as 
otherwise stated.
 Business activity
 Ryanair Limited and its subsidiaries ("Ryanair Limited") has operated as an international airline since 
commencing operations in 1985. On August 23, 1996, Ryanair Holdings Limited, a newly formed holding 
company, acquired the entire issued share capital of Ryanair Limited. On May 16, 1997, Ryanair Holdings 
Limited re-registered as a public limited company, Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company"). Ryanair Holdings 
plc and its subsidiaries are hereafter together referred to as "Ryanair Holdings plc" (or "we", "our", 
"us", "Ryanair" or the "Company") and currently operate a low-fares airline headquartered in Dublin, 
Ireland. All trading activity continues to be undertaken by the group of companies headed by Ryanair 
Limited.
 Statement of compliance
 In accordance with the International Accounting Standards ("IAS") Regulation (EC 1606 (2002)) which 
applies throughout the European Union ("EU"), the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(collectively "IFRS") as adopted by the EU, which are effective for the year ended and as at March 31, 
2012. In addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted by the EU, the 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"). The consolidated financial statements have also been 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012.
 Details of legislative changes and new accounting standards or amendments to accounting standards, which 
are not yet effective and have not been early adopted in these consolidated financial statements, and the 
likely impact on future financial statements are set forth below in the prospective accounting changes 
section.
 New accounting standards adopted during the year
 There were no new standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards adopted for the first 
time during the year ended March 31, 2012, which had a material impact on our financial position or 
results from operations.
 Basis of preparation
 These consolidated financial statements are presented in euro millions, the euro being the functional 
currency of the parent entity and the majority of the group companies. They are prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale securities which are stated 
at fair value, and share-based payments, which are based on fair value determined as at the grant date of 
the relevant share options. Certain non-current assets classified as held for sale are stated at the lower 
of cost and fair value less costs to sell.

 The following table sets forth the amounts in euro cent of, and percentage changes in, Ryanair's operating 
expenses (on a per-ASM basis) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and March 31, 2010 under IFRS. These 
data are calculated by dividing the relevant expense amount (as shown in the consolidated financial statements) by 
the number of ASMs in the relevant year as shown in the table of "Selected Operating and Other Data" in Item 3 
and rounding to the nearest euro cent; the percentage change is calculated on the basis of the relevant figures 
before rounding.

 ============  ============  =========
Staff costs. Ryanair's staff costs, which consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits, decreased 5.1% on a per-
ASM basis, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 12.3%, from EUR335.0 million in the 2010 fiscal year to 
EUR376.1 million in the 2011 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a 14.7% 
increase in average headcount to 8,069, which was partially offset by the impact of a Company-wide pay freeze 
then in effect, the higher proportion of contract crew operating during the year, and the rise, during the year, in the 
proportion of cabin crew members who earn below-average salaries. Employee numbers rose due to the growth of 
the business.
 Depreciation and amortization.Ryanair's depreciation and amortization per ASM decreased by 0.4%, while in 
absolute terms these costs increased 18.0% from EUR235.4 million in the 2010 fiscal year, to EUR277.7 million in 
the 2011 fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of 44 owned aircraft (net of disposals) to 
the fleet during the 2011 fiscal year. See "-Critical Accounting Policies-Long-lived Assets" above.
 Fuel and oil. Ryanair's fuel and oil costs per ASM increased by 16.0%, while in absolute terms, these costs 
increased by 37.3% from EUR893.9 million in the 2010 fiscal year to EUR1,227.0 million in the 2011 fiscal year, in 
each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities. The 37.3% increase reflected a 15.8% 
increase in average fuel prices paid, the impact of a 17.4% increase in the number of hours flown and a 9.9% 
increase in the average sector length. Fuel and oil costs include the direct cost of fuel, the cost of delivering fuel to 
the aircraft, and aircraft de-icing costs.  The average fuel price paid by Ryanair (calculated by dividing total fuel 
costs by the number of U.S. gallons of fuel consumed) increased 15.8% from EUR1.52 per U.S. gallon in the 2010 
fiscal year to EUR1.76 per U.S. gallon in the 2011 fiscal year, in each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel 
hedging activities.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs. Ryanair's maintenance, materials and repair expenses, which consist primarily 
of the cost of routine maintenance and the overhaul of spare parts, decreased 7.3% on a per-ASM basis, while in 
absolute terms these expenses increased by 9.2% from EUR86.0 million in the 2010 fiscal year to EUR93.9 million 
in the 2011 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms during the fiscal year reflected the additional costs arising 
from increased line maintenance activity at new bases and costs incurred to satisfy provisions of lease contracts 
dealing with the condition of aircraft due to be returned in 2010 and 2011.
 Aircraft rentals. Aircraft rental expenses amounted to EUR97.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year, a 1.8% increase from 
the EUR95.5 million reported in the 2010 fiscal year, reflecting the net impact of the return of ten aircraft under 
operating lease and the addition of six aircraft leased during the year.
 Route charges and airport and handling charges. Ryanair's route charges per ASM increased 2.9% in the 2011 
fiscal year, while airport and handling charges per ASM decreased 9.7%. In absolute terms, route charges 
increased 22.1%, from EUR336.3 million in the 2010 fiscal year to EUR410.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year, 
primarily as a result of the 8.3% increase in sectors flown. In absolute terms, airport and handling charges 
increased 7.1%, from EUR459.1 million in the 2010 fiscal year, to EUR491.8 million in the 2011 fiscal year, 
reflecting the overall growth in passenger volumes, partially offset by lower average costs at Ryanair's newer 
airports and bases.
 Marketing, distribution and other expenses. Ryanair's marketing, distribution and other operating expenses, 
including those applicable to the generation of ancillary revenues, decreased 2.4% on a per-ASM basis in the 2011 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -39-
fiscal year, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 15.3%, from EUR144.8 million in the 2010 fiscal year to 
EUR167.0 million in the 2011 fiscal year, with the overall increase primarily reflecting the higher level of activity and 
increase in airport commissions on revenues generated.
 Icelandic ash related costs. The closure of European airspace in April and May 2010, due to the Icelandic volcanic 
ash disruption, resulted in the cancellation of 9,490 Ryanair flights. The impact on Ryanair's profit before tax totaled 
EUR29.7 million consisting of EUR28.0 million in operating expenses (including passenger compensation of 
EUR12.4 million pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 ("EU261") and EUR1.7 million of other income/expense 
attributable to the period of flight disruption. The following table sets forth the components of Icelandic volcanic ash 
related costs associated with each category of operating expense:

 Holdings' Ordinary Shares by Non-EU nationals and the Company has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of 
Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals" above.
 The CAR is also responsible for deciding whether a regulated airport should be coordinated or fully coordinated 
under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 95/93 (as amended by Regulation (EC) No. 793/2004) on slots and for 
authorizing ground handling operations under Council Directive 96/67/EC and its implementing legislation. In April 
2005, the CAR announced that Dublin Airport would be fully slot-coordinated beginning in March 2006. Ryanair 
successfully challenged this decision in the Irish High Court, and the decision was overturned in July 2006. In 
February 2007, the CAR re-imposed full coordination at Dublin Airport. Ryanair again challenged this decision in the 
Irish High Court, but subsequently withdrew the challenge. See "-Slots" below for additional information regarding 
this litigation.
 Ryanair's current operating license became effective on December 1, 1993, and is subject to periodic review. The 
Flight Operations Department is also subject to ongoing review by the Irish Aviation Authority (the IAA), which 
reviews the department's audits, including flight audits, training audits, document audits, and quality audits. 
Ryanair's current Air Operator Certificate No IE 7/94 was issued on January 26, 2011.
 Irish Aviation Authority. The IAA is primarily responsible for the operational and regulatory function and services 
relating to the safety and technical aspects of aviation in Ireland. To operate in Ireland and the EU, an Irish air 
carrier is required to hold an operator's certificate granted by the IAA attesting to the air carrier's operational and 
technical competence to conduct airline services with specified types of aircraft. The IAA has broad authority to 
amend or revoke an operator's certificate, with Ryanair's ability to continue to hold its operator's certificate being 
subject to ongoing compliance with applicable statutes, rules and regulations pertaining to the airline industry, 
including any new rules and regulations that may be adopted in the future.
 The IAA is also responsible for overseeing and regulating the operations of Irish air carriers. Matters within the 
scope of the IAA's regulatory authority include: air safety; aircraft certification; personnel licensing and training; 
maintenance, manufacture, repair, airworthiness, and operation of aircraft; implementation of EU legislation; aircraft 
noise; and ground services. Each of the Company's aircraft is required to have a Certificate of Airworthiness, which 
is issued by the IAA. The validity of Certificates of Airworthiness is subject to the review of a committee of the IAA. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -31-
Each certificate is generally valid for a 12-month period. In March 2009, Ryanair received "Sub-Part (I) approval" 
from the IAA, which gives Ryanair the authority to extend the validity of its certificates, subject to certain record 
checks and physical aircraft inspections being performed by Ryanair's quality department. The Company's flight 
personnel, flight and emergency procedures, aircraft, and maintenance facilities are subject to periodic inspections 
and tests by the IAA. The IAA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the authority to require 
reports; inspect the books, records, premises, and aircraft of a carrier; and investigate and institute enforcement 
proceedings. Failure to comply with IAA regulations can result in revocation of operating certification.
 In July 1999,the IAA awarded Ryanair an air operator's certificate, which is subject to routine audit and review, in 
recognition of Ryanair's satisfaction of the relevant EU requirements for the operation of commercial air transport 
("EU OPS 1"). The requirements of EU OPS 1 have been incorporated into European law as prescribed in 
Regulation (EEC) 3922/91 and were applied in full on July 16, 2008. All current regulatory requirements are 
addressed in the Ryanair Operations Manual Part A (as amended). The current Manual, Issue 3 Revision 7, was 
approved by the IAA on April 1, 2011.
 Department of Transport. The Department of Transport ("DOT") is responsible for implementation of certain EU 
and Irish legislation and international standards relating to air transport (e.g., noise levels, aviation security, etc.).
 In June 2005, the Irish Minister for Transport enacted legislation strengthening rights for air passengers following 
the enactment of EU legislation requiring compensation of airline passengers who have been denied boarding on a 
flight for which they hold a valid ticket (Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004), which came into force on February 17, 2005. 
See "Item 3. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Airline Industry-EU Regulation on Passenger Compensation Could 
Significantly Increase Related Costs."
 The European Aviation Safety Agency. EASA is an agency of the EU that has been given specific regulatory and 
executive tasks in the field of aviation safety. EASA was established through Regulation (EC) No. 1592/2002 of the 
European Parliament and the Council of July 15, 2002. The purpose of EASA is to draw-up common standards to 
ensure the highest levels of safety, oversee their uniform application across Europe and promote them at the global 
level. The EASA formally started its work on September 28, 2003, taking over the responsibility for regulating 
airworthiness and maintenance issues within the EU member states.
 Eurocontrol. The European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation ("Eurocontrol") is an autonomous 
European organization established under the Eurocontrol Convention of December 13, 1960. Eurocontrol is 
responsible for, inter alia, the safety of air navigation and the collection of route charges for en route air navigation 
facilities and services throughout Europe. Ireland is a party to several international agreements concerning 
Eurocontrol. These agreements have been implemented in Irish law, which provides for the payment of charges to 
Eurocontrol in respect of air navigation services for aircraft in airspace under the control of Eurocontrol. The 
relevant legislation imposes liability for the payment of any charges upon the operators of the aircraft in respect of 
which services are provided and upon the owners of such aircraft or the managers of airports used by such aircraft. 
Ryanair, as an aircraft operator, is primarily responsible for the payment to Eurocontrol of charges incurred in 
relation to its aircraft.
 The legislation authorizes the detention of aircraft in the case of default in the payment of any charge for air 
navigation services by the aircraft operator or the aircraft owner, as the case may be. This power of detention 
extends to any equipment, stores or documents, which may be onboard the aircraft when it is detained, and may 
result in the possible sale of the aircraft.
 European Commission. The European Commission is in the process of introducing a "single European sky policy," 
which would lead to changes to air traffic management and control within the EU. The "single European sky policy" 
currently consists of the Framework Regulation (Reg. (EC) No. 549/2004) plus three technical regulations on the 
provision of air navigation services, organization and use of the airspace and the interoperability of the European air 
traffic management network. These regulations have recently been amended by the so-called "Single European 
Sky II" regulation (EU Regulation 1070/09). The objective of the policy is to enhance safety standards and the 
overall efficiency of air traffic in Europe, as well as to reduce the cost of air traffic control services.
 On September 6, 2005, the European Commission announced new guidelines on the financing of airports and 
start-up aid to airlines by regional airports based on its February 2004 finding in the Charleroi case, a decision that 
the CFI has since annulled in December 2008. The guidelines only apply to publicly owned regional airports, and 
place restrictions on the incentives that these airports can offer airlines to deliver traffic. Ryanair believes that the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -31-
CFI's annulment of the Charleroi decision severely undermines these guidelines. In April 2011, the European 
Commission launched a consultation on the revision of the 2005 guidelines. However, no assurance can be given 
that the revised guidelines will better reflect the commercial reality of the liberalized air transport market and 
consequently allow public airports to offer similar incentives to those offered by private airports.
 The European Union also adopted legislation on airport charges (EU Directive 2009/12), which was originally 
intended to address abusive pricing at monopoly airports. However, the legislation includes all European airports 
with over five million passengers per year. Management believes that this will likely increase the administrative 
burdens on smaller airports and may lead to higher airport charges, while the scope that exists within this Directive 
to address abuses of their dominant positions by Europe's larger airports is very limited. See "Item 7. Major 
Shareholders and Related-Party Transactions [3/4]Other Financial Information[3/4]Legal Proceedings[3/4]EU State 
Aid-Related Proceedings."
 The European Union also passed legislation calling for increased transparency in airline fares, which requires the 
inclusion of all mandatory taxes, fees, and charges in advertised prices. Ryanair currently includes this information 
in its advertised fares in all markets where it operates. However, certain regulatory authorities have alleged that 
some fees applied by airlines, including Ryanair, on an avoidable basis are in fact mandatory. Ryanair amended its 
website to include information on fees in June 2012 and plans to incorporate further changes to meet these 
requirements on its website in August 2012 and December 2012.

Body
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to makejudgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses.  These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of 
which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. These 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period 
of the revision and future periods if these are also affected. Principal sources of estimation uncertainty 
have been set out in the critical accounting policy section in Note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements. Such uncertainties may impact the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries at future 
dates.
 Statement of compliance
 The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, which 
are effective at March 31, 2012 as applied in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012.
 The directors have reviewed all EU endorsed IFRSs as set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements, and have concluded their adoption will not have a significant impact on the parent entity 
financial statements.
 Share-based payments
 The Company accounts for the fair value of share options granted to employees of a subsidiary as an 
increase in its investment in that subsidiary. The fair value of such options is determined in a 
consistent manner to that set out in the Group share-based payment accounting policy and as set out in 
Note 15 (c) to the consolidated financial statements.
 Income taxes
 Income taxes are accounted for by the Company in a manner consistent to that set out in the Group income 
tax accounting policy.
 Financial assets
 The Company holds investments in subsidiary companies, which are carried at cost less any impairments.
 Guarantees
 The Company occasionally guarantees certain liabilities of subsidiary companies. These are considered to 
be insurance arrangements and are accounted for as such i.e. a contingent liability until such time as it 
becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -94-
 Loans and borrowings
 All loans and borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of consideration received, net of 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-current interest bearing loans are 
measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest yield methodology.

At March 31, 2012, Ryanair Holdings plc had borrowings of EUR35.2 million (2011: EUR35.2 million; 2010: 
EUR35.2 million) from Ryanair Limited. The loan is interest free and repayable on demand.
 33    Financial instruments
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -94-
 The Company does not undertake hedging activities on behalf of itself or other companies within the 
Group. Financial instruments in the Company primarily take the form of loans to subsidiary undertakings.
 Amounts due to or from subsidiary undertakings (primarily Ryanair Limited) in the form of inter-company 
loans are interest free and are repayable upon demand and further details of these have been given in 
Notes 31 and 32 of the parent entity financial statements. These inter-company balances are eliminated in 
the group consolidation.
 The euro is the functional and presentation currency of the Company's balance sheet and all transactions 
entered into by the Company are euro denominated. As such, the Company does not have any significant 
foreign currency risk.
 The credit risk associated with the Company's financial assets principally relates to the credit risk of 
the Ryanair group as a whole, which is not rated by an external rating agency. Additionally the Company 
had guaranteed certain of its subsidiary company liabilities. Details of these arrangements are given in 
Note 34 to the company financial statements.
 34    Contingencies
 a)   The Company has provided EUR5,503.4 million (2011: EUR5,349.6 million; 2010: EUR4,384.2 million) in 
letters of guarantee to secure obligations of subsidiary undertakings in respect of loans, bank advances 
and long dated foreign currency transactions.
 b)     In order to avail itself of the exemption contained in Section 17 of the Companies (Amendment) 
Act, 1986, the holding company, Ryanair Holdings plc, has guaranteed the liabilities of its subsidiary 
undertakings registered in Ireland. As a result, the subsidiary undertakings have been exempted from the 
provisions of Section 7 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986. Details of the Group's principal 
subsidiaries have been included at Note 27. The Irish subsidiaries of the Group covered by the Section 17 
exemption are listed at Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements also. Four additional Irish 
subsidiaries covered by this exemption, which are not listed as principal subsidiaries at Note 27 to the 
consolidated financial statements, are Airport Marketing Services Limited, FRC Investments Limited, 
Coinside Limited and Mazine Limited.
 35    Dividends
 In June 2012, Ryanair Limited proposed a second special dividend of EUR0.34 per share (approximately 
EUR483m) payable in November 2012 subject to shareholder approval.
 Prior to effecting the dividend payment and in order to ensure that Ryanair Holdings plc, had sufficient 
distributable profits to effect the dividend payment, Ryanair Limited declared a dividend of EUR950 
million to Ryanair Holdings plc. during the fiscal year to March 31, 2012.
 36   Post-balance sheet events
 On March 29, 2012, the Company agreed to buy back 15.0m ordinary shares at a cost of EUR67.5m. This is 
equivalent to 1.0% of the issued share capital of the Company at March 31, 2012. This trade settled in 
early April 2012 and the shares were cancelled.
 37   Date of approval
 The Company financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

 While these hedging strategies can cushion the impact on Ryanair of fuel price increases in the short term, in the 
medium to longer-term, such strategies cannot be expected to eliminate the impact on the Company of an increase 
in the market price of jet fuel. The unrealized gains on outstanding forward agreements at March 31, 2012 and 
2011, based on their fair values, amounted to EUR145.8 million and EUR383.8 million (gross of tax), respectively. 
Based on Ryanair's fuel consumption for the 2012 fiscal year, a change of $1.00 in the average annual price per 
metric ton of jet fuel would have caused a change of approximately EUR1.7 million in Ryanair's fuel costs. See 
"Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability 
Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Losses."
 Under IFRS, the Company's fuel forward contracts are treated as cash-flow hedges of forecast fuel purchases for 
risks arising from the commodity price of fuel. The contracts are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are 
re-measured to fair value at the end of each fiscal period through equity to the extent effective, with any 
ineffectiveness recorded through the income statement. The Company has considered these hedges to be highly 
effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from fluctuations in the market price of jet fuel because 
the jet fuel forward contracts typically relate to the same quantity, time, and location of delivery as the forecast jet 
fuel purchase being hedged and the duration of the contracts is typically short. Accordingly, the quantification of the 
change in expected cash flows of the forecast jet fuel purchase is based on the jet fuel forward price, and in the 
2012 fiscal year, the Company recorded no hedge ineffectiveness within earnings. The Company has recorded no 
level of ineffectiveness on its jet fuel hedges in its income statements to date. In the 2012 fiscal year, the Company 
recorded a positive fair-value adjustment of EUR127.6 million (net of tax) within accumulated other comprehensive 
income in respect of jet fuel forward contracts, and in the 2011 fiscal year, the Company recorded a positive fair-
value adjustment of EUR335.8 million (net of tax) within accumulated other comprehensive income.
 FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE AND HEDGING
 In recent years, Ryanair's revenues have been denominated primarily in two currencies, the euro and U.K. pound 
sterling. The U.K. pound sterling and the euro accounted for approximately 24% and 65%, respectively, of Ryanair's 
total revenues in the 2012 fiscal year, as compared to approximately 24% and 67%, respectively, in the 2011 fiscal 
year. As Ryanair reports its results in euro, the Company is not exposed to any material currency risk as a result of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -57-
its euro-denominated activities. Ryanair's operating expenses are primarily denominated in euro, U.K. pounds 
sterling and U.S. dollars. Ryanair's operations can be subject to significant direct exchange rate risks between the 
euro and the U.S. dollar because a significant portion of its operating costs (particularly those related to fuel 
purchases) is incurred in U.S. dollars, while none of its revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. Appreciation of 
the euro against the U.S. dollar positively impacts Ryanair's operating income because the euro equivalent of its 
U.S. dollar operating costs decreases, while depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar negatively impacts 
operating income. It is Ryanair's policy to hedge a significant portion of its exposure to fluctuations in the exchange 
rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. From time to time, Ryanair hedges its operating surpluses and shortfalls 
in U.K. pound sterling. Ryanair matches certain U.K. pound sterling costs with U.K. pound sterling revenues and 
may choose to sell any surplus U.K. pound sterling cash flows for euro.
 Hedging associated with the income statement. In the 2012 and 2011 fiscal years, the Company entered into a 
series of forward contracts, principally euro/U.S. dollar forward contracts to hedge against variability in cash flows 
arising from market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates associated with its forecast fuel, maintenance and 
insurance costs and euro/U.K. pound sterling forward contracts to hedge certain surplus U.K. pound sterling cash 
flows. At March 31, 2012, the total unrealized gain relating to these contracts amounted to EUR89.4 million, 
compared to a EUR75.7 million unrealized loss at March 31, 2011.
 Under IFRS, these foreign currency forward contracts are treated as cash-flow hedges of forecast U.S. dollar and 
U.K. pound sterling purchases to address the risks arising from U.S. dollar and U.K. pound sterling exchange rates. 
The derivatives are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are re-measured to fair value at the end of each 
reporting period through equity to the extent effective, with ineffectiveness recorded through the income statement. 
Ryanair considers these hedges to be highly effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from 
fluctuations in exchange rates, because the forward contracts are timed so as to match exactly the amount, 
currency and maturity date of the forecast foreign currency-denominated expense being hedged. In the 2012 fiscal 
year, the Company recorded a positive fair-value adjustment of EUR86.1 million (net of tax) within accumulated 
other comprehensive income in respect of these contracts, as compared to a negative adjustment of EUR75.7 
million in the 2011 fiscal year.
 Hedging associated with the balance sheet. In the 2011 and 2012 fiscal years the Company entered into a series 
of cross currency interest rate swaps to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of US dollar-
denominated floating rate borrowings entered into during the 2011 and 2012 fiscal years, together with managing 
the exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on these US dollar-denominated floating rate borrowings. Cross 
currency interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert a portion of the Company's US dollar-denominated debt 
to euro and floating rate interest exposures into fixed rate exposures and are set so as to match exactly the critical 
terms of the underlying debt being hedged (i.e. notional principal, interest rate settings, re-pricing dates). These are 
all classified as cash-flow hedges of the forecasted US dollar variable interest payments on the Company's 
underlying debt and have been determined to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows. Accordingly, no 
ineffectiveness has been recorded in the income statement relating to these hedges in the 2011 and 2012 fiscal 
years.
 At March 31, 2012, the fair value of the cross currency interest rate swap agreements relating to this US dollar-
denominated floating rate debt was represented by a loss of EUR7.4 million (gross of tax) compared to a loss of 
EUR7.9 million in fiscal 2011. In the 2012 fiscal year, the Company recorded a negative fair-value adjustment of 
EUR6.5 million (net of tax), compared to a loss of EUR6.9 million in fiscal 2011, within accumulated other 
comprehensive income in respect of these contracts.
 Hedging associated with capital expenditures. During the 2012 and 2011 fiscal years, the Company also entered 
into a series of euro/U.S. dollar contracts to hedge against changes in the fair value of aircraft purchase 
commitments under the Boeing contracts, which arise from fluctuations in the U.K. pound sterling/U.S. dollar and 
euro/U.S. dollar exchange rates.
 Under IFRS, the Company generally accounts for these contracts as either cash-flow hedges or fair-value hedges. 
Fair-value hedges are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Any gains or losses arising on these instruments, 
as well as the related gain or loss on the underlying aircraft purchase commitment, are recorded in the balance 
sheet. Any related ineffectiveness is measured by the amount by which these adjustments to earnings do not 
match. Cash-flow hedges are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are re-measured to fair value at the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -57-
end of the financial period through equity to the extent effective, with any ineffectiveness recorded through the 
income statement. The Company expects these hedges to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value 
of the aircraft purchase commitments arising from fluctuations in exchange rates because the forward exchange 
contracts are always for the same amount, currency and maturity dates as the corresponding aircraft purchase 
commitments.
 At March 31, 2012, the total unrealized gains relating to these contracts amounted to EUR6.8 million, while at 
March 31, 2011 unrealized gains amounted to EUR3.7 million. Under IFRS, the Company recorded positive fair-
value adjustments of EUR6.0 million and positive fair-value adjustments of EUR3.2 million for cash-flow hedges in 
the 2012 and 2011 fiscal years, respectively. No amounts were recorded for such fair-value hedges from other 
accumulated comprehensive income in the 2012 and 2011 fiscal years.
 Holding other variables constant, if there were an adverse change of 10% in relevant foreign currency exchange 
rates, the market value of Ryanair's foreign currency contracts outstanding at March 31, 2012 would decrease by 
approximately EUR176.3 million (net of tax), all of which would ultimately impact earnings when such contracts 
mature.

 In May 2012, Ryanair further upgraded its reservation system in order to facilitate the continued expansion of the 
airline.  The upgraded system gives the Company the ability to offer more enhancements to passengers, as the 
new platform is far more flexible in terms of future development. Under the agreement with the system-provider, 
Navitaire, the system serves as Ryanair's core seating inventory and booking system. In return for access to these 
system functions, Ryanair pays transaction fees that are generally based on the number of passenger seat journeys 
booked through the system. Navitaire also retains a back-up booking engine to support operations in the event of a 
breakdown in the main system. Over the last several years, Ryanair has introduced a number of Internet-based 
customer service enhancements such as Internet check-in, priority boarding service and limited reserved seating in 
January 2012.  Since October 2009, Ryanair has required Internet check-in for all passengers. These 
enhancements and changes have been made to reduce waiting time at airports and speed a passenger's journey 
from arrival at the airport to boarding, as well as significantly reduce airport handling costs. Ryanair has also 
introduced a checked-bag fee, which is payable on the Internet and is aimed at reducing the number of bags carried 
by passengers in order to further reduce handling costs. See Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Company-Ryanair Faces Risks Related to Unauthorized Use of Information from the Company's Website."
 AIRCRAFT
 Aircraft
 As of June 30, 2012, Ryanair's operating fleet was composed of 294 Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, 
each having 189 seats. Ryanair's fleet totaled 294 Boeing 737-800s at March 31, 2012. The Company expects to 
have an operating fleet comprising 305 Boeing 737-800s at March 31, 2013.
 Between March 1999 and March 2012, Ryanair took delivery of 333 new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft 
under its contracts with Boeing (and disposed of 39 such aircraft including 13 lease handbacks).
 Ryanair entered into a series of agreements with Boeing for Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft starting in 
1998. As of January 2005, 89 firm-order aircraft remained to be delivered under those agreements, and the 
Company had options to purchase an additional 123 aircraft. On February 24, 2005, the Company announced that 
it had entered into a new agreement with Boeing for the purchase of a further 70 new Boeing 737-800s as well as 
purchase options for an additional 70 such aircraft.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -26-
 Under the terms of the 2005 Boeing contract, while the basic price per aircraft that was applicable under the prior 
contracts continued to apply to the firm-order aircraft that remained to be delivered and purchase options 
outstanding thereunder, these firm-order and option aircraft became subject to the commercial and other terms 
applicable to the firm-order aircraft under the 2005 Boeing contract, including benefiting from more favorable price 
concessions.
 On December 18, 2009, the Company announced that it was unable to conclude negotiations with Boeing in 
respect of a new agreement for the purchase of 100 new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft (with an option to purchase 
an additional 100) for delivery during the period 2013 to 2015. Although the Company had reached agreement with 
Boeing in relation to the aircraft price and delivery dates it was unable to conclude negotiations regarding other 
terms and conditions. The Company has not entered into any agreement to purchase additional aircraft. However, 
on June 22, 2011, the Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding with COMAC, a Chinese aircraft 
manufacturer, to co-operate and work together in relation to the development of a 174-200 seat commercial aircraft.
 Ryanair expects to take delivery of a further 11 aircraft under its contracts with Boeing over the period from June 
30, 2012 to March 31, 2013. These deliveries will increase the size of Ryanair's fleet to 305 by March 2013 
(assuming that the planned disposal or return (under the terms of an operating lease) of four such aircraft is 
completed on schedule).  As of June 30, 2012, Ryanair had either sold to third parties or returned to the relevant 
lessor 43 Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Depending on market conditions and various other considerations, Ryanair 
expects to either dispose of four more aircraft or return such aircraft to the relevant lessor during the period through 
March 31, 2014.
 For additional details on the Boeing contracts, scheduled aircraft deliveries and related expenditures and their 
financing, as well as the terms of the arrangements under which Ryanair currently leases 55 of the aircraft in its 
operating fleet, see "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Liquidity and Capital Resources."
 Management believes that the purchase of the final 11 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft will allow Ryanair to continue 
to grow over the next two years. Management also believes that the significant size of its orders allowed Ryanair to 
obtain favorable purchase terms, guaranteed deliveries, and a standard configuration for all of the aircraft it 
purchased.
 The Boeing 737 is the world's most widely used commercial aircraft and exists in a number of generations, the 
Boeing 737-800s being the most recent. Management believes that spare parts and cockpit crews qualified to fly 
these aircraft are likely to be more widely available on favorable terms than similar resources for other types of 
aircraft. Management believes that its strategy, to date, of having reduced its fleet to one aircraft type enables 
Ryanair to limit the costs associated with personnel training, the purchase and storage of spare parts, and 
maintenance. Furthermore this strategy affords Ryanair greater flexibility in the scheduling of crews and equipment. 
The Boeing 737-800s are fitted with CFM 56-7B engines and have advanced CAT III Autoland capability, advanced 
traffic collision avoidance systems, and enhanced ground-proximity warning systems. On July 20, 2011, Boeing 
announced that it was seeking approval from its Board of Directors to manufacture a variant of the 737 with new, 
more fuel-efficient engines. This new variant could impact the Company insofar as the residual value of its aircraft 
could be reduced if this new variant is produced.
 At March 31, 2012, the average aircraft age of the Company's Boeing 737-800 fleet was just over 3.8 years.
 Training and Regulatory Compliance
 Ryanair currently owns and operates four Boeing 737-800 full flight simulators for pilot training, the first of which 
was delivered in 2002. The simulators were purchased from CAE Electronics Ltd. of Quebec, Canada ("CAE"). The 
second simulator was delivered in 2004, while the third and fourth simulators were delivered in the 2008 fiscal year. 
In September 2006, Ryanair entered into a new contract with CAE to purchase B737NG Level B flight simulators. 
Two of these simulators were delivered in the 2009 fiscal year. This contract also provides Ryanair with an option to 
purchase another five such simulators. The gross price of each simulator is approximately $8 million, not taking into 
account certain price concessions provided by the seller in the form of credit memoranda and discounts.
 Management believes that Ryanair is currently in compliance with all applicable regulations and EU directives 
concerning its fleet of Boeing 737-800 aircraft and will comply with any regulations or EU directives that may come 
into effect in the future. However, there can be no assurance that the FAA or other regulatory authorities will not 
recommend or require other safety-related undertakings that could adversely impact the Company's results of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -26-
operations or financial condition. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Safety-Related Undertakings Could 
Affect the Company's Results."
 ANCILLARY SERVICES
 Ryanair provides various ancillary services and engages in other activities connected with its core air passenger 
service, including non-flight scheduled services, Internet-related services, and the in-flight sale of beverages, food, 
and merchandise. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Results of Operations-Fiscal Year 
2012 Compared with Fiscal Year 2011-Ancillary Revenues" for additional information.
 As part of its non-flight scheduled and Internet-related services Ryanair incentivizes ground service providers at 
many of the airports it serves to levy correct excess baggage charges for any baggage that exceeds Ryanair's 
published baggage allowances and to collect these charges in accordance with Ryanair's standard terms and 
conditions. Excess baggage charges are recorded as non-flight scheduled revenue.
 Ryanair primarily distributes accommodation services and travel insurance through its website. For hotel services, 
Ryanair has a contract with Hotelscombined PTY Ltd. ("Hotelscombined"), which operates a price comparison 
website, pursuant to which Hotelscombined handles all aspects of such services marketed through Ryanair's 
website and pays a fee to Ryanair. Ryanair also has contracts with other accommodation providers that enable 
Ryanair to offer hostel, bed-and-breakfast, guesthouse, villa and apartment accommodation to its customers. In 
addition Ryanair has a contract with Hertz, pursuant to which Hertz handles all car rental services marketed through 
Ryanair's website or telephone reservation system.
 Ryanair also sells bus and rail tickets onboard its aircraft and through its website. Ryanair also sells attractions and 
activities on its website with the former going on sale in-flight in spring 2012.
 Ryanair sells gift vouchers on its website. Such gift vouchers are also redeemable online. In May 2009, Ryanair 
started to offer its passengers the possibility of receiving an SMS (text message) when booking, at a fee of 
GBP1.50 or EUR1.50, to inform them of their flight confirmation details.

 Ancillary revenues. Ryanair's ancillary revenues, which comprise revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, 
in-flight sales and Internet-related services, increased 10.6%, from EUR801.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year to 
EUR886.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year, while ancillary revenues per booked passenger increased to EUR11.69 
from EUR11.12. Revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, including revenues from excess baggage 
charges, debit and credit card transactions, sales of rail and bus tickets, accommodations, travel insurance and car 
rental increased 12.4% to EUR645.6 million from EUR574.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year. Revenues from in-flight 
sales increased 6.4%, to EUR107.2 million from EUR100.7 million in the 2011 fiscal year. Revenues from Internet-
related services, primarily commissions received from products sold on Ryanair.com or linked websites, increased 
5.3%, from EUR126.7 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR133.4 million in the 2012 fiscal year. The rate of 
increase in revenues from all ancillary revenue categories exceeded the increase in overall passengers booked.
 The following table sets forth the components of ancillary revenues earned by Ryanair and each component 
expressed as a percentage of total ancillary revenues for each of the periods indicated:

Operating expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, Ryanair's operating expenses decreased from 86.5% in 
the 2011 fiscal year to 84.5% in the 2012 fiscal year, as total revenues increased by 21.0%, faster than the 18.0% 
increase in operating expenses. In absolute terms, total operating expenses increased 18.0%, from EUR3,141.3 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -37-
million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR3,707.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, principally as a result of a 29.9% 
increase in fuel costs from EUR1,227.0 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR1,593.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year. 
Staff costs, depreciation and amortization, maintenance expenses, aircraft rental expenses, route charges, airport 
handling charges and marketing, distribution and other costs decreased as a percentage of total revenues, while 
fuel and oil increased. Total operating expenses per ASM increased by 5.1%, with the increase reflecting, 
principally, the increase in passenger capacity (as measured in ASMs) during the 2012 fiscal year and the impact of 
the higher fuel costs.
 The Company's decision to ground aircraft did not have a material impact on the results of the Company for the 
year ended March 31, 2012 and, at present, is not anticipated to have a material impact on future operations. The 
Company anticipates that any revenues which could have been generated had the Company operated the 
grounded aircraft would have been lower than the operating costs associated with operating these aircraft, due to 
significantly higher fuel costs, airport charges and taxes. The Company does not anticipate that any material staff 
costs will be incurred during future periods of the grounding of aircraft, as the relevant staff can be furloughed under 
the terms of their contracts without compensation and the maintenance costs associated with the grounded aircraft 
will be minimal. However, the Company will still incur aircraft ownership costs comprised of depreciation and 
amortization costs, lease rentals costs and financing costs.
 The following table sets forth the amounts in euro cent of, and percentage changes in, Ryanair's operating 
expenses (on a per-ASM basis) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011 under IFRS. These 
data are calculated by dividing the relevant expense amount (as shown in the consolidated financial statements) by 
the number of ASMs in the relevant year as shown in the table of "Selected Operating and Other Data" in Item 3 
and rounding to the nearest euro cent; the percentage change is calculated on the basis of the relevant figures 
before rounding.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -37-
 Total operating
 expenses...............................................................                5.21          4.96       
5.1%
 ============  ============  =========
Staff costs. Ryanair's staff costs, which consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits, decreased 1.7% on a per-
ASM basis, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 10.3%, from EUR376.1 million in the 2011 fiscal year 
(which included EUR4.6 million in relation to volcanic ash expenses) to EUR415.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year. 
The increase in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a 10.5% increase in hours flown and a Company-wide 
pay increase of 2% granted in April 2011, partially offset by a EUR2.5 million reversal of previously recognized 
share-based payment compensation expense for awards that did not vest.
 Depreciation and amortization.Ryanair's depreciation and amortization per ASM decreased by 0.8%, while in 
absolute terms these costs increased 11.3% from EUR277.7 million in the 2011 fiscal year, to EUR309.2 million in 
the 2012 fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of 14 owned aircraft (net of disposals) to 
the fleet during the 2012 fiscal year. See "-Critical Accounting Policies-Long-lived Assets" above.
 Fuel and oil. Ryanair's fuel and oil costs per ASM increased by 15.7%, while in absolute terms, these costs 
increased by 29.9% from EUR1,227.0 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR1,593.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year, in 
each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities. The 29.9% increase reflected an 18.2% 
increase in average fuel prices paid, the impact of a 10.5% increase in the number of hours flown and a 6.1% 
increase in the average sector length. Fuel and oil costs include the direct cost of fuel, the cost of delivering fuel to 
the aircraft, and aircraft de-icing costs. The average fuel price paid by Ryanair (calculated by dividing total fuel costs 
by the number of U.S. gallons of fuel consumed) increased 18.2% from EUR1.76 per U.S. gallon in the 2011 fiscal 
year to EUR2.08 per U.S. gallon in the 2012 fiscal year, in each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel 
hedging activities.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs. Ryanair's maintenance, materials and repair expenses, which consist primarily 
of the cost of routine maintenance and the overhaul of spare parts, decreased 1.3% on a per-ASM basis, while in 
absolute terms these expenses increased by 10.8% from EUR93.9 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR104.0 
million in the 2012 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms during the fiscal year reflected the additional costs 
arising from increased level of activity and the opening of new bases.

 Tax Audits. The Company operates in many jurisdictions and is, from time to time, subject to tax audits, which by 
their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude. While the Company endeavors to be tax 
compliant in the various jurisdictions in which it operates, there can be no guarantee, particularly in the current 
economic environment, that it will not receive tax assessments following the conclusion of the tax audits.  If 
assessed, the Company will robustly defend its position.  In the event that the Company is unsuccessful in 
defending its position, it is possible that the effective tax rate, employment and other costs of the Group could 
materially increase.
 Risks Related to the Airline Industry
 The Airline Industry Is Particularly Sensitive to Changes in Economic Conditions; A Continued Recessionary 
Environment Would Negatively Impact Ryanair's Result of Operations. Ryanair's operations and the airline industry 
in general are sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions such as government 
austerity measures, the breakup of the eurozone, high unemployment rates, constrained credit markets and 
increased business operating costs lead to reduced spending by both leisure and business passengers. 
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as the conditions persisting as of the date hereof, also tend to impact 
Ryanair's ability to raise fares to counteract increased fuel and other operating costs. A continued recessionary 
environment, combined with austerity measures by European governments, will likely negatively impact Ryanair's 
operating results. It could also restrict the Company's ability to grow passenger volumes, secure new airports and 
launch new routes and bases, and could have a material adverse impact on its financial results.
 The Introduction of Government Taxes on Travel Could Damage Ryanair's Ability to Grow and Could Have a 
Material Adverse Impact on Operations. The U.K. government levies an Air Passenger Duty (APD) of GBP13 per 
passenger. The tax was previously set at GBP5 per passenger, but it was increased to GBP10 per passenger in 
2007, GBP11 in 2009, GBP12 in 2010 and subsequently to GBP13 in April 2012.  The increase in this tax is thought 
to have had a negative impact on Ryanair's operating performance, both in terms of average fares paid and growth 
in passenger volumes. In 2008, the Dutch government introduced a travel tax ranging from EUR11 on short-haul 
flights to EUR45 on long-haul flights (withdrawn with effect from July 1, 2009). On March 30, 2009, the Irish 
government also introduced a EUR10 Air Travel Tax on all passengers departing from Irish airports on routes 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -20-
longer than 300 kilometers but subsequently reduced it to EUR3 on March 30, 2011. In Germany, the government 
introduced an air passenger tax of EUR8.00 in January 2011 which was subsequently reduced to EUR7.50 in 
January 2012. In Austria, the government also introduced an ecological air travel levy of EUR8.00 in January 2011.
 Other governments also have introduced or may introduce similar taxes. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Airport Operations-Airport Charges." The introduction of government taxes on travel has had a negative impact on 
passenger volumes, particularly given the current period of decreased economic activity. The introduction of further 
government taxes on travel across Europe, could have a material negative impact on Ryanair's results of 
operations as a result of price-sensitive passengers being less likely to travel.
 EU Regulation on Passenger Compensation Could Significantly Increase Related Costs. The EU has passed 
legislation for compensating airline passengers who have been denied boarding on a flight for which they hold a 
valid ticket (Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004). This legislation, which came into force on February 17, 2005, imposes 
fixed levels of compensation to be paid to passengers in the event of cancelled flights. In November 2009, the Court 
of Justice of the EU in the Sturgeon case decided that provisions of the legislation in relation to compensation are 
not only applicable to flight cancellations but also to delays of over three hours. However, such provisions, by their 
terms, do not apply to any cancellation, or any delay over three hours, in circumstances in which the airline is able 
to prove that such cancellation or delay was caused by extraordinary circumstances, such as weather, air-traffic 
control delays, or safety issues. The Sturgeon case was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a 
preliminary ruling from the High Court of Justice (England & Wales), Queen's Bench Division (Administrative Court) 
on December 24, 2010.  The Opinion of the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice has reinforced the 
legitimacy of the Sturgeon judgment.  The Opinion is not binding on courts unless reconfirmed in the judgment 
which will be issued at the end of 2012. The regulation calls for compensation of EUR250, EUR400, or EUR600 per 
passenger, depending on the length of the flight. As Ryanair's average flight length is less than 1,500 km - the 
upper limit for short-haul flights - the amount payable is generally EUR250 per passenger per occurrence. 
Passengers subject to long delays (in excess of two hours for short-haul flights) are also entitled to "assistance," 
including meals, drinks and telephone calls, as well as hotel accommodations if the delay extends overnight. For 
delays of over five hours, the airline is also required to offer the option of a refund of the cost of the unused ticket. 
There can be no assurance that the Company will not incur a significant increase in costs in the future due to the 
impact of this legislation, if Ryanair experiences a large number of cancelled flights, which could occur as a result of 
certain types of events beyond its control. See "-Risks Related to the Airline Industry-Volcanic Ash Emissions Could 
Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's Results of Operations."
 EU Regulation of Emissions Trading Will Increase Costs. On November 19, 2008, the European Council of 
Ministers adopted legislation to add aviation to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme ("ETS") with effect from 2012. 
This scheme, which has thus far applied mainly to industrial companies, is a cap-and-trade system for CO(2) 
emissions to encourage industries to improve their CO(2) efficiency. Under the legislation, airlines are granted initial 
CO(2) allowances based on historical performance and a CO(2) efficiency benchmark. Any shortage of allowances 
will have to be purchased in the open market and/or at government auctions.  The cost of such allowances that 
Ryanair will have to buy in order to cover the shortage that will arise in calendar year 2012 are estimated to be in 
the region of EUR10 million to EUR15 million at current market rates. The Company estimates that the related cost 
in respect of calendar year 2013 could be in the region of EUR15 million to EUR25 million but could increase 
significantly over the coming years depending on the costs of carbon credits and the Company's future decisions on 
growth.  There can be no assurance that Ryanair will be able to obtain sufficient carbon credits or that the cost of 
the credits will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, and financial 
condition.
 Volcanic Ash Emissions Could Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's Results 
of Operations. Between April 15 and April 20, 2010 and May 4 and May 17, 2010, a significant portion of the 
airspace over northern Europe was closed by authorities as a result of safety concerns presented by emissions of 
ash from an Icelandic volcano. This closure forced Ryanair to cancel 9,490 flights. In May 2011, there were further 
periodic closures of parts of the European airspace due to emissions of ash from another Icelandic volcano, which 
resulted in the cancellation of 96 flights.
 Under the terms of Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004, described above, Ryanair has certain duties to passengers 
whose flights are cancelled. In particular, Ryanair is required to reimburse passengers who have had their flights 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -20-
cancelled for certain reasonable, documented expenses - primarily for accommodation and food. As of the date 
hereof, the Company is uncertain as to the number of claims it will receive or the amount it will have to reimburse 
passengers in respect of these claims, (as there is currently no time limitation on claims specified in the Regulation) 
but the Company expects that the amount will not be significant. The Company to date estimates that the non-
recoverable fixed costs associated with the cancellations, the repositioning costs for aircraft, and other costs 
associated with cancellations, as well as the aforementioned reimbursement claims for the initial 20 days of closure 
of European aerospace will amount to approximately EUR29 million for such periods of closure. The Company has 
re-accommodated or refunded fares to approximately 1.5 million passengers due to flight cancellations.
 Volcanic emissions may happen again and could lead to further significant flight cancellation costs which could 
have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, 
volcanic emissions (whether from current or new sources) or similar atmospheric disturbances and resulting 
cancellations due to the closure of airports could also have a material adverse affect on the Company's financial 
performance indirectly, as a consequence of changes in the public's willingness to travel within Europe due to the 
risk of flight disruptions.

 Operating costs rose 19% to EUR3,707 million, due to a EUR367 million (30%) increase in our fuel bill to 
EUR1,594 million and further unjustified price increases at Dublin Airport, where the Government owned DAA 
monopoly continues to raise airport fees while presiding over record traffic declines.  Over the past 4 
years, despite wasting EUR1.2 billion on its new Terminal 2, Dublin Airport's traffic has declined from 
23.5 million in 2008, to 18.7 million in 2011.  Ryanair has made a number of growth offers to Government 
to reverse these declines, and create thousands of new jobs at Dublin Airport, but so far these offers 
have not been taken up.
 In the UK, the Ferrovial owned BAA airport monopoly continues to launch Court appeals to delay the 
inevitable sale of Stansted Airport.  Ryanair is working with the Competition Commission to expedite the  
long delayed sale of Stansted which will, we believe, bring about much needed competition, lower costs and 
better passenger service at Stansted, and reverse 5 years of traffic declines from 24 million in 2007 to 
just 18 million in 2011 under the BAA's mismanagement.  We hope now that the BAA's latest appeal, which 
was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in mid July, will finally result in the sale of Stansted before the 
end of 2012.  Ryanair has held discussions with a number of parties who are interested in bidding for 
Stansted and we have assured them that subject to a competitive cost base, Ryanair would be willing to 
deliver rapid traffic growth at Stansted over a 5 year period.
 Ryanair welcomes the EU's recent ruling that the differential Irish air travel tax in 2009 was unlawful, 
and we hope this will encourage the Irish Government to repeal what remains of this damaging and anti-
visitor tax. Ryanair regrets the Spanish Government's recent decision to increase departure taxes at many 
Spanish airports (doubling them at Madrid and Barcelona) from 1(st) July.  Ryanair, and many other 
airlines at these airports have announced cuts to flights, traffic and jobs from October 2012, although we 
hope that the Spanish Government will change its mind and follow the earlier lead of the Dutch and Belgian 
Governments who reversed similar damaging passenger taxes.
 Our passengers
 Ryanair delivers Europe's No. 1 passenger service for the benefit of our passengers, our people and our 
shareholders.  We continue to grow delivering lower fares, better punctuality, fewer lost bags and, as a 
result have fewer passenger complaints than any other airline in Europe.
 Despite the current EU recession, and the spread of austerity measures, Ryanair's lowest fares continue 
to encourage passengers to travel, and more importantly fly with Ryanair.  Ryanair beats every other 
airline on price on every flight,  every route, every day.  We have grown to carry over 75.8 million 
passengers in the past year and IATA's 2011 traffic statistics confirm that Ryanair carriers far more 
international passengers than any other scheduled airline, making Ryanair the "world's" favourite airline.  
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -2-
Over the past year, Ryanair welcomed 75.8 million passengers onboard, at an average fare of just EUR45.  
These passengers saved an average of EUR7.6 billion over the high fares charged by our competitor's incl. 
Air France, British Airways, Easyjet and Lufthansa.
 Ryanair's growth and profitability is not based solely on price.  In addition to the lowest fares in 
every market last year, Ryanair also delivered:
 1.     The best punctuality - 91% of flights on-time (up 6%).
 2.     The fewest lost bags - We lost less than 1 bag for every 4,000 passengers carried, an improvement 
on the prior year.
 3.     The fewest complaints - Last year we received less than 1 complaint per 2,000 passengers, an 
improvement on the prior year.
 4.     The youngest fleet - the average age of our 294 aircraft is under 4 years old.
 5.     Rapid passenger complaint responses - Over 99% replied to within 7 days.
 6.     The world's greenest, cleanest airline - Independent research confirms Ryanair is the world's 
greenest/cleanest airline, which allows all passengers to demonstrate their commitment to the environment 
by switching their travel choice to Ryanair.

 Our people
 Over the past year average headcount in Ryanair rose to 8,438.  Within this number, more than 568 people 
were promoted, as our growth created new opportunities for career progression and development.  Our people 
know that they can advance their careers by taking advantage of Ryanair's commitment to promote from 
within wherever possible.  At a time when many European airlines are cutting jobs, or closing (as in the 
case of Spanair, Malev, Cimber Sterling, and OLT Express in recent months) Ryanair is proud of its long-
standing record of job creation and internal promotions.
 Our shareholders
 Unlike other airlines, Ryanair continues to deliver significant returns for shareholders.  In Ryanair the 
Board and Management team hold a significant stake in the company, which means we think and act like 
shareholders, precisely because we are substantial shareholders.
 Our 2012 net profit of EUR503 million ($672 million) makes Ryanair one of the world's most profitable 
airlines. Ryanair's increased profits and the substantial cash reserves means that our Board is able to 
recommend a second special dividend of EUR0.34 (approx. EUR489 million) to shareholders in late 2012, 
subject to AGM approval in September.  The airline has completed three further share buybacks in the last 
year amounting to EUR193 million. As a result of these two special dividends and share buybacks, Ryanair 
has returned more than EUR1.53 billion to shareholders over the past five years.
 It is remarkable that having raised just EUR559 million from our flotation and four secondary offers in 
1998, 2000, 2001 and 2002 Ryanair has now returned almost 3 times this amount (over EUR1.53 billion) to 
shareholders in recent years.
 Ryanair continues to look for opportunities to invest our cash wisely.  While we have no requirement for 
new aircraft orders in the immediate future, we would hope to expand the fleet with deliveries from 
2015/16 onwards.   Our discussions with manufacturers continue, but we will only order aircraft when we 
believe that the pricing will make it profitable for our shareholders to do so.
 Finally, I would like to sincerely thank our Chairman, my fellow Board members, our Managers and all the 
team at Ryanair for their hard work over the past 12 months, which has helped us deliver another year of 
low fare traffic growth and record profits for the benefit of our passengers, our people and our 
shareholders.
 Yours sincerely
 Michael O'Leary
 Chief Executive

CHAIRMAN'S REPORT
 Dear Shareholders,
 I am very pleased to report a 25% increase in profit after tax to a new record of EUR503 million.  This 
was a strong performance despite a EUR367 million rise in fuel costs which we managed to offset by a 16% 
rise in average fares.
 During the year Ryanair delivered a number of significant milestones:
 --   We grew our traffic by 5% to 76 million passengers.
 --   We took delivery of 25 (net) new aircraft and we had a year-end fleet of 294 Boeing 737-800's.
 --   We opened 6 new bases and 330 new routes bringing the total number of routes operated to over 1,500.
 --   We improved our industry leading passenger service with better punctuality, fewer lost bags and less 
cancellations.
 --      We completed a share buyback of EUR125 million in fiscal 2012 and EUR68 million in April 2012, 
and the board have proposed a dividend of EUR0.34 per share amounting to approximately EUR489 million 
subject to shareholder approval at the annual general meeting.  The combination of the second special 
dividend (subject to shareholder approval) and previous share buybacks and dividends will mean that 
Ryanair has returned an industry leading EUR1.53 billion to shareholders over the past 5 years.
 Fuel costs as a proportion of our total operating costs have risen to 43% in fiscal 2012.  We are 90% 
hedged for fiscal 2013, at just over $100 per barrel and we are faced with a further EUR320 million 
increase in our fuel bill, a total increase in 2 years of EUR687 million.  Oil price rises and higher 
winter airport charges at certain government owned airports will make it commercially sound to ground up 
to 80 aircraft rather than suffer losses operating these aircraft during the winter when yields are 
significantly lower.  Nevertheless, we still expect passenger volumes in fiscal 2013 to grow by 
approximately 5% to 79 million passengers.
 In the airline industry, we yet again face another challenging year with significantly higher fuel prices 
and with European government fiscal deficits resulting in austerity measures and leading to falling 
European consumer confidence. As recessionary pressures continue we believe more carriers will exit the 
industry and we intend to take advantage of those developments, as we have this year, when we opened a new 
base in Budapest following the closure of Malev, and significantly expanded our operations at Barcelona 
and Madrid following the closure of Spanair. We believe that the winners will be those airlines with 
strong balance sheets (we currently have over EUR3.8 billion in cash), the lowest costs and a strong 
sustainable business model.
 I would like to take this opportunity to thank Paolo Pietrogrande for his contribution and commitment to 
Ryanair as a director over the last eleven years.  Although eligible,  Paolo has decided not to stand for 
re-election at the AGM on September 21, 2012 and we wish him much success in the future.
 Notwithstanding the issues we face, the outstanding people at Ryanair continue to work hard on behalf of 
shareholders to reduce our costs while at the same time delivering the lowest fares in Europe to our 79 
million passengers.  As a result, we still expect to generate significant profits in fiscal 2013 although 
these are likely to be lower than we enjoyed in fiscal 2012.
 Yours sincerely,
 _______________
 David Bonderman
 Chairman
 CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REPORT
 Dear Shareholders,
 Our results for the past year underline the enduring strength of Ryanair's ultra low fare airline model 
here in Europe.  While traffic growth has slowed, Ryanair delivered a 25% increase in annual profits to a 
new record of EUR503 million.  Our traffic grew 5% to 75.8 million, our load factor was 82% and average 
fare (which include optional checked in bag fees) rose by 16% to EUR45.  Group turnover rose 19% to 
EUR4,325 million, which included scheduled revenue growth of 22% to EUR3,439 million, and ancillary 
revenue growth of 11% to EUR886 million.

Body
 Mr. David Bonderman has served as the chairman of the Board since December 1996. The Chairman's primary 
responsibility is to lead the Board, to ensure that it has a common purpose, is effective as a group and at individual 
director level and that it upholds and promotes high standards of integrity and corporate governance. He ensures 
that Board agendas cover the key strategic issues confronting the Group; that the Board reviews and approves 
management's plans for the Group; and that directors receive accurate, timely, clear and relevant information.
 The Chairman is the link between the Board and the Company. He is specifically responsible for establishing and 
maintaining an effective working relationship with the Chief Executive, for ensuring effective and appropriate 
communications with shareholders and for ensuring that members of the Board develop and maintain an 
understanding of the views of shareholders.
 While Mr. David Bonderman holds a number of other directorships (See details on page 96), the Board considers 
that these do not interfere with the discharge of his duties to Ryanair.
 Senior Independent Director
 The Board has appointed Mr. James Osborne as the Senior Independent Director. Mr. James Osborne is available 
to shareholders who have concerns that cannot be addressed through the Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief 
Financial Officer and leads the annual Board review of the performance of the Chairman.
 Company Secretary
 The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board. All directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures 
are complied with.
 Membership
 The Board consists of one executive and eight non-executive directors. It is the practice of Ryanair that a majority 
of the Board comprises non-executive Directors, considered by the Board to be independent, and that the Chairman 
is non-executive.  The Board considers the current size and composition of the Board to be within a range which is 
appropriate.  Significant new and relevant experience has been added in the period since the year ended March 31, 
2011.  The composition of the Board and the principal Board Committees are set out in the table below. Brief 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -5-
biographies of the directors are set out on page 96. The Board, with the assistance of the Nomination Committee, 
keeps Board composition under review to ensure that it includes the necessary mix of relevant skills and experience 
required to perform its role.
 Each director has extensive business experience, which they bring to bear in governing the Company. The Board 
considers that, between them, the directors bring the range of skills, knowledge and experience, including 
international experience, necessary to lead the Company. The Company has a Chairman with an extensive 
background in this industry, and significant public company experience. Historically, the Company has always 
separated the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive for the running of the business and implementation of the 
Board's strategy and policy.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -5-
*   Kyran McLaughlin retired from the Audit Committee from December 2011.
 ** Charles McCreevy was appointed to the Audit Committee effective January 2012.
 ***Declan McKeon was appointed as Chairman of the Audit Committee effective December 2011.
 Appointment
 Directors can only be appointed following selection by the Nomination Committee and approval by the Board 
and must be elected by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment. 
Ryanair's Articles of Association require that all of the directors retire and offer themselves for re-
election within a three-year period. One third (rounded down to the next whole number if it is a 
fractional number) of the directors (being the directors who have been longest in office) will retire by 
rotation and be eligible for re-election at every Annual General Meeting. Accordingly Mr. Michael Horgan 
and Mr. Kyran McLaughlin will be retiring, and will be eligible to offer themselves for re-election at the 
AGM on September 21, 2012.  Mr. Paolo Pietrogrande will also be retiring,  but will not be offering 
himself for re-election at the next AGM.
 In accordance with the recommendations of the 2010 Code, Mr. Declan McKeon is Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and Mr. James Osborne, the senior non-executive director, is Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee.
 Senior Management regularly briefs the Board including new members in relation to operating, financial 
and strategic issues concerning the Company. The Board also have direct access to senior management as 
required in relation to any issues they have concerning the operation of the Company. The terms and 
conditions of appointment of non-executive directors are set out in their letters of appointment, which 
are available for inspection at the Company's registered office during normal office hours and at the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company.
 Independence
 The Board has carried out its annual evaluation of the independence of each of its non-executive 
directors, taking account of the relevant provisions of the 2010 Code, namely, whether the directors are 
independent in character andjudgement and free from relationships or circumstances which are likely to 
affect, or could appear to affect, the directors' judgment. The Board regards all of the directors as 
independent and that no one individual or one grouping exerts an undue influence on others.
 The Board has considered Mr. Kyran McLaughlin's independence given his role as Deputy Chairman and Head 
of Capital Markets at Davy Stockbrokers. Davy Stockbrokers are one of Ryanair's corporate brokers and 
provide corporate advisory services to Ryanair from time to time. The Board has considered the fees paid 
to Davy Stockbrokers for these services and believe that they are immaterial to both Ryanair and Davy 
Stockbrokers given the size of each organisation's business operations and financial results. Having 
considered this relationship, the Board has concluded that Mr. Kyran McLaughlin continues to be an 
independent non-executive director within the spirit and meaning of the 2010 Code Rules.
 The Board has also considered the independence of Mr. David Bonderman given his shareholding in Ryanair 
Holdings plc. As at March, 31 2012, Mr. David Bonderman had a beneficial shareholding in the Company of 
9,230,671 ordinary shares, equivalent to 0.63% of the issued share capital. Having considered this 
shareholding in light of the number of issued shares in Ryanair Holdings plc and the financial interest of 
the director, the Board has concluded that the interest is not so material as to breach the spirit of the 
independence rule contained in the 2010 Code.

 As explained in Note 1 on page 137 of the consolidated financial statements, the Group, in addition to 
complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, has also prepared its 
consolidated financial statements in compliance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. In our opinion, the 
consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the 
IASB, of the state of the Group's affairs as at March 31, 2012 and of its profit for the year then ended.
 We have obtained all the information and explanations which we considered necessary for the purposes of 
our audit. In our opinion, proper books of account have been kept by the Company. The Company's balance 
sheet is in agreement with the books of account.
 In our opinion, the information given in the Directors' Report and the description in the annual 
corporate governance statement of the main features of the internal control and risk management systems in 
relation to the process for preparing the consolidated group financial statements is consistent with the 
financial statements.
 The net assets of the Company as stated in the Company balance sheet on page 186 are more than half of 
the amount of its called up share capital, and, in our opinion, on that basis, there did not exist at 
March 31, 2012, a financial situation which, under Section 40(1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983, 
would require the convening of an extraordinary general meeting of the Company.

Body
 Ryanair Holdings' capital stock consists of Ordinary Shares, each having a par value of 0.635 euro cent. As of 
March 31, 2012, a total of 1,455,593,261 Ordinary Shares were outstanding. On February 26, 2007, Ryanair 
effected a 2-for-1 share split as a result of which each of its then existing Ordinary Shares, par value 1.27 euro cent, 
was split into two new Ordinary Shares, par value 0.635 euro cent. Each Ordinary Share entitles the holder thereof 
to one vote in respect of any matter voted upon by Ryanair Holdings' shareholders.
 OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES FROM REGISTRANT OR SUBSIDIARIES
 Ryanair Holdings' shareholders approved a stock option plan (referred to herein as "Option Plan 2000"), under 
which all employees and directors are eligible to receive options. Grants of options were permitted to take place at 
the close of any of the ten years beginning with fiscal year 2000 only if the Company's net profit after tax for such 
fiscal year had exceeded its net profit after tax for the prior fiscal year by at least 25%, or if an increase of 1% in net 
profit after tax for the relevant year would have resulted in such requirement being met.
 Ryanair Holdings' shareholders have also approved a stock option plan (referred to herein as "Option Plan 2003") 
established in accordance with a then tax-favorable share option scheme available under Irish law, so that 
employees would not be subject to income tax on the exercise of options (subject to certain conditions). Option Plan 
2003 was approved by the Revenue Commissioners on July 4, 2003 for the purposes of Chapter 4, Part 17, of the 
Irish Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 and Schedule 12C of that act. Following the publication of the Irish National 
Recovery Plan: 2011-2014 (the "NRP") on November 24, 2010, Revenue approved share option plans, such as 
Option Plan 2003, no longer qualified for favorable tax treatment from that date. All employees and full-time 
directors are eligible to participate in the plan, under which grants of options may be made at the close of any of the 
ten years beginning with fiscal year 2002 only if the Company's net profit after tax for such fiscal year has exceeded 
its net profit after tax for the prior fiscal year by at least 25%, or if an increase of 1% in net profit after tax for the 
relevant year would have resulted in such requirement being met.
 Under Option Plan 2000, 20 senior managers (including seven of the current executive officers) were granted 
10,500,000 share options, in the aggregate, at a strike price of EUR3.21 in July 2005. These options have either 
become exercisable or will become exercisable between August 1, 2010 and August 31, 2013, subject to certain 
targets being achieved and other conditions being complied with. Not all of the vesting conditions have been met, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -52-
and as a result only 80% of the options granted that satisfied the conditions were exercisable.  The Company 
recognized a credit of EUR2.5 million in relation to the options that did not vest in June 2011. Also, under Option 
Plan 2000, each of the non-executive directors were granted 25,000 share options, at a strike price of EUR4.96, 
during the 2008 fiscal year. These options will become exercisable between June 2012 and June 2014. In addition, 
39 senior managers (including eight of the current executive officers) were granted 10,000,000 share options, in the 
aggregate, under Option Plan 2000, at a strike price of EUR2.56, on September 18, 2008. These options will 
become exercisable between September 18, 2013 and September 17, 2015, but only for managers who continue to 
be employed by the Company through September 18, 2013.
 Under Option Plan 2003, 47 senior managers (including seven of the current executive officers) were granted 
5,550,000 share options at a strike price of EUR2.35 on November 3, 2004. These options, which became 
exercisable in June 2009, had to be fully exercised by June 30, 2011.
 The aggregate of 17,912,382 Ordinary Shares that would be issuable upon exercise in full of the options that were 
outstanding as of June 30, 2012 under Company's option plan represent approximately 1.2% of the issued share 
capital of Ryanair Holdings as of such date. Of such total, options in respect of an aggregate of 9,505,000 Ordinary 
Shares were held by the directors and executive officers of Ryanair Holdings. For further information, see notes 15 
and 19 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
 ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
 The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Articles of Association of Ryanair Holdings. This summary 
does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Articles, 
which are included as an exhibit to this annual report.
 Objects. Ryanair Holdings' objects, which are detailed in its Articles, are broad and include carrying on business as 
an investment and holding company. Ryanair Holdings' Irish company registration number is 249885.
 Directors. Subject to certain exceptions, directors may not vote on matters in which they have a material interest. 
The ordinary remuneration of the directors is determined from time to time by ordinary resolutions of the 
shareholders. Any director who holds any executive office, serves on any committee or otherwise performs 
services, which, in the opinion of the directors, are outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a director, may be 
paid such extra remuneration as the directors may determine. The directors may exercise all the powers of the 
Company to borrow money. These powers may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The 
directors are not required to retire at any particular age. There is no requirement for directors to hold shares. One-
third of the directors retire and offer themselves for re-election at each annual general meeting of the Company. 
The directors to retire by rotation are those who have been longest in office since their last appointment or 
reappointment. As between persons who became or were appointed directors on the same date, those to retire are 
determined by agreement between them or, otherwise, by lot. All of the shareholders entitled to attend and vote at 
the annual general meeting of the Company may vote on the re-election of directors.
 Annual and General Meetings. Annual and extraordinary meetings are called upon 21 days' advance notice. At 
Ryanair's annual general meeting, held on September 22, 2010, the Company's Articles of Association were 
amended by special resolution to reflect the implementation of the Shareholders' Rights (Directive 2007/36/EC) 
Regulations 2009 to allow all Ryanair shareholders to appoint proxies electronically to attend, speak, ask questions 
and vote on behalf of them at annual general meetings and to reflect certain other provisions of those Regulations. 
All holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to attend, speak at and vote at general meetings of the Company, 
subject to limitations described below under "-Limitations on the Right to Own Shares."
 Rights, Preferences and Dividends Attaching to Shares. The Company has only one class of shares, Ordinary 
Shares with a par value of 0.635 euro cent per share. All such shares rank equally with respect to payment of 
dividends and on any winding-up of the Company. Any dividend, interest or other sum payable to a shareholder that 
remains unclaimed for one year after having been declared may be invested by the directors for the benefit of the 
Company until claimed. If the directors so resolve, any dividend which has remained unclaimed for 12 years from 
the date of its declaration shall be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company. The Company is permitted 
under its Articles to issue redeemable shares on such terms and in such manner as the Company may, by special 
resolution, determine. The Ordinary Shares currently in issue are not redeemable. The liability of shareholders to 
invest additional capital is limited to the amounts remaining unpaid on the shares held by them. There are no 
sinking fund provisions in the Articles of the Company.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -52-
 Action Necessary to Change the Rights of Shareholders. The rights attaching to shares in the Company may be 
varied by special resolutions passed at meetings of the shareholders of the Company.
 Limitations on the Rights to Own Shares. The Articles contain detailed provisions enabling the directors of the 
Company to limit the number of shares in which non-EU nationals have an interest or the exercise by non-EU 
nationals of rights attaching to shares. See "-Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals" below. Such 
powers may be exercised by the directors if they are of the view that any license, consent, permit or privilege of the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries that enables it to operate an air service may be refused, withheld, suspended or 
revoked or have conditions attached to it that inhibit its exercise and the exercise of the powers referred to above 
could prevent such an occurrence. The exercise of such powers could result in non-EU holders of shares being 
prevented from attending, speaking at or voting at general meetings of the Company and/or being required to 
dispose of shares held by them to EU nationals.
 Disclosure of Share Ownership. Under Irish law, the Company can require parties to disclose their interests in 
shares. The Articles of the Company entitle the directors to require parties to complete declarations indicating their 
nationality and the nature and extent of any interest which such parties hold in Ordinary Shares before allowing 
such parties to transfer such Ordinary Shares. See, also "-Limitations on Share Ownership by non-EU nationals" 
below. Under Irish law, if a party acquires or disposes of Ordinary Shares so as to bring his interest above or below 
5% of the total issued share capital of the Company, he must notify the Company of that. The Irish Stock Exchange 
must also be notified of any acquisition or disposal of shares that brings the shareholding of a party above or below 
certain specified percentages - i.e., 10%, 25%, 50% and 70%.

Body
 Airline Industry Margins are Subject to Significant Uncertainty. The airline industry is capital intensive and is 
characterized by high fixed costs and by revenues that generally exhibit substantially greater elasticity than costs. 
Although fuel accounted for approximately 43% of total operating expenses in the 2012 fiscal year, management 
anticipates that this percentage may vary significantly in future years. See "-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel 
Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Losses" above. 
The operating costs of each flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers flown, and therefore, a 
relatively small change in the number of passengers, fare pricing, or traffic mix could have a disproportionate effect 
on operating and financial results. Accordingly, a relatively minor shortfall from expected revenue levels could have 
a material adverse effect on the Company's growth or financial performance. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial 
Review and Prospects." The very low marginal costs incurred for providing services to passengers occupying 
otherwise unsold seats are also a factor in the industry's high susceptibility to price discounting. See "-The 
Company Faces Significant Price and Other Pressures in a Highly Competitive Environment" above.
 Safety-Related Undertakings Could Affect the Company's Results. Aviation authorities in Europe and the United 
States periodically require or suggest that airlines implement certain safety-related procedures on their aircraft. In 
recent years, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA") has required a number of such procedures with 
regard to Boeing 737-800 aircraft, including checks of rear pressure bulkheads and flight control modules, redesign 
of the rudder control system, and limitations on certain operating procedures. Ryanair's policy is to implement any 
such required procedures in accordance with FAA guidance and to perform such procedures in close collaboration 
with Boeing. To date, all such procedures have been conducted as part of Ryanair's standard maintenance 
program and have not interrupted flight schedules nor required any material increases in Ryanair's maintenance 
expenses. However, there can be no assurance that the FAA or other regulatory authorities will not recommend or 
require other safety-related undertakings or that such undertakings would not adversely impact the Company's 
operating results or financial condition.
 There also can be no assurance that new regulations will not be implemented in the future that would apply to 
Ryanair's aircraft and result in an increase in Ryanair's cost of maintenance or other costs beyond management's 
current estimates. In addition, should Ryanair's aircraft cease to be sufficiently reliable or should any public 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -22-
perception develop that Ryanair's aircraft are less than completely reliable, the Company's business could be 
materially adversely affected.
 Risks Related to Ownership of the Company's Ordinary Shares or ADRs
 EU Rules Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals, and 
the Company Has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals. EU Regulation No. 
1008/2008 requires that, in order to obtain and retain an operating license, an EU air carrier must be majority-
owned and effectively controlled by EU nationals. The regulation does not specify what level of share ownership will 
confer effective control on a holder or holders of Ordinary Shares. The Board of Directors of Ryanair Holdings is 
given certain powers under Ryanair Holdings' articles of association (the "Articles") to take action to ensure that the 
number of Ordinary Shares held in Ryanair Holdings by non-EU nationals ("Affected Shares") does not reach a 
level that could jeopardize the Company's entitlement to continue to hold or enjoy the benefit of any license, permit, 
consent, or privilege which it holds or enjoys and which enables it to carry on business as an air carrier. The 
directors, from time to time, set a "Permitted Maximum" on the number of the Company's Ordinary Shares that may 
be owned by non-EU nationals at such level as they believe will comply with EU law. The Permitted Maximum is 
currently set at 49.9%. In addition, under certain circumstances, the directors can take action to safeguard the 
Company's ability to operate by identifying those Ordinary Shares, American Depositary Shares ("ADSs") or 
Affected Shares which give rise to the need to take action and treat such Ordinary Shares, the American Depositary 
Receipts ("ADRs") evidencing such ADSs, or Affected Shares as "Restricted Shares." The Board of Directors may, 
under certain circumstances, deprive holders of Restricted Shares of their rights to attend, vote at, and speak at 
general meetings, and/or require such holders to dispose of their Restricted Shares to an EU national within as little 
as 21 days. The directors are also given the power to transfer such Restricted Shares themselves if a holder fails to 
comply. In 2002, the Company implemented measures to restrict the ability of non-EU nationals to purchase 
Ordinary Shares, and non-EU nationals are currently effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary Shares, and will 
remain so for as long as these restrictions remain in place. There can be no assurance that these restrictions will 
ever be lifted. Additionally, these foreign ownership restrictions could result in Ryanair's exclusion from certain stock 
tracking indices. Any such exclusion may adversely affect the market price of the Ordinary Shares and ADRs. On 
April 19, 2012, the Company obtained shareholder approval to repurchase ADRs as part of its general authority to 
repurchase up to 5% of the issued share capital in the Company traded on the NASDAQ.  See "Item 10. Additional 
Information-Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals" for a detailed discussion of restrictions on share 
ownership and the current ban on share purchases by non-EU nationals. As of June 30, 2012, EU nationals owned 
at least 54.17% of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares (assuming conversion of all outstanding ADRs into Ordinary 
Shares).
 Holders of Ordinary Shares are Currently Unable to Convert those Shares into American Depositary Receipts. In 
an effort to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, on June 26, 2001, Ryanair Holdings 
instructed The Bank of New York Mellon, the depositary for its ADR program (the "Depositary"), to suspend the 
issuance of new ADRs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary Shares until further notice. Holders of Ordinary 
Shares cannot convert their Ordinary Shares into ADRs during this suspension, and there can be no assurance that 
the suspension will ever be lifted. See also "-EU Rules Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' 
Ordinary Shares by Non-EU nationals and the Company has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares 
by Non-EU Nationals" above.
 The Company's Results of Operations May Fluctuate Significantly. The Company's results of operations have 
varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. See "Item 5. 
Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Seasonal Fluctuations." Among the factors causing these variations 
are the airline industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions, the seasonal nature of air travel, and trends in 
airlines' costs, especially fuel costs. Because a substantial portion of airline travel (both business and personal) is 
discretionary, the industry tends to experience adverse financial results during general economic downturns. The 
Company is substantially dependent on discretionary air travel.
 The trading price of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares and ADRs may be subject to wide fluctuations in response 
to quarterly variations in the Company's operating results and the operating results of other airlines. In addition, the 
global stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -22-
prices of many airline company stocks. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of 
the Ordinary Shares and ADRs.
 Ryanair Holdings May or May Not Pay Dividends. Since its incorporation as the holding company for Ryanair in 
1996, Ryanair Holdings has only twice declared dividends on its Ordinary Shares. The directors of the Company 
declared on June 1, 2010 that Ryanair Holdings intended to pay a special dividend of EUR500 million, and following 
shareholder approval at its annual general meeting on September 22, 2010 this special dividend was paid on 
October 1, 2010. Directors of the Company also declared on May 21, 2012 that Ryanair Holdings intended to pay a 
special dividend of EUR0.34 per ordinary share (approx EUR489 million) in November 2012 subject to shareholder 
approval at the annual general meeting on September 21, 2012. The Company may ultimately determine not to pay 
any such dividend, or may fail to obtain shareholder approval (where required). The Company may pay other 
dividends from time to time, or it may not pay any dividends at all, as has been its general practice to date. No 
assurances can be given that the Company will, or will not, pay dividends. See "Item 8. Financial Information-Other 
Financial Information-Dividend Policy." As a holding company, Ryanair Holdings does not have any material assets 
other than the shares of Ryanair.

Body
 In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, Ryanair has primarily relied on its own and 
industry experience, recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of all of the Company's aircraft, valuations 
from appraisers and other available marketplace information. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can 
be significant, could be caused by changes to Ryanair's maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft, 
governmental regulations on aging of aircraft, changes in new aircraft technology, changes in governmental and 
environmental taxes, changes in new aircraft fuel efficiency and changing market prices for new and used aircraft of 
the same or similar types. Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period, and, when 
warranted, adjusts these assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis, 
through depreciation expense.
 Ryanair periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment 
would include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an aircraft, a significant change in 
an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the aircraft. While the 
airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these factors from time to time, Ryanair has not yet been 
seriously impacted and continues to record positive cash flows from these long-lived assets. Consequently, Ryanair 
has not yet identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its 
long-lived assets and the general airline operating environment.
 The Company's estimate of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values is 15% of current market value of 
new aircraft, determined periodically, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft disposals during prior 
periods. Aircraft are depreciated over a useful life of 23 years from the date of manufacture to residual value.
 Heavy Maintenance
 An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed, on acquisition, to its service potential, reflecting the 
maintenance condition of the engines and airframe.
 For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return the aircraft 
in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the airframe, engines and life-
limited parts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, maintenance, in the form of major airframe 
overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, is required to be performed during 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -36-
the period of the lease and upon return of the aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance 
costs and the costs associated with the restitution of major life-limited parts, are accrued and charged to profit or 
loss over the lease term for this contractual obligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of 
the major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by 
reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year.
 Ryanair's aircraft operating lease agreements typically have a term of seven years, which closely correlates with 
the timing of heavy maintenance checks. The contractual obligation to maintain and replenish aircraft held under 
operating lease exists independently of any future actions within the control of Ryanair. While Ryanair may, in very 
limited circumstances, sub-lease its aircraft, it remains fully liable to perform all of its contractual obligations under 
the 'head lease' notwithstanding any such sub-leasing.
 Both of these elements of accounting policies involve the use of estimates in determining the quantum of both the 
initial maintenance asset and/or the amount of provisions to be recorded and the respective periods over which 
such amounts are charged to income. In making such estimates, Ryanair has primarily relied on its own and 
industry experience, industry regulations and recommendations from Boeing; however, these estimates can be 
subject to revision, depending on a number of factors, such as the timing of the planned maintenance, the ultimate 
utilization of the aircraft, changes to government regulations and increases or decreases in estimated costs. 
Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts its 
assumptions, which generally impact maintenance and depreciation expense in the income statement on a 
prospective basis.
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 The following table sets forth certain income statement data (calculated under IFRS) for Ryanair expressed as a

 ==========  =========  =========
FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011
 Profit after taxation. Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR560.4 million in the 2012 
fiscal year, as compared with a profit of EUR374.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year. This profit was primarily 
attributable to an increase in revenues driven by a 15.6% increase in average fares and a 10.6% increase in 
ancillary revenues, partially offset by a 29.9% increase in fuel and oil costs from EUR1,227.0 million to EUR1,593.6 
million.
 Scheduled revenues. Ryanair's scheduled passenger revenues increased 23.9%, from EUR2,827.9 million in the 
2011 fiscal year, to EUR3,504.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, primarily reflecting an increase of 15.6% in average 
fares. The number of passengers booked increased 5.2%, from 72.1 million to 75.8 million, reflecting increased 
passenger volumes on existing routes and the successful launch of new bases at Manchester, Wroclaw, Baden-
Baden, Billund, Palma, Paphos and Budapest in the 2012 fiscal year. There was a one percentage point decrease 
in booked passenger load factors from 83% in fiscal 2011 to 82% in fiscal 2012.
 Passenger capacity (as measured in ASMs) during the 2012 fiscal year increased by 12.3% due to the addition of 
22 Boeing 737-800 aircraft (net of handbacks), as well as a 5.8% increase in sectors flown and a 6.1% increase in 
the average length of passenger haul. Scheduled passenger revenues accounted for 79.8% of Ryanair's total 
revenues for the 2012 fiscal year, compared with 77.9% of total revenues in the 2011 fiscal year.
 During fiscal year 2012, changes in estimates relating to the timing of revenue recognition for unused passenger 
tickets were made, resulting in increased revenue in the 2012 fiscal year of EUR65.3 million.  This change reflects 
more accurate and timely data obtained through system enhancements.

Body
 The Board has further considered the independence of Mr. David Bonderman, Mr. James Osborne, Mr. Kyran 
McLaughlin, Mr. Michael Horgan, Mr. Klaus Kirchberger and Mr. Paolo Pietrogrande as they have each served 
more than nine years on the Board. The Board considers that each of these directors is independent in 
character and judgment as each has other significant commercial and professional commitments and each 
brings his own level of senior experience gained in their fields of international business and 
professional practice. When arriving at this decision, the Board has taken into account the comments made 
by the FRC in their report dated December, 2009 on their review of the impact and effectiveness of the 
2010 Code, in particular their comment that independence is not the primary consideration when assessing 
the composition of the Board, and that the over-riding consideration should be that the Board is fit for 
purpose. For these reasons, and also because each director's independence is considered annually by the 
Board, the Board considers it appropriate that these directors have not been offered for annual re-
election as is recommended by the 2010 Code.
 Board Procedures
 All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and the Board has 
established a procedure whereby directors wishing to obtain advice in the furtherance of their duties may 
take independent professional advice at the Company's expense.
 Directors meet with key executives with a particular focus on ensuring non-executive directors are fully 
informed on issues of relevance to Ryanair and its operations. Extensive papers on key business issues are 
provided to all directors in connection with the Board meetings. All directors are encouraged to update 
and refresh their skills and knowledge, for example, through attending courses on technical areas or 
external briefings for non-executive directors.
 The Company has Directors & Officers liability insurance in place in respect of any legal actions taken 
against the directors in the course of the exercise of their duties. New non-executive directors are 
encouraged to meet the executive director and senior management for briefing on the Company's developments 
and plans.
 Meetings
 The Board meets at least on a quarterly basis and in the year to March 31, 2012 the Board met on nine 
occasions. Individual attendance at these meetings is set out in the table on page 22. Detailed Board 
papers are circulated in advance so that Board members have adequate time and information to be able to 
participate fully at the meeting.
 The holding of detailed regular Board meetings and the fact that many matters require Board approval, 
indicate that the running of the Company is firmly in the hands of the Board. The non-executive directors 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -6-
meet periodically without executives being present. Led by the senior independent director, the non-
executive directors will meet without the chairman present at least annually to appraise the chairman's 
performance and on such other occasions as are deemed appropriate.
 Remuneration
 Details of remuneration paid to the directors are set out in Note 19 to the consolidated Financial 
Statements on pages 174 to 176. Also, please see the Report of the Remuneration Committee on Directors' 
Remuneration on page 27.
 Non-executive directors
 Non-executive directors are remunerated by way of directors' fees and share options. While the 2010 Code 
notes that the remuneration of the non-executive director should not include share options, the Board 
believes that the quantum of options granted to non-executive directors is not so significant as to raise 
any issue concerning their independence. Mr. Michael Horgan is remunerated on a consultancy basis on 
safety issues and also by way of share options.
 Full details are disclosed in Note 19(b) and 19(d) on pages 175 to 176 of the consolidated financial 
statements.
 Executive director remuneration
 The Chief Executive of the Company is the only executive director on the Board. In addition to his base 
salary he is eligible for a performance bonus of up to 50% of salary and other bonuses dependent upon the 
achievement of certain financial targets and a pension. It is considered that the shareholding of the 
Chief Executive acts to align his interests with those of shareholders and gives him a keen incentive to 
perform to the highest levels.
 Full details of the executive director's remuneration are set out in Note 19(a) on page 175 of the 
consolidated financial statements.
 Share Ownership and Dealing
 Details of the directors' interests in Ryanair shares are set out in Note 19(d) on page 176 of the 
consolidated financial statements.
 The Board has adopted The Model Code, as set out in the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange and the 
UK Listing Authority, as the code of dealings applicable to dealings in Ryanair shares by directors and 
relevant Company employees. The code of dealing also includes provisions which are intended to ensure 
compliance with US securities laws and regulations of the NASDAQ National market. Under the policy, 
directors are required to obtain clearance from the Chairman or Chief Executive before dealing in Ryanair 
shares, whilst relevant Company employees must obtain clearance from designated senior management and are 
prohibited from dealing in the shares during prohibited periods as defined by the Listing Rules and at any 
time at which the individual is in possession of inside information (as defined in the Market Abuse 
(Directive 2003/6/EC) Regulations 2005).
 Board Succession and Structure
 The Board plans for its own succession with guidance from the Nomination Committee. The Nomination 
Committee regularly review the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge and 
experience) required of the Board compared to its current position with regard to the strategic needs of 
Ryanair and recommends changes to the Board. The Nomination Committee consider candidates for the Board on 
merit and against objective criteria to ensure that candidates have the skills, knowledge and expertise 
required by the Board, taking care that appointees have enough time available to devote to the position.
 The Board currently comprises of nine directors, Chief Executive Officer Mr. Michael O' Leary is the only 
executive director. The eight non-executive directors include Chairman Mr. David Bonderman. Biographies of 
all current directors are set out on pages 96 of this report. Ryanair considers that the Board has the 
correct balance and depth of skills, knowledge, expertise and experience to optimally lead the Company and 
that all directors give adequate time to the performance of their duties and responsibilities.
 Ryanair considers that all directors discharge their directorial duties with the objectivity and 
impartiality they have demonstrated since commencing their respective roles and has determined that each 
of the non-executive Directors is independent. In reaching that conclusion, Ryanair considered the 
character, judgement, objectivity and integrity of each director and had due regard for the 2010 Code. 
Ryanair continually endeavors to maintain the quality and independence of its Board. Two new independent 
directors Mr. Charles McCreevy and Mr. Declan McKeon were appointed in May 2010.
 Board Committees
 The Board of Directors has established a number of committees, including the following:
 Executive Committee
 The Board of Directors established the Executive Committee in August 1996. The Executive Committee can 
exercise the powers exercisable by the full Board of Directors in circumstances in which action by the 
Board of Directors is required but it is impracticable to convene a meeting of the full Board of 
Directors. Messrs. David Bonderman, Michael O'Leary, Kyran McLaughlin and James Osborne are the members of 
the Executive Committee.
 Audit Committee
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -6-
 The Board of Directors established the Audit Committee in September 1996. The Audit Committee currently 
comprises three independent non-executive directors, Mr. Declan McKeon (Chairman), Mr. Charles McCreevy 
and Mr. James Osborne, considered by the Board to be independent. The Board has determined that Mr. Declan 
McKeon is the Committee's financial expert.

Financial Officer, Finance Director, Financial Controller, Company Secretary and the Head of Internal 
Audit normally attend meetings of the Committee.  The external auditors attend as required and have direct 
access to the Committee Chairman at all times. The Committee also meets separately at least once a year 
with the external auditors and with the Head of Internal Audit without executive management being present.
 The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in its written terms of reference, which 
are available on the Company's website www.ryanair.com, and include:

 Performance Evaluation
 The Board has established a formal process to annually evaluate the performance of the Board, that of its 
principal Committees, the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees, and that of the Chief Executive,  
the Chairman and individual non-executive directors. The Board anticipates that the formal evaluation will 
be completed yearly. Based on the evaluation process completed, the Board considers that the principal 
Committees have performed effectively throughout the year. As part of the Board evaluation of its own 
performance, questionnaires are circulated to all directors. The questionnaire is designed to obtain 
directors' comments regarding the performance of the Board, the effectiveness of Board communications, the 
ability of directors to contribute to the development of strategy and the effectiveness with which the 
Board monitors risk and oversees Ryanair's progress.  Directors are also invited to make recommendations 
for improvement.

Body
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and 
various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and the results of such estimates form the 
basis of judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. A revision to an accounting estimate is recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if 
the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if these are also affected. 
Principal sources of estimation uncertainty have been set forth in the critical accounting policies section below. 
Actual results may differ from estimates.
 The Company believes that its critical accounting policies, which are those that require management's most 
difficult, subjective and complex judgements, are those described in this section. These critical accounting policies, 
the judgements and other uncertainties affecting application of these policies and the sensitivity of reported results 
to changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered in reviewing the consolidated financial 
statements.
 Long-lived assets
 As of March 31, 2012, Ryanair had EUR4.9billion of property, plant and equipment long-lived assets, virtually all of 
which consisted of aircraft. In accounting for long-lived assets, Ryanair must make estimates about the expected 
useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the 
fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate.
 In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, Ryanair has primarily relied on its own and 
industry experience, recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of all of the Company's aircraft, and other 
data available in the marketplace. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be 
caused by changes to Ryanair's maintenance program, changes in utilisation of the aircraft, changes to 
governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices for new and used aircraft of the same or 
similar types. Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period, and, when warranted, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -64-
adjusts these assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis, through 
depreciation expense.
 Ryanair periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment 
would include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an aircraft, a significant change in 
an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the aircraft. While the 
airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these factors from time to time, Ryanair has not yet been 
seriously impacted and continues to record positive cash flows from these long-lived assets. Consequently, Ryanair 
has not yet identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its 
long-lived assets and the general airline operating environment.
 The Company's estimate of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values is 15% of current market value of 
new aircraft, determined periodically, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft disposals during prior 
periods. Aircraft are depreciated over a useful life of 23 years from the date of manufacture to residual value.
 Heavy maintenance
 An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed, on acquisition, to its service potential, reflecting the 
maintenance condition of the engines and airframe.
 For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return the aircraft 
in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the airframe, engines and life-
limited parts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, maintenance, in the form of major airframe 
overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, is required to be performed during 
the period of the lease and upon return of the aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance 
costs and the costs associated with the restitution of major life-limited parts, are accrued and charged to profit or 
loss over the lease term for this contractual obligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of 
the major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by 
reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year.
 Ryanair's aircraft operating lease agreements typically have a term of seven years, which closely correlates with 
the timing of heavy maintenance checks. The contractual obligation to maintain and replenish aircraft held under 
operating lease exists independently of any future actions within the control of Ryanair.  While Ryanair may, in very 
limited circumstances, sub-lease its aircraft, it remains fully liable to perform all of its contractual obligations under 
the 'head lease' notwithstanding any such sub-leasing.
 Both of these elements of accounting policies involve the use of estimates in determining the quantum of both the 
initial maintenance asset and/or the amount of provisions to be recorded and the respective periods over which 
such amounts are charged to income. In making such estimates, Ryanair has primarily relied on its own and 
industry experience, industry regulations and recommendations from Boeing; however, these estimates can be 
subject to revision, depending on a number of factors, such as the timing of the planned maintenance, the ultimate 
utilisation of the aircraft, changes to government regulations and increases or decreases in estimated costs. 
Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts its 
assumptions, which generally impact maintenance and depreciation expense in the income statement on a 
prospective basis.
 Basis of consolidation
 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Ryanair Holdings plc and its subsidiary 
undertakings as of March 31, 2012. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by Ryanair. Control exists when Ryanair has 
the power either directly or indirectly to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
benefit from its activities.
 All inter-company account balances and any unrealised income or expenses arising from intra-group transactions 
have been eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
 The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated 
income statement from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. Upon the acquisition of a business, fair 
values are attributed to the separable net assets acquired.
 Business combinations
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -64-
 Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date 
on which control is transferred to the Company. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
 Acquisitions on or after April 1, 2010
 For acquisitions on or after January 1, 2010, the Company measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair 
value of the consideration transferred, plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, 
less the net recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
 Acquisitions between January 1, 2004 and April 1, 2010
 For acquisitions between January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the 
acquisition over the Company's interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the acquiree.
 Acquisitions prior to January 1, 2004 (date of transition to IFRSs)
 As part of its transition to the IFRSs, the Company elected to restate only those business combinations that 
occurred on or after January 1, 2003. Prior to January 1, 2003, goodwill represented the amount recognised under 
the Company's previous accounting framework, Irish GAAP.
 Foreign currency translation
 Items included in the financial statements of each of the group entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the majority of the group entities.
 Transactions arising in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies at the rates of 
exchange in effect at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to euro at foreign exchange rates in effect at the dates 
the transactions were effected. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, 
except for differences arising on qualifying cash-flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Company, to consider internal control procedures and to liaise with internal and external auditors. In the 
year ended March 31, 2012 the Audit Committee met on six occasions. On a semi-annual basis the Audit 
Committee receives an extensive report from the internal auditor detailing the reviews performed in the 
year, and a risk assessment of the Company. This report is used by the Audit Committee and the Board, as a 
basis for determining the effectiveness of internal control. The Audit Committee regularly considers the 
performance of internal audit and how best financial reporting and internal control principles should be 
applied.
 In addition, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing

 ===========  ==============  =============                  ==============
The "Basic Price" (equivalent to a standard list price for an aircraft of this type) for each aircraft governed by the 
2005 Boeing contract will be increased by (a) an estimated U.S.$900,000 per aircraft for certain "buyer furnished" 
equipment the Company has asked Boeing to purchase and install on each of the aircraft, and (b) an "Escalation 
Factor" designed to increase the Basic Price, as defined in the purchase agreement, of any individual aircraft by 
applying a formula which reflects increases in the published U.S. Employment Cost and Producer Price indices 
between the time the Basic Price was set and the period of six months prior to the delivery of such aircraft.
 Boeing has granted Ryanair certain price concessions with regard to the Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft. 
These take the form of credit memoranda to the Company for the amount of such concessions, which the Company 
may apply toward the purchase of goods and services from Boeing or toward certain payments, in respect of the 
purchase of the aircraft under the various Boeing contracts.
 Boeing and CFMI (the manufacturer of the engines to be fitted on the purchased aircraft) have also agreed to give 
the Company certain allowances in addition to providing other goods and services to the Company on 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -90-
concessionary terms. These credit memoranda and allowances will effectively reduce the price of each aircraft to 
the Company. As a result, the effective price of each aircraft will be significantly below the Basic Price mentioned 
above. At March 31, 2012, the total potential commitment to acquire all 15 "firm" aircraft, not taking such increases 
and decreases into account, will be up to U.S.$0.8 billion.  (At March 31, 2011, the total potential commitment was 
U.S.$2.0 billion to acquire all 40 "firm" aircraft).
 Operating leases
 The Company financed 72 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between December 2003 and March 2012 
under seven-year, sale-and-leaseback arrangements with a number of international leasing companies, pursuant to 
which each lessor purchased an aircraft and leased it to Ryanair under an operating lease. Between October 2010 
and December 2012, 13 operating lease aircraft were returned to the lessor at the agreed maturity date of the 
lease. At March 31, 2012 Ryanair had 59 operating lease aircraft in the fleet. As a result, Ryanair operates, but 
does not own, these aircraft. Ryanair has no right or obligation to acquire these aircraft at the end of the relevant 
lease terms. Two of these leases are denominated in euro and require Ryanair to make variable rental payments 
that are linked to EURIBOR. Through the use of interest rate swaps, Ryanair has effectively converted the floating-
rate rental payments due under these two leases into fixed-rate rental payments. Another 30 leases are also 
denominated in euro and require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments over the term of the leases. 27 remaining 
operating leases are U.S. dollar-denominated, of which two require Ryanair to make variable rental payments that 
are linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR, while the remaining 25 require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments. The 
Company has an option to extend the initial period of seven years on 36 of the 59 remaining operating lease aircraft 
as at March 31, 2012, on pre-determined terms. Four operating lease arrangements will mature during the year 
ended March 31, 2013. The Company has decided not to extend any of these operating leases for a secondary 
lease period. The following table sets out the total future minimum payments of leasing 59 aircraft (2011: 51 aircraft; 
2010: 55 aircraft), ignoring movement in interest rates, foreign currency and hedging arrangements, at March 31, 
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively:

Finance leases
 The Company financed 30 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between March 2005 and March 2012 with 13-
year euro-denominated Japanese Operating Leases with Call Options ("JOLCOs"). These structures are accounted 
for as finance leases and are initially recorded at fair value in the Company's balance sheet. Under each of these 
contracts, Ryanair has a call option to purchase the aircraft at a pre-determined price after a period of 10.5 years, 
which it may exercise. The following table sets out the total future minimum payments of leasing 30 aircraft (2011: 
30 aircraft; 2010: 20 aircraft) under JOLCOs at March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively:

(a)    This includes the aircraft that was involved in the bird strike incident at Rome (Ciampino) airport 
in November 2008, which has not been sold and remains the property of Ryanair. The Company will not return 
this aircraft to service.
 (b)   As of June 30, 2012 the Company had sold and re-delivered a cumulative total 39 Boeing 737-800 
aircraft. The Company expects to dispose of 8 further aircraft before March 2014 (which, when added to the 
38 completed disposals, and the aircraft disabled by the bird strike and thus listed as a disposal, brings 
the total number of disposals to 47). To this end, the Company may choose to dispose of aircraft through 
sale and/or non-renewal of a number of operating leases due to expire between fiscal year 2012 and fiscal 
year 2013.
 As can be seen from the delivery schedule table above, delivery of the Boeing 737-800s already ordered 
will enable the Company to increase the size of its summer schedule fleet by 11 additional aircraft (net 
of planned disposals) in fiscal year 2013 thereby increasing the size of the fleet, which is expected to 
total 305 at the end of that period.
 Capital Resources. Ryanair's long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled EUR3,625.2 million at 
March 31, 2012 and EUR3,649.4 million at March 31, 2011, with the change being primarily attributable to 
financing of new aircraft and repayment of existing debt facilities. Please see the table "Obligations Due 
by Period" below for more information on Ryanair's long-term debt (including current maturities) and 
finance leases as of March 31, 2012. See also Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in 
Item 18 for further information on the maturity profile of the interest rate structure and other 
information on, the Company's borrowings.
 The Company's purchase of the 25 Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered in the 2012 fiscal year has been 
funded by a combination of financing solutions, including bank loans supported by Ex-Im Bank guarantees 
(14 aircraft) and sale-and-leaseback financings (11 aircraft). At March 31, 2012, the majority of the 
aircraft in Ryanair's fleet had been financed through loan facilities with various financial institutions 
active in the structured export finance sector and supported by a loan guarantee from Ex-Im Bank. Each of 
these facilities takes essentially the same form and is based on the documentation developed by Ryanair 
and Ex-Im Bank, which follows standard market forms for this type of financing. In November 2010, Ryanair 
financed seven aircraft through a U.S. dollar-denominated Ex-Im Bank Capital Markets Product ("Eximbond"). 
The Eximbond has essentially the same characteristics as all previous Ex-Im Bank guaranteed financings 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -41-
with no additional obligations on Ryanair. On the basis of an Ex-Im Bank guarantee with regard to the 
financing of up to 85% of the eligible U.S. and foreign content represented in the net purchase price of 
the relevant aircraft, the financial institution investor enters into a commitment letter with the Company 
to provide financing for a specified number of aircraft benefiting from such guarantee; loans are then 
drawn down as the aircraft are delivered and payments to Boeing become due. Each of the loans under the 
facilities are on substantially similar terms, having a maturity of 12 years from the drawdown date and 
being secured by a first priority mortgage in favor of a security trustee on behalf of Ex-Im Bank. As of 
July 20, 2012, the Company has a commitment for all 11 aircraft due for delivery on September, October and 
November 2012.
 Through the use of interest rate swaps or cross currency interest rate swaps, Ryanair has effectively 
converted a portion of its floating-rate debt under its financing facilities into fixed-rate debt. 
Approximately 36% of the loans for the aircraft acquired under the above facilities are not covered by 
such swaps and have therefore remained at floating rates linked to EURIBOR, with the interest rate 
exposure from these loans largely hedged by placing a similar amount of cash on deposit at floating 
interest rates. The net result is that Ryanair has effectively swapped or drawn down fixed-rate euro-
denominated debt with maturities between 7 and 12 years in respect of approximately 64% of its outstanding 
debt financing at March 31, 2012 and of this total approximately 44% of this debt has been partially 
swapped, with the relevant swaps covering the first 7 years of the 12-year amortizing period.
 The table below illustrates the effect of swap transactions (each of which is with an established 
international financial counterparty) on the profile of Ryanair's total outstanding debt at March 31, 
2012. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Exposure and 
Hedging" for additional details on the Company's hedging transactions.
At March 31, 2012                                                                   EUR          EUR

 Aer Lingus; (5) the fact that the ESOT (Employee Share Ownership Trust) which at the time of the 
unsuccessful 2006 offer controlled 15% of Aer Lingus, has been disbanded since December 2010 and the 
shares distributed to the individual members with the result that, Ryanair's new offer is, in Ryanair's 
view, capable of reaching over 50% acceptance either with or without the Irish government's acceptance;  
and (6) the fact that recently, Etihad, an Abu Dhabi based airline, has acquired a 3% stake in Aer Lingus 
and has expressed an interest in buying the Irish government's 25% stake in Aer Lingus (the offer now 
provides Etihad or any other potential bidder the opportunity to purchase the Irish government's stake). 
Ryanair is willing to offer the European Commission appropriate remedies to allay competition concerns and 
it believes that these remedies, as well as the efficiencies and synergies arising from the combination, 
should allow the Commission to approve this proposed merger.
 Ryanair has offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain the Aer Lingus brand, and to grow 
its traffic from 9.5 million to over 14.5 million passengers over a five year period post acquisition, by 
growing Aer Lingus' short haul traffic at some of Europe's major airports where Aer Lingus currently 
operates and Ryanair does not. Ryanair also intends to increase Aer Lingus' transatlantic traffic from 
Ireland, which has fallen in recent years, by investing in operations. If the offer is accepted, the Irish 
government would receive EUR173 million in cash. The offer of EUR1.30 per share represented a premium of 
approximately 38% over the closing price of EUR0.94 for Aer Lingus shares as of June 19, 2012.  The offer 
is conditional on competition approval by the European Commission. The Company anticipates that the EU 
merger review process will be completed between September 2012 and February 2013.
 Responding to Current Challenges. In recent periods, and with increased effect in the 2010, 2011 and 2012 
fiscal years, Ryanair's low-cost, low-fares model has faced substantial pressure due to significantly 
increased fuel costs and reduced economic growth (or economic contraction) in some of the economies in 
which it operates. The Company has aimed to meet these challenges by: (i) grounding (approximately 80) 
aircraft during the winter season; (ii) disposing of aircraft (disposals totaled three in the 2010 fiscal 
year, ten lease hand backs in the 2011 fiscal year and 3 lease hand backs in the 2012 fiscal year); (iii) 
controlling labor and other costs, including through wage freezes for non flight crew employees in 2010 
and 2011, selective redundancies and the introduction of Internet check-in; and (iv) renegotiating 
contracts with existing suppliers, airports and handling companies. There can be no assurance that the 
Company will be successful in achieving all of the foregoing or taking other similar measures, or that 
doing so will allow the Company to earn profits in any period. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-
Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's Results and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -25-
Increase the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Losses" and "-The Company May Not Be Successful in 
Raising Fares to Offset Increased Business Costs."
 In recent years, in response to an operating environment characterized by high fuel prices, typically 
lower seasonal yields and higher airport charges and/or taxes, Ryanair has adopted a policy of grounding a 
certain portion of its fleet during the winter months (from November to March inclusive). In the winter 
months of fiscal year 2012, Ryanair grounded approximately 80 aircraft and the Company announced in May 
2012 that it intends to ground approximately 80 aircraft during the winter months of fiscal year 2013.   
While seasonal grounding does reduce the Company's operating costs, it also decreases Ryanair's potential 
to record both flight and non-flight revenues. Decreasing the number and frequency of flights may also 
negatively affect the Company's labor relations, including its ability to attract flight personnel 
interested in full-time employment. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Ryanair Has Decided to 
Seasonally Ground Aircraft."
 ROUTE SYSTEM, SCHEDULING AND FARES
 Route System and Scheduling
 As of July 20, 2012, the Company offered over 1,500 scheduled short-haul flights per day serving 
approximately 160 airports largely throughout Europe, and flying approximately 1,500 routes. The following 
table lists Ryanair's bases of operations:

 See Note 17, "Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis," to the consolidated financial 
statements included in Item 18 for more information regarding the geographical sources of the Company's 
revenue.
 Management's objective is to schedule a sufficient number of flights per day on each of Ryanair's routes 
to satisfy demand for Ryanair's low-fares service. Ryanair schedules departures on its most popular routes 
at frequent intervals, normally between approximately 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. Management regularly 
reviews the need for adjustments in the number of flights on all of its routes.
 During the 2012 fiscal year, Ryanair announced 330 new routes across its network. See "Risk Factors-Risks 
Related to the Company-Ryanair Has Decided to Seasonally Ground Aircraft."
 Low and Widely Available Fares
 Ryanair offers low fares, with prices generally varying on the basis of advance booking, seat 
availability and demand. Ryanair sells seats on a one-way basis, thus removing minimum stay requirements 
from all travel on Ryanair scheduled services. All tickets can be changed, subject to certain conditions, 
including fee payment and applicable upgrade charges. However, tickets are generally non-cancelable and 
non-refundable and must be paid for at the time of reservation.
 Ryanair's discounted fares are "capacity controlled" in that Ryanair allocates a specific number of seats 
on each flight to each fare category to accommodate projected demand for seats at each fare level leading 
up to flight time. Ryanair generally makes its lowest fares widely available by allocating a majority of 
its seat inventory to its lowest fare categories. Management believes that its unrestricted fares as well 
as its advance-purchase fares are attractive to both business and leisure travelers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -25-
 When launching a new route, Ryanair's policy is to price its lowest fare so that it will be significantly 
lower than other carriers' lowest fares, but still provide a satisfactory operating margin.
 Ryanair also periodically runs special promotional fare campaigns, in particular in connection with the 
opening of new routes, and endeavors to always offer the lowest fare on any route it serves. Promotional 
fares may have the effect of increasing load factors and reducing Ryanair's yield and passenger revenues 
on the relevant routes during the periods they are in effect. Ryanair expects to continue to offer 
significant fare promotions to stimulate demand in periods of lower activity or during off-peak times for 
the foreseeable future.
 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING
 Ryanair's primary marketing strategy is to emphasize its widely available low fares and price guarantee. 
In doing so, Ryanair primarily advertises its services in national and regional newspapers, as well as 
through controversial and topical advertising, press conferences and publicity stunts. Other marketing 
activities include the distribution of advertising and promotional material and cooperative advertising 
campaigns with other travel-related entities, including local tourist boards. Ryanair also regularly 
contacts people registered in its database to inform them about promotions and special offers via e-mail.
 RESERVATIONS ON RYANAIR.COM
 Passenger airlines generally rely on travel agents (whether traditional or online) for a significant 
portion of their ticket sales and pay travel agents commissions for their services, as well as reimbursing 
them for the fees charged by reservation systems-providers. In contrast, Ryanair requires passengers to 
make reservations and purchase tickets directly through the Company. Over 99% of such reservations and 
purchases are made through the website Ryanair.com. Ryanair is therefore not reliant on travel agents. See 
"-Strategy-Taking Advantage of the Internet" above for additional information.

 Ryanair's future growth also materially depends on its ability to access suitable airports located in its targeted 
geographic markets at costs that are consistent with Ryanair's ultra-low cost strategy. Any condition that denies, 
limits, or delays Ryanair's access to airports it serves or seeks to serve in the future would constrain Ryanair's 
ability to grow. A change in the terms of Ryanair's access to these facilities or any increase in the relevant charges 
paid by Ryanair as a result of the expiration or termination of such arrangements and Ryanair's failure to 
renegotiate comparable terms or rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition 
and results of operations. In Spain, the Spanish government has announced that airport charges at the two largest 
airports, Barcelona and Madrid, will increase by over 100%, while smaller increases will take place at smaller 
Spanish airports effective from July 1, 2012. Ryanair recently cancelled routes and reduced capacity on remaining 
routes from Madrid and Barcelona, in response to the Spanish government's decision to double airport taxes at the 
two airports. Ryanair anticipates redeploying this capacity to lower cost airports in Europe.  For additional 
information see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Airport Operations-Airport Charges." See also "-The 
Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports."
 The Company's Acquisition of 29.8% of Aer Lingus and Subsequent Failure to Conclude a Complete Acquisition of 
Aer Lingus Could Expose the Company to Risk. During the 2007 fiscal year, the Company acquired 25.2% of Aer 
Lingus. The Company increased its interest to 29.3% during the 2008 fiscal year, and to 29.8% during the 2009 
fiscal year at a total aggregate cost of EUR407.2 million. Following the acquisition of its initial stake and upon the 
approval of the Company's shareholders, management proposed to effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share 
capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by the European Commission on competition 
grounds.
 In October 2007, the European Commission reached a formal decision that it would not force Ryanair to sell its 
shares in Aer Lingus. This decision has been affirmed on appeal. However, EU legislation may change in the future 
to require such a forced disposition. If eventually forced to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus, Ryanair could suffer 
significant losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer 
Lingus' shares.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -18-
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it intends 
to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected on the basis that the OFT's investigation was 
time-barred. On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus to the 
U.K. Competition Commission (the "Competition Commission"). Ryanair welcomed the OFT's decision as it believes 
that the Competition Commission should find that since Ryanair exerts no influence over Aer Lingus through its 
minority stake, it should not be forced to sell down its minority stake. However, the Competition Commission could 
order Ryanair to divest some or all of its shares in Aer Lingus, as a result of which Ryanair could suffer significant 
losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer 
Lingus'shares.
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair announced its third offer to acquire the entire share capital of Aer Lingus (the "June 19 
offer") and immediately commenced pre-notification discussions with the European Commission for the purpose of 
preparing a merger filing.  Pending the outcome of the European Commission's review of Ryanair's bid, on the 
basis of the duty of "sincere cooperation" between the EU and the Member States, and under the EU Merger 
Regulation, the Competition Commission's investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus cannot properly 
proceed. Nevertheless, Aer Lingus argued that the investigation should proceed and that Ryanair's June 19 offer 
was in breach of certain provisions of the UK Enterprise Act 2002. On July 10, 2012, the Competition Commission 
ruled that Ryanair's bid was not in breach of the UK Enterprise Act, but nevertheless decided that its investigation of 
the minority stake can proceed in parallel with the European Commission's investigation of the June 19 offer.  On 
July 13, 2012 Ryanair appealed the latter part of the Competition Commission's ruling to the UK Competition 
Appeal Tribunal. The outcome of this appeal is currently expected within a relatively short timeframe of 
approximately 3-4 weeks. Should the Competition Appeal Tribunal uphold Ryanair's appeal, the Competition 
Commission's investigation will be suspended pending the EU merger review process of the June 19 offer, 
including any subsequent appeals. Should Ryanair's appeal be rejected, the Competition Commission's 
investigation will proceed in parallel with the EU merger review process, however the Competition Commission 
could not in any event attempt to frustrate the European Commission's jurisdiction and/or decisions. For more 
information, see "Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial Information-Legal Proceedings-Matters Related to 
Investment in Aer Lingus."
 The change in the available for sale financial asset from EUR114.0 million at March 31, 2011 to EUR149.7 million 
at March 31, 2012 is comprised of a gain of EUR35.7 million, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the increase in the share price for Aer Lingus from EUR0.72 per share at March 31, 2011 to EUR0.94 per 
share at March 31, 2012. All impairment losses are required to be recognized in the income statement and are not 
subsequently reversed, while gains are recognized through other comprehensive income. Deteriorations in 
conditions in the airline industry affect the Company not only directly, but also indirectly, because the value of its 
stake in Aer Lingus fluctuates with the share price. However, as the value of the Company's stake in Aer Lingus has 
already been written down to just EUR79.7 million (the equivalent of EUR0.50 per share as of June 30, 2009), the 
potential for future write-downs of that asset is currently limited to that amount.
 Labor Relations Could Expose the Company to Risk.A variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the 
Company's historical and current level of profitability and its seasonal grounding policy may make it difficult for 
Ryanair to avoid increases to its base salary levels and employee productivity payments. Consequently, there can 
be no assurance that Ryanair's existing employee compensation arrangements may not be subject to change or 
modification at any time. The Company agreed to provide a company-wide pay increase of up to 2% on basic pay 
for certain categories of employees, effective April 1, 2011.  The Company paid increases in line with agreements 
previously negotiated with employee representative committees that provided for pay increases (on average 2%) 
effective April 1, 2012.  Those employees not covered by an existing agreement have had their pay frozen for a 
period of one year, until compensation is reviewed again in April 2013. These steps may lead to a deterioration in 
labor relations in the Company and could impact the Company's business or results of operations. The Company 
also operates in certain jurisdictions with above average payroll taxes and employee-related social insurance costs, 
which could have an impact on the availability and cost of employees in these jurisdictions. Ryanair crew in 
continental Europe operate on Irish contracts of employment on the basis that those crew work on Irish Territory, 
(i.e. on board Irish Registered Aircraft). A number of challenges have been initiated by government agencies in a 
number of countries to the applicability of Irish labor law to these contracts, and if Ryanair were forced to concede 
that Irish jurisdiction did not apply to those crew who operate from continental Europe then it could lead to 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -18-
increased salary, social insurance and pension costs and a potential loss of flexibility. In relation to social insurance 
costs, the European Parliament has approved amendments to Regulation (EC) 883/2004 which will impose 
substantial social insurance contribution increases for both the Company and the individual employees. This 
change came into effect from late June 2012. While this change to social insurance contributions relates primarily to 
new employees, its effect in the long term may materially increase Company social insurance contributions and 
could affect the Company's decision to operate from those high cost locations, resulting in redundancies and a 
consequent deterioration in labor relations.  For additional details see - "Change in EU regulations in relations to 
Employers and Employee Social Insurance could Increase costs".
 Ryanair currently conducts collective bargaining negotiations with groups of employees, including its pilots, 
regarding pay, work practices, and conditions of employment, through collective-bargaining units called "Employee 
Representation Committees." In the U.K., BALPA unsuccessfully sought to represent Ryanair's U.K.-based pilots in 
their negotiations with the Company in 2001, at which time an overwhelming majority of those polled rejected 
BALPA's claim to represent them. On June 19, 2009, BALPA (the U.K. pilots union) made a request for voluntary 
recognition under applicable U.K. legislation, which Ryanair rejected. BALPA had the option of applying to the 
U.K.'s Central Arbitration Committee ("CAC") to organize a vote on union recognition by Ryanair's pilots in relevant 
bargaining units, as determined by the CAC, but BALPA decided not to proceed with an application at that time. 
The option to apply for a ballot remains open to BALPA and if it were to seek and be successful in such a ballot, it 
would be able to represent the U.K. pilots in negotiations over salaries and working conditions. For additional 
details, see "Item 6.

 Operating profit. As a result of the factors outlined above, operating profit increased 2.5% on a per-ASM basis in 
the 2011 fiscal year, and also increased in absolute terms, from EUR402.1 million in the 2010 fiscal year to 
EUR488.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year.
 Finance income. Ryanair's interest and similar income increased 15.8%, from EUR23.5 million in the 2010 fiscal 
year to EUR27.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year reflecting the impact of higher market interest rates which was 
partially offset by the Company's policy of continuing to place its deposits with highly rated and guaranteed financial 
institutions which typically provide a lower yield.
 Finance expense. Ryanair's interest and similar charges increased 30.2%, from EUR72.1 million in the 2010 fiscal 
year to EUR93.9 million in the 2011 fiscal year, primarily due to the drawdown of debt related to the acquisition of 
additional Boeing 737-800 aircraft. These costs are expected to increase as Ryanair further expands its fleet.
 Foreign exchange losses/gains.Ryanair recorded foreign exchange losses of EUR0.6 million in the 2011 fiscal 
year, as compared with foreign exchange losses of EUR1.0 million in the 2010 fiscal year, with the different result 
being primarily due to the strengthening of the U.K. pound sterling and U.S. dollar against the euro during the 2011 
fiscal year.
 Taxation. The effective tax rate for the 2011 fiscal year was 11.0%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 10.5% 
in the 2010 fiscal year. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory rate of Irish corporation tax of 12.5%. Ryanair 
recorded an income tax provision of EUR46.3 million in the 2011 fiscal year, compared with a tax provision of 
EUR35.7 million in the 2010 fiscal year, with the increase primarily reflecting higher pre-tax profits. The 
determination regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset was based on future income forecasts, which 
demonstrated that it was more likely than not that future profits would be available in order to utilize the deferred tax 
asset. A deferred tax asset's recoverability is not dependent on material improvements over historical levels of pre-
tax income, material changes in the present relationship between income reported for financial and tax purposes, or 
material asset sales or other non-routine transactions.
 SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS
 The Company's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management expects 
these variations to continue. Among the factors causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -40-
general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Ryanair typically records higher revenues and 
income in the first half of each fiscal year ended March 31 than the second half of such year.
 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 Please see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for information on recently issued 
accounting standards that are material to the Company.
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 Liquidity. The Company finances its working capital requirements through a combination of cash generated from 
operations and bank loans for the acquisition of aircraft. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Company-The Company Will Incur Significant Costs Acquiring New Aircraft" for more information about risks 
relating to liquidity and capital resources. The Company had cash and liquid resources at March 31, 2012 and 2011 
of EUR3,515.6 million and EUR2,940.6 million, respectively. The increase at March 31, 2012 primarily reflects cash 
generated from operating activities of EUR1,020.3 million offset in part by the cash used to fund the purchase of 
property, plant, and equipment - primarily 14 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and the purchase of 36.5 million Ordinary 
Shares via a share buy-back costing EUR124.6 million.  During the 2012 fiscal year, the Company funded its 
EUR317.6 million in purchases of property, plant, and equipment out of EUR292.3 million in loans. Cash and liquid 
resources included EUR35.1 million and EUR42.9 million in "restricted cash" held on deposit as collateral for certain 
derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company with respect to its aircraft financing obligations and 
other banking arrangements at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. See "Item 8. Financial Information[3/4]Other 
Financial Information[3/4]Legal Proceedings."
 The Company's net cash inflows from operating activities in the 2012 and 2011 fiscal years amounted to 
EUR1,020.3 million and EUR786.3 million, respectively. During the last two fiscal years, Ryanair's primary cash 
requirements have been for operating expenses, additional aircraft, including advance payments in respect of new 
Boeing 737-800s and related flight equipment, payments on related indebtedness and payments of corporation tax, 
as well as share buy-backs of EUR124.6 million and the payment of a EUR500.0 million special dividend to 
shareholders. Cash generated from operations has been the principal source for these cash requirements, 
supplemented primarily by aircraft-related bank loans.
 The Company's net cash used in investing activities in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 totaled EUR185.4 million and 
EUR474.0 million, respectively, primarily reflecting the Company's capital expenditures, and investment of cash 
with maturities of greater than three months, as described in more detail below.
 The Company's net cash provided by financing activities totaled EUR238.1 million in the 2011 fiscal year, largely 
reflecting the receipt of proceeds from long-term borrowings of EUR991.4 million in fiscal year 2011, offset in part 
by repayments of long-term borrowings of EUR280.7 million. There was a net cash outflow from financing activities 
of EUR154.9 million in fiscal year 2012.  This was due to the receipt of proceeds from long term borrowings of 
EUR292.3 million being more than offset by repayments of long-term borrowings of EUR329.7 million and the 
expenditure of EUR124.6 million under the share buy-back program.
 Capital Expenditures. The Company's net cash outflows for capital expenditures in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 
were EUR290.4 million and EUR897.2 million, respectively. Ryanair has funded a significant portion of its 
acquisition of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and related equipment through borrowings under facilities provided by 
international financial institutions on the basis of guarantees issued by Ex-Im Bank. At March 31, 2012, Ryanair had 
a fleet of 294 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, the majority of which (199 aircraft) were funded by Ex-Im Bank-guaranteed 
financing. Other sources of on-balance-sheet aircraft financing utilized by Ryanair are Japanese Operating Leases 
with Call Options ("JOLCOs"), which are treated as finance leases (30 of the aircraft in the fleet as of March 31, 
2012) and commercial debt financing (6 of the aircraft in the fleet as of March 31, 2012). Of Ryanair's total fleet of 
294 aircraft there were 59 Boeing 737-800 aircraft in Ryanair's fleet at March 31, 2012 which were financed through 
operating lease arrangements. Of the 25 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft which Ryanair took delivery of between April 
1, 2011 and March 31, 2012, 11 were financed through sale-and-leaseback financings and the remainder through 
Ex-Im Bank guaranteed-financing. Ryanair has generally been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to 
meet its non-aircraft acquisition-related working capital requirements. Management believes that the working capital 
available to the Company is sufficient for its present requirements and will be sufficient to meet its anticipated 
requirements for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the 2013 fiscal year.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -40-
 The table on the following page summarizes the delivery schedule for the Boeing 737-800 aircraft Ryanair has 
purchased, or is required to purchase, under its past and current contracts with Boeing, including through the 
exercise of purchase options. These Boeing 737-800s are identical in all significant respects, having 189 seats and 
the same cockpit and engine configuration. The table also provides details of the "Basic Price" (equivalent to a 
standard list price for an aircraft of this type) for each of these aircraft. The Basic Price for each of the firm-order 
aircraft to be delivered pursuant to the 2005 Boeing contract, as well as for each of the firm-order aircraft that 
remained to be delivered and purchase options outstanding under the prior contracts at January 1, 2005, will be 
increased by (a) an estimated $900,000 per aircraft for certain "buyer furnished" equipment the Company has 
asked Boeing to purchase and install on each of the aircraft, and (b) an "Escalation Factor" designed to increase 
the Basic Price of any individual aircraft to reflect increases in the published U.S. Employment Cost and Producer 
Price indices from the time the Basic Price is set through the time six months prior to the delivery of such aircraft. 
The Basic Price is also subject to decrease to take into account certain concessions granted to the Company by 
Boeing pursuant to the terms of the contracts. These concessions take the form of credit memoranda, which the 
Company may apply towards the purchase of goods and services from Boeing or towards certain payments in 
respect of the purchase of the aircraft. These credit memoranda are generally incorporated into Boeing's final 
aircraft invoices and thus reduce the amount paid by Ryanair for aircraft. Boeing and CFM International S.A. (the 
manufacturer of the CFM56-7B engines that power the Boeing 737-800 aircraft) have also agreed to give the 
Company certain allowances for promotional and other activities, as well as provide other goods and services to the 
Company on concessionary terms. As a result of credit memoranda received from Boeing, the effective price of 
each aircraft purchased in the past has been, and the effective prices of aircraft to be delivered in the future are 
expected to be, significantly below the unadjusted Basic Prices in the table on the following page.

Body
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR114.0 million at March 31, 2011 to 
EUR149.7 million at March 31, 2012 is comprised of a gain of EUR35.7 million, recognised through other 
comprehensive income, reflecting the increase in the share price of Aer Lingus from EUR0.72 per share at 
March 31, 2011 to EUR0.94 per share at March 31, 2012. All impairment losses are required to be recognised 
in the income statement and are not subsequently reversed, while gains are recognised through other 
comprehensive income.  The investment in Aer Lingus has in prior periods been impaired to EUR0.50 per 
share.  In fiscal year 2010, the Company recorded an impairment charge of EUR13.5 million on the income 
statement relating to its Aer Lingus shareholding.
 This investment is classified as available-for-sale, rather than as an investment in an associate, 
because the Company does not have the power to exercise any influence over the entity. The Company's 
determination that it does not have any influence over Aer Lingus through its minority shareholding has 
been based on the following factors, in particular:
 (i)             Ryanair does not have any representation on the Aer Lingus Board of Directors, nor does 
it have a right to appoint a director;
 (ii)           Ryanair does not participate in Aer Lingus' policy-making decisions, nor does it have a 
right to participate in such policy-making decisions;
 (iii)          There are no material transactions between Ryanair and Aer Lingus, there is no interchange 
of personnel between the two companies and there is no sharing of technical information between the 
companies;
 (iv)          Aer Lingus and its significant shareholder (the Irish government: 25.1%) have openly 
opposed Ryanair's investment or participation in the company;
 (v)           In August 2007, September 2007 and November/December 2011, Aer Lingus refused Ryanair's 
attempt to assert its statutory right to requisition a general meeting (a legal right of any 10% 
shareholder under Irish law).
 (vi)          On April 15, 2011, the High Court in Dublin ruled that Aer Lingus was not obliged to accede 
to Ryanair's request that two additional resolutions (on the payment of a dividend and on payments to 
pension schemes) be put to vote at Aer Lingus' annual general meeting; and
 (vii)         The European Commission has formally found that Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus does 
not grant Ryanair "de jure or de facto control of Aer Lingus" and that "Ryanair's rights as a minority 
shareholder...are associated exclusively to rights related to the protection of minority shareholders" 
(Commission Decision Case No. COMP/M.4439 dated October 11, 2007). The European Commission's finding has 
been confirmed by the European Union's General Court which issued a decision on July 6, 2010 that the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -69-
European Commission was justified to use the required legal and factual standard in its refusal to order 
Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding in Aer Lingus and that, as part of that decision, Ryanair's 
shareholding did not confer control of Aer Lingus (Judgment of the General Court (Third Chamber) Case No. 
T-411/07 dated July 6, 2010).
 On December 1, 2008 Ryanair made a second offer to acquire 70.2% of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus plc 
that it does not already own. However, the Company was unable to secure the shareholders' support and 
accordingly on January 28, 2009 withdrew its offer for Aer Lingus.
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it 
intends to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected to this investigation on 
the basis that the OFT's investigation became time-barred within four months from the European 
Commission's June 2007 decision to prohibit Ryanair's takeover of Aer Lingus. The OFT agreed in October 
2010 to suspend its investigation pending the outcome of Ryanair's appeal against the OFT's investigation.
 On July 28, 2011, the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that the OFT was not time barred when it 
attempted in September 2010 to open an investigation into Ryanair's 2006 acquisition of a minority non-
controlling stake in Aer Lingus.  Ryanair appealed the Competition Appeal Tribunal's decision.  On 
November 24, 2011, the UK Court of Appeal ordered a stay of the OFT's investigation pending the Courts 
review of whether the OFT's investigation was time barred.  On May 22, 2012, the Court of Appeal found 
that the OFT was not time barred to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus in September 2010.  
Ryanair subsequently sought permission to appeal that ruling to the UK Supreme Court, but permission was 
refused. On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus to 
the UK Competition Commission. Ryanair welcomed the decision by the OFT to refer the case to the 
Competition Commission and Ryanair anticipates that the Competition Commission will agree with the 
decision of the European Commission in 2007 that since Ryanair has neither "de factor or de jure control" 
in Aer Lingus, that it should not be forced to sell down its minority stake.  The Competition Commission 
could order Ryanair to divest some or all of its shares in Aer Lingus, as a result of which Ryanair could 
suffer significant losses due to the negative impact on attainable prices of the forced sale of such a 
significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares.
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair made a third all cash offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus 
it did not own at a price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share.
 5              Derivative financial instruments
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has responsibility for monitoring the treasury policies and 
objectives of the Company, which include controls over the procedures used to manage the main financial 
risks arising from the Company's operations. Such risks comprise commodity price, foreign exchange and 
interest rate risks. The Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks. 
These instruments include borrowings, cash deposits and derivatives (principally jet fuel derivatives, 
interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts). It is the 
Company's policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments takes place.
 The Company's historical fuel risk management policy has been to hedge between 70% and 90% of the 
forecast rolling annual volumes required to ensure that the future cost per gallon of fuel is locked in. 
This policy was adopted to prevent the Company being exposed, in the short term, to adverse movements in 
global jet fuel prices. However, when deemed to be in the best interests of the Company, it may deviate 
from this policy. At March 31, 2012, the Company had hedged approximately 90% of its estimated fuel 
exposure for the year ending March 31, 2013. At March 31, 2011, the Company had hedged approximately 77% 
of its estimated fuel exposure for the year ending March 31, 2012. At March 31, 2010, the Company had 
hedged approximately 85% of its estimated fuel exposure for the year ending March 31, 2011.
 Foreign currency risk in relation to the Company's trading operations largely arises in relation to non-
euro currencies. These currencies are primarily U.K. pounds sterling and the U.S. dollar. The Company 
manages this risk by matching pounds sterling revenues against pounds sterling costs. Surplus pounds 
sterling revenues are sometimes used to fund forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge U.S. dollar 
currency exposures that arise in relation to fuel, maintenance, aviation insurance, and capital 
expenditure costs and excess pounds sterling are converted into euro. Additionally, the Company swaps euro 
for U.S. dollars using forward currency contracts to cover any expected dollar outflows for these costs. 
From time to time, the Company also swaps euro for U.K. pounds sterling using forward currency contracts 
to hedge expected future surplus pounds sterling. From time to time the Company also enters into cross-
currency interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates in 
respect of US dollar denominated borrowings.
 The Company's objective for interest rate risk management is to reduce interest-rate risk through a 
combination of financial instruments, which lock in interest rates on debt and by matching a proportion of 
floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities. In addition, the Company aims to achieve the best 
available return on investments of surplus cash - subject to credit risk and liquidity constraints. Credit 
risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty based on 
third-party market-based ratings. In line with the above interest rate risk management strategy, the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -69-
Company has entered into a series of interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates 
for certain floating rate financial arrangements and certain other obligations. The Company has also 
entered into floating rate financing for certain aircraft, which is matched with floating rate deposits. 
Additionally, certain cash deposits have been set aside as collateral for the counterparty's exposure to 
risk of fluctuations on certain derivative and other financing arrangements with Ryanair (restricted 
cash). At March 31, 2012, such restricted cash amounted to EUR35.1 million (2011: EUR42.9 million; 2010: 
EUR67.8 million). Additional numerical information on these swaps and on other derivatives held by the 
Company is set out below and in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
 The Company utilises a range of derivatives designed to mitigate these risks. All of the above 
derivatives have been accounted for at fair value in the Company's balance sheet and have been utilised to 
hedge against these particular risks arising in the normal course of the Company's business. All have been 
designated as hedging derivatives for the purposes of IAS 39 and are fully set out below.

 In deciding which Affected Shares are to be selected as Restricted Shares, the directors can take into account 
which Affected Shares have given rise to the necessity to take action. Subject to that they will, insofar as 
practicable, firstly view as Restricted Shares those Affected Shares in respect of which no declaration as to whether 
or not such shares are Affected Shares has been made by the holder thereof and where information which has 
been requested by the directors in accordance with the Articles has not been provided within specified time periods 
and, secondly, have regard to the chronological order in which details of Affected Shares have been entered in the 
Separate Register and, accordingly, treat the most recently registered Affected Shares as Restricted Shares to the 
extent necessary. Transfers of Affected Shares to Affiliates (as that expression is defined in the Articles) will not 
affect the chronological order of entry in the Separate Register for this purpose. The directors do however have the 
discretion to apply another basis of selection if, in their sole opinion, that would be more equitable. Where the 
directors have resolved to treat Affected Shares held by any particular stockholder or stockholders as Restricted 
Shares (i) because such Affected Shares have given rise to the need to take such action or (ii) because of a change 
of law or a requirement or direction of a regulatory authority necessitating such action (see above), such powers 
may be exercised irrespective of the date upon which such Affected Shares were entered in the Separate Register.
 After having initially resolved to set the maximum level at 49.0%, the directors increased the maximum level to 
49.9% on May 26, 1999, after the number of Affected Shares exceeded the initial limit. This maximum level could 
be reduced if it becomes necessary for the directors to exercise these powers in the circumstances described 
above. The decision to make any such reduction or to change the Permitted Maximum from time to time will be 
published in at least one national newspaper in Ireland and in any country in which the Ordinary Shares or ADRs 
are listed. The relevant notice will specify the provisions of the Articles that apply to Restricted Shares and the 
name of the person or persons who will answer queries relating to Restricted Shares on behalf of Ryanair Holdings. 
The directors shall publish information as to the number of shares held by EU nationals annually.
 In an effort to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, on June 26, 2001, Ryanair 
Holdings instructed the Depositary to suspend the issuance of new ADSs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary 
Shares until further notice to its shareholders. Holders of Ordinary Shares cannot convert their Ordinary Shares into 
ADRs during such suspension, and there can be no assurance that the suspension will ever be lifted.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -54-
 As a further measure to increase the percentage of Ordinary Shares held by EU nationals, on February 7, 2002, 
the Company issued a notice to shareholders to the effect that any purchase of Ordinary Shares by a non-EU 
national after such date will immediately result in the issue of a Restricted Share Notice to such non-EU national 
Purchaser. The Restricted Share Notice compels the non-EU national purchaser to sell the Affected Shares to an 
EU national within 21 days of the date of issuance. In the event that any such non-EU national shareholder does 
not sell its Ordinary Shares to an EU national within the specified time period, the Company can then take legal 
action to compel such a sale. As a result, non-EU nationals are effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary Shares 
for as long as these restrictions remain in place. There can be no assurance that these restrictions will ever be 
lifted.
 As an additional measure, to ensure the percentage of shares held by EU nationals remains at least 50.1%, at the 
extraordinary general meeting held on April 19, 2012, the Company obtained a new repurchase authority which will 
enable the repurchase of ADRs for up to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company traded on the NASDAQ.
 Concerns about the foreign ownership restrictions described above could result in the exclusion of Ryanair from 
certain stock tracking indices. Any such exclusion may adversely affect the market price of the Ordinary Shares and 
ADRs. See also "Item 3. Risk Factors--Risks Related to Ownership of the Company's Shares or ADRs-EU Rules 
Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals and the 
Company has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals" above.
 As of June 30, 2012, EU nationals owned at least 54.2% of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares (assuming 
conversion of all outstanding ADRs into Ordinary Shares). Ryanair continuously monitors the ownership status of its 
Ordinary Shares, which changes on a daily basis.
 TAXATION
 Irish Tax Considerations
 The following is a discussion of certain Irish tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of 
Ordinary Shares or ADSs. This discussion is based upon tax laws and practice of Ireland at the date of this 
document, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Particular rules may apply to certain 
classes of taxpayers (such as dealers in securities) and this discussion does not purport to deal with the tax 
consequences of purchase, ownership or disposition of the relevant securities for all categories of investors.
 The discussion is intended only as a general guide based on current Irish law and practice and is not intended to 
be, nor should it be considered to be, legal or tax advice to any particular investor or stockholder. Accordingly, 
current stockholders or potential investors should satisfy themselves as to the overall tax consequences by 
consulting their own tax advisers.
 Dividends. If Ryanair Holdings pays dividends or makes other relevant distributions, the following is relevant:
 Withholding Tax. Unless exempted, a withholding at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%) will apply to 
dividends or other relevant distributions paid by an Irish resident company. The withholding tax requirement will not 
apply to distributions paid to certain categories of Irish resident stockholders or to distributions paid to certain 
categories of non-resident stockholders.
 The following Irish resident stockholders are exempt from withholding if they make to the Company, in advance of 
payment of any relevant distribution, an appropriate declaration of entitlement to exemption:
 Irish resident companies;
 Pension schemes approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners ("Irish Revenue");
 Qualifying fund managers or qualifying savings managers;
 Personal Retirement Savings Account ("PRSA") administrators who receive the relevant distribution as income 
arising in respect of PRSA assets;
 Qualifying employee share ownership trusts;
 Collective investment undertakings;
 Tax-exempt charities;
 Designated brokers receiving the distribution for special portfolio investment accounts;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -54-
 Any person who is entitled to exemption from income tax under Schedule F on dividends in respect of an 
investment in whole or in part of payments received in respect of a civil action or from the Personal Injuries 
Assessment Board for damages in respect of mental or physical infirmity;
 Certain qualifying trusts established for the benefit of an incapacitated individual and/or persons in receipt of 
income from such a qualifying trust;
 Any person entitled to exemption to income tax under Schedule F by virtue of Section 192(2) Taxes Consolidation 
Act ("TCA") 1997;
 Unit trusts to which Section 731(5)(a) TCA 1997 applies; and
 Certain Irish Revenue-approved amateur and athletic sport bodies.
 The following non-resident stockholders are exempt from withholding if they make to the Company, in advance of 
payment of any dividend, an appropriate declaration of entitlement to exemption:
 Persons (other than a company) who (i) are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and (ii) are resident 
for tax purposes in (a) a country which has signed a tax treaty with Ireland (a "tax treaty country") or (b) an EU 
member state other than Ireland;
 Companies not resident in Ireland which are resident in an EU member state or a tax treaty country, by virtue of the 
law of an EU member state or a tax treaty country and are not controlled, directly or indirectly, by Irish residents;
 Companies not resident in Ireland which are directly or indirectly controlled by a person or persons who are, by 
virtue of the law of a tax treaty country or an EU member state, resident for tax purposes in a tax treaty country or 
an EU member state other than Ireland and which are not controlled directly or indirectly by persons who are not 
resident for tax purposes in a tax treaty country or EU member state;
 Companies not resident in Ireland the principal class of shares of which is substantially and regularly traded on a 
recognized stock exchange in a tax treaty country or an EU member state including Ireland or on an approved stock 
exchange; or
 Companies not resident in Ireland that are 75% subsidiaries of a single company, or are wholly-owned by two or 
more companies, in either case the principal classes of shares of which is or are substantially and regularly traded 
on a recognized stock exchange in a tax treaty country or an EU member state including Ireland or on an approved 
stock exchange.

 --   a risk management programme in place throughout the Company whereby executive management reviews and 
monitors the controls in place, both financial and non financial, to manage the risks facing the business.
 On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Company's system of 
risk management and internal control for the year ended March 31, 2012 and has reported thereon to the 
Board.
 The Board has delegated to executive management the planning and implementation of the systems of 
internal control within an established framework which applies throughout the Company.
 Takeover Bids Directive
 Information regarding rights and obligations attached to shares are set forth in Note 15 on pages 169 to 
171 of the consolidated financial statements.
 Shares in the Ryanair employee share schemes carry no control rights and shares are only issued (and gain 
voting rights) when options are exercised by employees.
 Ryanair's Articles of Association do not contain any restrictions on voting rights. However, there are 
provisions in the Articles which allow the directors to (amongst other things) suspend the voting rights 
of a share if the Board believes the number of non-qualifying nationals holding shares in Ryanair would 
put it in breach of the Air Navigation Acts and licences and permits which allow it to operate. This is 
not an absolute restriction and can only occur if the Board designates a number of shares to be so 
restricted.
 Ryanair has not received any notifications from shareholders (as shareholders are obliged to do) 
regarding any agreements between shareholders which might result in restrictions on the transfer of 
shares.
 Details of the rules concerning the removal and appointment of the directors are set out above as part of 
this Directors' Report. There are no specific rules regarding the amendment of the Company's Articles of 
Association.
 Details of the Company's share buy-back programme are set forth on page 109 of the Annual Report. The 
shareholders approved the power of the Company to buy back shares at the 2006 AGM and at subsequent AGM's.
 None of the significant agreements to which the Company is party to, contain change of control 
provisions. As referred to above in this Director's Report, Mr. Michael O'Leary's employment agreement 
does not contain provisions providing for compensation on his termination.
 Going Concern
 After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -9-
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The directors' responsibility for 
preparing the financial statements is explained on page 28 and the reporting responsibilities of the 
auditors are set out in their report on page 30.
 Compliance Statement
 Ryanair has complied, throughout the year ended March 31, 2012, with the provisions set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the requirements set out in the Irish Corporate Governance Annex except as 
outlined below. The Group has not complied with the following provisions of the 2010 Code, but continues 
to review these situations on an ongoing basis:
 --    Non-executive directors participate in the Company's share option plans. The 2010 Code requires 
that, if exceptionally, share options are granted to non-executive directors that shareholder approval 
should be sought in advance and any shares acquired by exercise of the options should be held until at 
least one year after the non-executive director leaves the board. In accordance with the 2010 Code, the 
Company sought and received shareholder approval to make certain stock option grants to its non-executive 
directors and as described above, the Board believes the quantum of options granted to non-executive 
directors is not so significant to impair their independence.
 --    Certain non-executive directors, namely Mr. David Bonderman, Mr. James Osborne, Mr. Kyran 
McLaughlin, Mr. Michael Horgan, Mr. Klaus Kirchberger and Mr. Paolo Pietrogrande, have each served more 
than nine years on the Board without being offered for annual re-election. As described further above, 
given the other significant commercial and professional commitments of these non-executive directors, and 
taking into account that their independence is considered annually by the Board, the Board does not 
consider their independence to be impaired in this regard.
 On behalf of the Board
 Mr. David Bonderman                        Mr. Michael O' Leary

 July 27, 2012
 REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE ON DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
 The Remuneration Committee
 Details of the Remuneration Committee are set out within the Corporate Governance Statement on page 21 of 
the Annual Report.
 The role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in its written terms of 
reference, which are available on the Company's website www.ryanair.com.
 All members of the Remuneration Committee have access to the advice of the Chief Executive and may, in 
the furtherance of their duties, obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense.
 Remuneration Policy
 The remuneration policy of the Company is to ensure that the executive director and the senior key 
management team are rewarded competitively, having regard to the comparative marketplace in Ireland and 
the United Kingdom, in order to ensure that they are properly motivated to perform in the best interests 
of the shareholders. Details of the total remuneration paid to senior key management (defined as the 
executive team reporting to the Board of Directors) are set out in Note 27 of the consolidated Financial 
Statements.
 Non-Executive Directors
 Details of the remuneration paid to non- executive directors are set out in Note 19(b) to the 
consolidated Financial Statements.
 Directors can only be appointed following selection by the Nomination Committee and approval by the Board 
and must be elected by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment. 
Ryanair's Articles of Association require that all directors retire after a fixed period not exceeding 
three years. Directors can then offer themselves for re-election at the Company's Annual General Meeting.
 None of the non-executive Directors hold a service agreement with the Company that provides for benefits 
upon termination.
 Executive Director
 The Chief Executive of the Company is the only executive director on the Board. Details of the 
remuneration paid to the Chief Executive are set out in Note 19(a) to the consolidated Financial 
Statements.
 The Company entered into an employment agreement with the Chief Executive on July 1, 2002 for a one year 
period to June 30, 2003. Thereafter, the agreement continues for successive annual periods but may be 
terminated with 12 months notice by either party. This employment agreement does not contain provisions 
providing for compensation on its termination.
 Performance Related Bonuses
 The Chief Executive and the key management team of the Company are eligible for a performance bonus and 
other bonuses dependent upon the achievement of certain financial targets.
 Share Options
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -9-
 Details of the share options granted to executive and non-executive directors are set forth in Note 19(d) 
to the consolidated Financial Statements.
 Details of employee share option plans are set forth in Note 15(c) to the consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Financial Statements.
 Directors Shareholdings

Company are set forth in Note 19(d) to the consolidated Financial Statements.
 Statement of Directors' Responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
 The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the consolidated and Company financial 
statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
 Company law requires the directors to prepare consolidated and Company financial statements for each 
financial year.  Under that law, the directors are required to prepare the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements the directors have also elected to comply with IFRSs as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
 The consolidated and Company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU, to 
present fairly the financial position of the Group and the Company and the performance of the Group.  The 
Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012 provide in relation to such financial statements that references in the 
relevant part of these Acts to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their 
achieving a fair presentation.
 In preparing each of the consolidated and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 --      select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 --      make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 --      state that the financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in 
accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012 and IFRSs as issued by the IASB; and
 --      prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group and the Company will continue in business.

grants are subject to approval by the Remuneration Committee. These are exercisable at a price equal to 
the market price of the ordinary shares at the time options are granted. The key terms of these option 
plans include the requirement that certain employees remain in employment with the Company for a specified 
period of time.  See note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for more details.

 Ryanair has installed an Operational Flight Data Monitoring (OFDM) system on each of its Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 
which automatically provides a confidential report on variations from normal operating limitations detected during 
the course of each flight. The purpose of this system is to monitor operational trends and inform management of 
any instance of an operational limit being exceeded. By analyzing these reports, management is able to identify 
undesirable trends and potential areas of risk, so as to take steps to rectify such deviations, thereby ensuring 
adherence to Ryanair's flight safety standards.
 In November 2008, a Ryanair aircraft suffered a multiple bird strike during its final approach to Rome (Ciampino) 
airport. This incident caused substantial damage to the aircraft, which resulted in an insurance claim being filed in 
respect of this aircraft. The damage that it suffered was such that the aircraft was not repaired. It is scheduled as a 
"disposal" in the table on page 91, although Ryanair has retained ownership of it for certain parts and for training 
purposes.
 AIRPORT OPERATIONS
 Airport Handling Services
 Ryanair provides its own aircraft and passenger handling and ticketing services at Dublin Airport. Third parties 
provide these services to Ryanair at most other airports it serves. Servisair plc provides Ryanair's ticketing, 
passenger and aircraft handling, and ground handling services at many of these airports in Ireland and the U.K. 
(excluding London (Stansted) Airport where these services are provided primarily by Swissport Ltd.), while similar 
services in continental Europe are generally provided by the local airport authorities, either directly or through sub-
contractors. Management attempts to obtain competitive rates for such services by negotiating multi-year contracts 
at fixed prices. These contracts are generally scheduled to expire in one to five years, unless renewed, and certain 
of them may be terminated by either party before their expiry upon prior notice. Ryanair will need to enter into 
similar agreements in any new markets it may enter. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Company-The Company Is Dependent on External Service Providers."
 During 2009, Ryanair introduced Internet check-in for all passengers and also introduced kiosks at certain airports 
for the provision of other services. The Company has these kiosks in operation at Dublin, London (Stansted), 
London (Gatwick), Frankfurt (Hahn), and many of its other bases. The introduction of Internet check-in and kiosks 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -28-
combined with the reduction in the number of bags carried by passengers are expected to enable Ryanair to 
achieve further reductions in airport handling costs.
 Airport Charges
 As with other airlines, Ryanair must pay airport charges each time it lands and accesses facilities at the airports it 
serves. Depending on the policy of the individual airport, such charges can include landing fees, passenger loading 
fees, security fees and parking fees. Ryanair attempts to negotiate discounted fees by delivering annual increases 
in passenger traffic, and opts, when practicable, for less expensive facilities, such as less convenient gates and the 
use of outdoor boarding stairs rather than more expensive jetways. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that 
the airports Ryanair uses will not impose higher airport charges in the future and that any such increases would not 
adversely affect the Company's operations.
 As a result of rising airport charges and the introduction of an Air Travel Tax of EUR10 on passengers departing 
from Irish airports on routes longer than 300 kilometers from Dublin Airport (EUR2 on shorter routes), Ryanair 
reduced its fleet at Dublin airport to 13 during winter 2010 (down from 22 in summer 2008 and 20 in winter 2008). 
The introduction of the aforementioned EUR10 tax has likely had a negative impact on the number of passengers 
traveling to and from Ireland. The Dublin Airport Authority ("DAA") has reported that passenger volumes declined by 
25% from 30 million in 2007 to 22 million in 2011. Ryanair believes that this is partly reflective of the negative 
impact of the tax on Irish travel. Ryanair has called for the elimination of the tax to stimulate tourism during the 
recession. The Company has cited the example of the Dutch government, which withdrew its travel tax with effect 
from July 1, 2009. The Dutch travel tax had ranged from EUR11 for short-haul flights to EUR45 for long-haul flights 
and had resulted in a significant decline in passenger volumes at Schiphol Airport, Holland's main airport, according 
to data published by the airport. Ryanair also complained to the European Commission about the unlawful 
differentiation in the level of the Irish Air Travel tax between routes within the EU. From April 2011 a single rate 
(EUR3) of the Air Travel Tax has been introduced on all routes. In May 2011 the Irish Government announced that 
it would abolish the Air Travel Tax, although no details were provided as to when this decision would be 
implemented. No assurance can be given that the tax will be abolished or indeed that a higher rate of tax will not be 
applied in the future, which could have a negative impact on demand for air travel. In June 2011, Ryanair proposed 
to the Irish Government that it would deliver an incremental 5 million passengers per annum over a five year period 
in return for reduced airport charges and the abolition of the EUR3 air travel tax. Despite the fact that this offer was 
renewed in 2012, as of July 20, 2012, the Company has not yet received a positive response to this proposal.
 Both the Belgian and Greek governments planned to introduce similar taxes; however, they have now cancelled 
plans to introduce these taxes. The German government introduced an EUR8 passenger tax on January 1, 2011 for 
all departing domestic or short-haul passengers and a passenger tax of EUR25 for all departing passengers on 
flights bound for southern Europe and northern Africa. The EUR8 tax was reduced to EUR7.50 in January 2012. In 
addition, the Austrian government introduced an ecological air travel levy of EUR8 effective January 1, 2011.
 In March 2007, the discount arrangement formerly in place at London (Stansted) airport terminated, subjecting 
Ryanair to an average increase in charges of approximately 100%. The increase in these charges, which was 
passed on in the form of higher ticket prices, had a negative impact on yields and passenger volumes in the winter, 
resulting in Ryanair's decision to ground seven aircraft. Ryanair responded to the increases by filing complaints with 
the U.K. Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") and the Competition Commission, calling for the break-up of the British 
Airports Authority plc ("BAA") monopoly and the introduction of competition in the London airports market. The OFT 
referred the matter to the Competition Commission, whose preliminary findings were released in April 2008. The 
Competition Commission found that the common ownership by BAA of the three main airports in London affects 
competition and that a "light touch" approach to regulating BAA by the Civil Aviation Authority was adversely 
impacting competition. The Competition Commission subsequently in March 2009, ordered the break-up of BAA, a 
reorganization that will require the sale of both London (Gatwick) and London (Stansted) airports and either 
Glasgow or Edinburgh Airport in Scotland. In October 2009, London (Gatwick) was sold to Global Infrastructure 
Partners for GBP1.5 billion. In February 2010, this decision by the Competition Commission was quashed by the 
UK Competition Appeal Tribunal ("Competition Appeal Tribunal") on the basis of an alleged appearance of bias on 
the part of one of the six members of the Competition Commission panel. However, in October 2010, following 
appeals from the Competition Commission and Ryanair, the Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeals 
Tribunal ruling and reinstated the Competition Commission's March 2009 decision to order the break-up of the BAA 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -28-
airport monopoly. In February 2011 BAA's request for permission to appeal the Court of Appeal ruling was refused 
by the Supreme Court, putting an end to this appeal process. The Competition Commission meanwhile initiated a 
consultation on the appropriateness of the March 2009 remedies given the passage of time. In July 2011 the 
Competition Commission confirmed its March 2011 provisional decision on "possible material changes of 
circumstances." It found that no material changes of circumstances (that would necessitate a change in the 
remedies package) have occurred since the March 2009 decision requiring the BAA to sell Gatwick, Stansted and 
one of Glasgow or Edinburgh airports, and that consequently the BAA should proceed to dispose of Stansted and 
one of the Scottish airports.  The BAA appealed this decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and lost on 
February 1, 2012. The BAA then brought a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, which they also lost on July 26, 
2012. The BAA then announced that they intend to appeal this decision to the UK Supreme Court in 2012. While 
these appeals were ongoing, the BAA proceeded to sell Edinburgh airport in April 2012. Ryanair believes that 
Stansted airport will be sold in the next 6-12 months, unless the BAA is successful in the Court of Appeal or unless 
it manages to appeal a negative Court of Appeal ruling to the Supreme Court, which would likely delay the sale 
further.  Following the December 2003 publication of the U.K. government's White Paper on Airport Capacity in the 
Southeast of England, the BAA in 2004 announced plans to spend up to GBP4 billion on a multi-year project to 
construct a second runway and additional terminal facilities at London (Stansted) airport with a target opening date 
of 2013. Ryanair and other airlines using London (Stansted) support the principle of a second runway at London 
(Stansted), but are opposed to this development because they believe that the financing of what they consider to be 
an overblown project will lead to airport costs approximately doubling from current

 Ryanair has offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain the Aer Lingus brand, and to grow its 
traffic from 9.5 million to over 14.5 million passengers over a five year period post acquisition, by growing Aer 
Lingus' short haul traffic at some of Europe's major airports where Aer Lingus currently operates and Ryanair does 
not. Ryanair also intends to increase Aer Lingus' transatlantic traffic from Ireland, which has fallen in recent years, 
by investing in operations. If the offer is accepted, the Irish government would receive EUR173 million in cash. The 
offer of EUR1.30 per share represented a premium of approximately 38% over the closing price of EUR0.94 for Aer 
Lingus shares as of June 19, 2012. The offer is conditional on competition approval by the European Commission. 
The Company anticipates that the EU merger review process will be completed between September 2012 and 
February 2013.
 The available for sale financial asset balance sheet value of EUR149.7million reflects the market value of the 
Company's stake in Aer Lingus as of March 31, 2012, as compared to a value of EUR114.0 million as of March 31, 
2011. In accordance with the company's accounting policy, this investment is held at fair value. This investment is 
classified as available-for-sale, rather than as an investment in an associate, because the Company does not have 
the power to exercise any influence over Aer Lingus. The change in the available for sale financial asset from 
EUR114.0 million at March 31, 2011 to EUR149.7 million at March 31, 2012 is comprised of a gain of EUR35.7 
million, recognised through other comprehensive income, reflecting the increase in the share price from EUR0.72 
per share at March 31, 2011 to EUR0.94 per share at March 31, 2012. All impairment losses are required to be 
recognized in the income statement and are not subsequently reversed, while gains are recognized through other 
comprehensive income.  The investment had in prior periods been impaired to EUR0.50 per share.  In fiscal year 
2010, the Company recorded an impairment charge of EUR13.5 million in the income statement on its Aer Lingus 
shareholding.
 The Company's determination that it does not have control, or even exercise a "significant influence," over Aer 
Lingus through its minority shareholding has been based on the following factors:
 (i) Ryanair does not have any representation on the Aer Lingus Board of Directors; nor does it have a right to 
appoint a director.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -35-
 (ii) Ryanair does not participate in Aer Lingus policy-making decisions; nor does it have a right to participate in 
such policy-making decisions.
 (iii) There are no material transactions between Ryanair and Aer Lingus, there is no interchange of personnel 
between the two companies and there is no sharing of technical information between the companies.
 (iv) Aer Lingus and its significant shareholder (the Irish government: 25.1%) have historically openly opposed 
Ryanair's investment or participation in the company.
 (v) In August 2007, September 2007 and November/December 2011, Aer Lingus refused Ryanair's attempt to 
assert its statutory right to requisition a general meeting (a legal right of any 10% shareholder under Irish law).
 (vi) On April 15, 2011, the High Court in Dublin ruled that Aer Lingus was not obliged to accede to Ryanair's 
request that two additional resolutions (on the payment of a dividend and on payments to pension schemes) be put 
to vote at Aer Lingus' annual general meeting; and
 (vii) The European Commission has formally found that Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus does not grant 
Ryanair "de jure or de facto control of Aer Lingus" and that "Ryanair's rights as a minority shareholder...are 
associated exclusively to rights related to the protection of minority shareholders" (Commission Decision Case No. 
COMP/M.4439 dated October 11, 2007). The European Commission's finding has been confirmed by the European 
Union's General Court which issued a decision on July 6, 2010 that the European Commission was justified to use 
the required legal and factual standard in its refusal to order Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding in Aer 
Lingus and that, as part of that decision, Ryanair's shareholding did not confer control of Aer Lingus (Judgment of 
the General Court (Third Chamber) Case No. T-411/07 dated July 6, 2010).
 Historical Results Are Not Predictive of Future Results
 The historical results of operations discussed herein may not be indicative of Ryanair's future operating 
performance. Ryanair's future results of operations will be affected by, among other things, overall passenger traffic 
volume; the availability of new airports for expansion; fuel prices; the airline pricing environment in a period of 
increased competition; the ability of Ryanair to finance its planned acquisition of aircraft and to discharge the 
resulting debt service obligations; economic and political conditions in Ireland, the U.K. and the EU; terrorist threats 
or attacks within the EU; seasonal variations in travel; developments in government regulations, litigation and labor 
relations; foreign currency fluctuations, the impact of the banking crisis and potential break-up of the euro, 
competition and the public's perception regarding the safety of low-fares airlines; the value of its equity stake in Aer 
Lingus; changes in aircraft acquisition, leasing, and other operating costs; flight interruptions caused by volcanic 
ash emissions or other atmospheric disruptions, the rates of income and corporate taxes paid, and the impact of the 
financial and eurozone crisis. Ryanair expects its depreciation, staff and fuel charges to increase as additional 
aircraft and related flight equipment are acquired. Future fuel costs may also increase as a result of the depletion of 
petroleum reserves, the shortage of fuel production capacity and/or production restrictions imposed by fuel oil 
producers. Maintenance expenses may also increase as a result of Ryanair's fleet expansion and replacement 
program. In addition, the financing of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft will increase the total amount of the Company's 
outstanding debt and the payments it is obliged to make to service such debt. The cost of insurance coverage for 
certain third-party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or terrorism increased dramatically following the September 
11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Although Ryanair currently passes on increased insurance costs to passengers by means 
of a special "insurance levy" on each ticket, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be successful in doing 
so. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe 
Negative Impact on the International Airline Industry."
 RECENT OPERATING RESULTS
 The Company's profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 (the first quarter of the Company's 2013 fiscal 
year) was EUR98.8 million, as compared to EUR139.3 million for the corresponding period of the previous year. 
The Company recorded a decrease in operating profit, from EUR169.9 million in the first quarter of the 2012 fiscal 
year to EUR132.0 million in the recently completed quarter. Total operating revenues increased from EUR1,155.4 
million in the first quarter of 2012 to EUR1,283.9 million in the first quarter of 2013. The decrease in operating profit 
was primarily due to a 27% increase in fuel costs, offset by a 4% increase in average fares and strong ancillary 
revenues. Operating expenses increased from EUR985.5 million in the first quarter of 2012 to EUR1,151.9 million in 
the first quarter of 2013, due primarily to the 27% increase in fuel costs and an increase in other operating costs 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -35-
associated with a higher level of activity in line with the growth of the airline. The Company's cash and cash 
equivalents, restricted cash and financial assets with terms of less than three months amounted to EUR3,807.6 
million at June 30, 2012 as compared with EUR3,213.8 million at June 30, 2011.
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 The following discussion and analysis of Ryanair's financial condition and results of operations is based on its 
consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 18 and prepared in accordance with IFRS.
 The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 The Company believes that its critical accounting policies, which are those that require management's most 
difficult, subjective and complex judgments, are those described in this section. These critical accounting policies, 
the judgments and other uncertainties affecting application of these policies and the sensitivity of reported results to 
changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered in reviewing the consolidated financial 
statements included in Item 18 and the discussion and analysis below. For additional detail on these policies, see 
Note 1, "Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements included 
in Item 18.
 Long-lived Assets
 As of March 31, 2012, Ryanair had EUR4.9 billion of long-lived assets, virtually all of which were aircraft. In 
accounting for long-lived assets, Ryanair must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the 
expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and 
the cash flows they generate.

 Increased Costs for Possible Future ADR and Share Repurchases. In April 2012, the Company held an 
extraordinary general meeting to authorize the directors to repurchase Ordinary Shares and ADRs for up to 5% of 
the issued share capital of the Company traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ").  Up until April 2012, 
shareholders had only authorized the directors to repurchase Ordinary Shares. As the ADRs typically trade at a 
premium of 15% to 20% compared to Ordinary Shares, this may result in increased costs in performing share buy-
backs in the future. At this time the Company has not decided whether it will complete further share repurchases 
and whether it will repurchase Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
 Item 4. Information on the Company
 INTRODUCTION
 Ryanair Holdings was incorporated in 1996 as a holding company for Ryanair Limited. The latter operates an ultra-
low cost, scheduled-passenger airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes between Ireland, the U.K., 
Continental Europe, and Morocco. Incorporated in 1984, Ryanair Limited began to introduce a low-fares operating 
model under a new management team in the early 1990s. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and 
Prospect - History." As of June 30, 2012, with its operating fleet of 294 Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, 
Ryanair Limited offered over 1,500 scheduled short-haul flights per day serving approximately 160 airports largely 
throughout Europe. See "[3/4]Route System, Scheduling and Fares[3/4]Route System and Scheduling" for more 
details of Ryanair's route network. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects[3/4]Seasonal 
Fluctuations" for information about the seasonality of Ryanair's business.
 Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR560.4 million in the 2012 fiscal year, as 
compared to a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR374.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year. This increase 
was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues of approximately 21% from EUR3,629.5 million to EUR4,390.2 
million, partially offset by an increase in fuel costs of approximately 30% from EUR1,227.0 million to EUR1,593.6 
million. Ryanair generated an average booked passenger load factor of approximately 82% and average scheduled 
passenger revenues of EUR0.061 per ASM in the 2012 fiscal year. The Company has focused on maintaining low 
operating costs (EUR0.052 per ASM in the 2012 fiscal year).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -23-
 The market's acceptance of Ryanair's low-fares service is reflected in the "Ryanair Effect" - Ryanair's history of 
stimulating significant annual passenger traffic growth on the new routes on which it has commenced service since 
1991. For example, on the basis of the "U.K. Airports Annual Statement of Movements, Passengers and Cargo" 
published by the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority and statistics released by the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(the "ICAO"), the number of scheduled airline passengers traveling between Dublin and London increased from 1.7 
million passengers in 1991 to 3.7 million passengers in the 2011 calendar year. Most international routes Ryanair 
has begun serving since 1991 have recorded significant traffic growth in the period following Ryanair's 
commencement of service, with Ryanair capturing the largest portion of such growth on each such route. A variety 
of factors contributed to this increase in air passenger traffic, including the relative strength of the Irish, U.K., and 
European economies in past years. However, management believes that the most significant factors driving such 
growth across all its European routes have been Ryanair's low-fares policy and its superiority to its competitors in 
terms of flight punctuality, levels of lost baggage, and rates of flight cancellations.
 The address of Ryanair Holdings' registered office is: c/o Ryanair Limited, Corporate Head Office, Dublin Airport, 
County Dublin, Ireland. The Company's contact person regarding this Annual Report on Form 20-F is: Howard 
Millar, Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer (same address as above). The telephone number is 
+353-1-812-1212 and the facsimile number is +353-1-812-1213. Under its current Articles, Ryanair Holdings has an 
unlimited corporate duration.
 STRATEGY
 Ryanair's objective is to firmly establish itself as Europe's biggest scheduled passenger airline, through continued 
improvements and expanded offerings of its low-fares service. In the highly challenging current operating 
environment, Ryanair seeks to offer low fares that generate increased passenger traffic while maintaining a 
continuous focus on cost-containment and operating efficiencies. The key elements of Ryanair's long-term strategy 
are:
 Low Fares. Ryanair's low fares are designed to stimulate demand, particularly from fare-conscious leisure and 
business travelers who might otherwise use alternative forms of transportation or choose not to travel at all. Ryanair 
sells seats on a one-way basis, thus eliminating minimum stay requirements from all travel on Ryanair scheduled 
services. Ryanair sets fares on the basis of the demand for particular flights and by reference to the period 
remaining to the date of departure of the flight, with higher fares charged on flights with higher levels of demand and 
for bookings made nearer to the date of departure. Ryanair also periodically runs special promotional fare 
campaigns. See "-Route System, Scheduling and Fares-Low and Widely Available Fares" below.
 Customer Service. Ryanair's strategy is to deliver the best customer service performance in its peer group. 
According to the data available from the Association of European Airlines ("AEA") and airlines' own published 
statistics, Ryanair has achieved better punctuality, fewer lost bags, and fewer cancellations than its peer group in 
Europe. Ryanair achieves this by focusing strongly on the execution of these services and by primarily operating 
from un-congested airports. Ryanair conducts a daily conference call with Ryanair and airport personnel at each of 
its base airports, during which the reasons for each "first wave" flight delay and baggage short-shipment are 
discussed in detail and logged to ensure that the root cause is identified and rectified. Subsequent (consequential) 
delays and short shipments are investigated by Ryanair ground operations personnel. Customer satisfaction is also 
measured by regular online, mystery-passenger and by passenger surveys.
 Frequent Point-to-Point Flights on Short-Haul Routes. Ryanair provides frequent point-to-point service on short-
haul routes to secondary and regional airports in and around major population centers and travel destinations. In 
the 2012 fiscal year, Ryanair flew an average route length of 771 miles and an average flight duration of 
approximately 1.77 hours. Short-haul routes allow Ryanair to offer its low fares and frequent service, while 
eliminating the need to provide unnecessary "frills," like in-flight meals and movies, otherwise expected by 
customers on longer flights. Point-to-point flying (as opposed to hub-and-spoke service) allows Ryanair to offer 
direct, non-stop routes and avoid the costs of providing "through service," for connecting passengers, including 
baggage transfer and transit passenger assistance.
 In choosing its routes, Ryanair favors secondary airports with convenient transportation to major population centers 
and regional airports. Secondary and regional airports are generally less congested than major airports and, as a 
result, can be expected to provide higher rates of on-time departures, faster turnaround times (the time an aircraft 
spends at a gate loading and unloading passengers), fewer terminal delays, more competitive airport access, and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -23-
lower handling costs. Ryanair's "on time" performance record (arrivals within 15 minutes of schedule) for the 2012 
fiscal year was 91%. Faster turnaround times are a key element in Ryanair's efforts to maximize aircraft utilization. 
Ryanair's average scheduled turnaround time for the 2012 fiscal year was approximately 25 minutes. Secondary 
and regional airports also generally do not maintain slot requirements or other operating restrictions that can 
increase operating expenses and limit the number of allowed take-offs and landings.
 Low Operating Costs.Management believes that Ryanair's operating costs are among the lowest of any European 
scheduled-passenger airline. Ryanair strives to reduce or control four of the primary expenses involved in running a 
major scheduled airline: (i) aircraft equipment costs; (ii) personnel costs; (iii) customer service costs; and (iv) airport 
access and handling costs:
 Aircraft Equipment Costs. Ryanair's primary strategy for controlling aircraft acquisition costs is focused on 
operating a single aircraft type. Ryanair currently operates only "next generation" Boeing 737-800s. Ryanair's 
continuous acquisition of new Boeing 737-800s has already and is expected, until the end of 2012, to increase the 
size of its fleet and thus increase its aircraft equipment and related costs (on an aggregate basis). However, the 
purchase of aircraft from a single manufacturer enables Ryanair to limit the costs associated with personnel 
training, maintenance, and the purchase and storage of spare parts while also affording the Company greater 
flexibility in the scheduling of crews and equipment. Management also believes that the terms of Ryanair's contracts 
with Boeing are very favorable to Ryanair. However, as Ryanair's existing delivery program expires in November 
2012, the Company may have to consider an additional aircraft order with Boeing or other aircraft manufacturers for 
future deliveries for growth or fleet replacement purposes. See "[3/4]Aircraft" below for additional information on 
Ryanair's fleet.

Body
 Following shareholder approval at the September 2010 annual general meeting of shareholders, a EUR500 million 
special dividend was paid in October 2010. On May 21, 2012, the Company indicated that it may pay a further 
dividend of EUR0.34 per ordinary share (approximately EUR489 million) in November 2012, subject to shareholder 
approval at the annual shareholder meeting on September 21, 2012. The Company may pay other dividends from 
time to time, or it may not pay any dividends at all, as has been its practice to date. No assurances can be given 
that the Company will, or will not, pay dividends. Any cash dividends or other distributions, if made, are expected to 
be made in euro, although Ryanair Holdings' Articles provide that dividends may be declared and paid in U.S. 
dollars. In the case of ADRs, the Depositary will convert all cash dividends and other distributions payable to 
owners of ADRs into U.S. dollars to the extent that, in its judgment, it can do so on a reasonable basis, and will 
distribute the resulting U.S. dollar amounts (net of conversion expenses and any applicable fees) to the owners of 
ADRs. See "Item 12. Description of Securities Other than Equity Securities" for information regarding fees of the 
Depositary.
 Share Buy-back Program
 Following shareholder approval at the 2006 annual general meeting of shareholders, a EUR300 million share buy-
back program was formally announced on June 5, 2007. Permission was received at the annual general meeting of 
the shareholders held on September 20, 2007 to repurchase a maximum of 75.6 million Ordinary Shares 
representing 5% of the Company's then outstanding share capital. The EUR300 million share buy-back of 
approximately 59.5 million Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 3.8% of the Company's pre-existing share 
capital, was completed in November 2007. In February 2008 the Company announced a second share buy-back 
program of up to EUR200 million worth of Ordinary Shares, which was ratified by shareholders at the annual 
general meeting of the shareholders held on September 18, 2008. 18.1 million Ordinary Shares were repurchased 
under this program at a cost of approximately EUR46.0 million. The Company also completed the share buy-back 
of EUR125 million in respect of 36.5 million Ordinary Shares in the 2012 fiscal year.  In April 2012, the Company 
completed a share buy-back of 15 million Ordinary Shares at a cost of approximately EUR68 million. As a result, 
the total amount spent on the share buy-back programs was approximately EUR538.1 million.  All Ordinary Shares 
repurchased have been cancelled.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -50-
 In April 2012, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting to authorize the directors to repurchase 
Ordinary Shares and ADRs for up to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company traded on the NASDAQ.  Up 
until April 2012, shareholders had only authorized the directors to repurchase Ordinary Shares. As the ADRs 
typically trade at a premium of 15% to 20% compared to Ordinary Shares, this may result in increased costs in 
performing share buy-backs in the future. At this time the Company has not decided whether it will complete further 
share repurchases and whether it will repurchase Ordinary Shares or ADRs.

 Item 3. Key Information
 THE COMPANY
 Ryanair operates an ultra-low cost, scheduled airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes largely 
in Europe from its 51 bases in airports across Europe, which together are referred to as "Ryanair's bases 
of operations" or "Ryanair's bases."  For a list of these bases, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Route System, Scheduling and Fares."  Ryanair pioneered the low-fares operating model in Europe in the 
early 1990s. As of June 30, 2012, the Company offered over 1,500 scheduled short-haul flights per day 
serving approximately 160 airports largely throughout Europe, with an operating fleet of 294 aircraft 
flying approximately 1,500 routes. The Company also holds a 29.8% interest in Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer 
Lingus"), which it has acquired through market purchases following Aer Lingus' partial privatization in 
2006. The European Commission prohibited Ryanair's 2006 tender offer to acquire the entire share capital 
of Aer Lingus and Ryanair filed an appeal with the European Court of First Instance ("CFI"). On July 6, 
2010, the CFI upheld the European Commission's decision. On June 19, 2012 the Company made its third offer 
to purchase Aer Lingus. For additional information, see "Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial 
Information-Legal Proceedings-Matters Related to Investment in Aer Lingus." A detailed description of the 
Company's business can be found in "Item 4. Information on the Company."

Estimation of fair values
 Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm's length 
transaction between informed and willing parties, other than as part of a forced liquidation sale. The 
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the 
Company's financial instruments:
 Cash and liquid resources: Carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these 
instruments. Cash and cash resources comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and 
restricted cash.
 Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at the 
relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 
which would be payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
estimated amount Ryanair would receive or pay to terminate the contracts. Discounted cash-flow analyses 
are based on forward interest rates.
 Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk management profile at March 31, 2012, 2011 
and 2010 has been made.
 The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet categorised by 
the type of valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: Inputs are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.
 --   Level 2: Inputs are based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are 
not active, quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and model-based valuation techniques 
for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable 
market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
 --   Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability are not based on observable market data.

 Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provisions for 
impairments, if any. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Cost may 
also include transfers from other comprehensive income of any gain or loss on qualifying cash-flow hedges of 
foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost, 
less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the following 
annual rates:

 23 years from   15% of current market
 Boeing 737-800s         235(a)            date of       value of new
 aircraft, determined
 manufacture     periodically
______________
 (a)    The Company operated 294 aircraft as of March 31, 2012, of which 59 were leased.
 The Company's estimate of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values is 15% of current market 
value of new aircraft, determined periodically, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft 
disposals during prior periods.
 An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed on acquisition to its service potential, 
reflecting the maintenance condition of its engines and airframe. This cost, which can equate to a 
substantial element of the total aircraft cost, is amortised over the shorter of the period to the next 
maintenance check (usually between 8 and 12 years for Boeing 737-800 aircraft) or the remaining life of 
the aircraft. The costs of subsequent major airframe and engine maintenance checks are capitalised and 
amortised over the shorter of the period to the next check or the remaining life of the aircraft.
 Advance and option payments made in respect of aircraft purchase commitments and options to acquire 
aircraft are recorded at cost and separately disclosed within property, plant and equipment. On 
acquisition of the related aircraft, these payments are included as part of the cost of aircraft and are 
depreciated from that date.
 Rotable spare parts held by the Company are classified as property, plant and equipment if they are 
expected to be used over more than one period.
 Gains and losses on disposal of items of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the 
proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised on a 
net basis within other income/(expenses) in profit or loss.
 Aircraft maintenance costs
 The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned 
aircraft is described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.
 For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return 
the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the 
airframe, engines and life-limited parts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, 
maintenance, in the form of major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major 
life-limited parts, is required to be performed during the period of the lease and upon return of the 
aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance costs and the costs associated with 
the restitution of major life-limited parts, are accrued and charged to profit or loss over the lease term 
for this contractual obligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of the major 
airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by 
reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year.
 Ryanair's aircraft operating lease agreements typically have a term of seven years, which closely 
correlates with the timing of heavy maintenance checks. The contractual obligation to maintain and 
replenish aircraft held under operating lease exists independently of any future actions within the 
control of Ryanair.  While Ryanair may, in very limited circumstances, sub-lease its aircraft, it remains 
fully liable to perform all of its contractual obligations under the 'head lease' notwithstanding any such 
sub-leasing.
 All other maintenance costs, other than major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and 
restitution of major life-limited parts costs associated with leased aircraft, are expensed as incurred.
 Intangible assets - landing rights
 Intangible assets acquired are recognised to the extent it is considered probable that expected future 
benefits will flow to the Company and the associated costs can be measured reliably. Landing rights 
acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at that date and are not 
amortised, where those rights are considered to be indefinite. The carrying values of those rights are 
reviewed for impairment at each reporting date and are subject to impairment testing when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. No impairment to the 
carrying values of the Company's intangible assets has been recorded to date.
 Available-for-sale securities
 The Company holds certain equity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, and are measured 
at fair value, less incremental direct costs, on initial recognition. Such securities are classified as 
available-for-sale, rather than as an investment in an associate if the Company does not have the power to 
exercise significant influence over the investee. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at 
fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses, are recognised in other comprehensive income 
and reflected in shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet. Fair value losses, subsequent to 
any impairments are recognised in other comprehensive income against net cumulative gains in the reserve.  
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -65-
Fair value losses below the impaired value are recognised on the income statement. The fair values of 
available-for-sale securities are determined by reference to quoted prices at each reporting date. When an 
investment is de-recognised the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income is transferred to 
the income statement.
 Such securities are considered to be impaired if there is objective evidence which indicates that events 
have occurred that can reasonably be expected to adversely affect the  future cash flows of the 
securities, such that the future cash flows do not support the current fair value of the securities. This 
includes where there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost. All 
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement and any cumulative loss in respect of an 
available-for-sale asset recognised previously in other comprehensive income is also transferred to the 
income statement.
 Other financial assets
 Other financial assets (other than available-for-sale financial assets) comprise cash deposits of greater 
than three months' maturity. All amounts are categorised as loans and receivables and are carried 
initially at fair value and then subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method in 
the balance sheet.
 Derivative financial instruments
 Ryanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and 
currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimise the impact 
of commodity price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company's earnings, cash 
flows and equity.
 To manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate 
swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and commodity contracts. These derivative financial instruments 
are generally held to maturity. The Company enters into these arrangements with the goal of hedging its 
operational and balance sheet risk. However, Ryanair's exposure to commodity price, interest rate and 
currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot be neutralised completely.
 Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, derivative financial instruments continue to be re-measured to fair value, and changes 
therein are accounted for as described below.

 The amounts listed under "Purchase Obligations" in the table reflect obligations for aircraft purchases and are 
calculated by multiplying the number of aircraft the Company is obligated to purchase under its current agreements 
with Boeing during the relevant period by the Basic Price for each aircraft pursuant to the relevant contract, with the 
dollar-denominated Basic Price being converted into euro at an exchange rate of $1.3356  = EUR1.00 (based on 
the European Central Bank Rate on March 31, 2012). The relevant amounts therefore exclude the effect of the 
price concessions granted to Ryanair by Boeing and CFM, as well as any application of the Escalation Factor. As a 
result, Ryanair's actual expenditures for aircraft during the relevant periods will be lower than the amounts listed 
under "Purchase Obligations" in the table.
 With respect to purchase obligations under the terms of the 2005 Boeing contract, the Company was required to 
pay Boeing 1% of the Basic Price of each of the 70 firm-order Boeing 737-800 aircraft at the time the contract was 
signed in February 2005, and will be required to make periodic advance payments of the purchase price for each 
aircraft it has agreed to purchase during the course of the two-year period preceding the delivery of each aircraft. 
As a result of these required advance payments, the Company will have paid up to 30% of the Basic Price of each 
aircraft prior to its delivery (including the addition of an estimated "Escalation Factor" but before deduction of any 
credit memoranda and other concessions); the balance of the net price is due at the time of delivery.
 The amounts listed under "Operating Lease Obligations" reflect the Company's obligations under its aircraft 
operating lease arrangements.

 OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS
 Ryanair uses certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, including financial 
guarantees and operating lease commitments. Details of each of these arrangements that have or are reasonably 
likely to have a current or future material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity 
or capital resources are discussed below.
 Operating Lease Commitments. The Company has entered into a number of sale-and-leaseback transactions in 
connection with the financing of a number of aircraft in its fleet. See "-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital

 Ryanair has offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain the Aer Lingus brand, and to grow its 
traffic from 9.5 million to over 14.5 million passengers over a five year period post acquisition, by growing Aer 
Lingus' short haul traffic at some of Europe's major airports where Aer Lingus currently operates and Ryanair does 
not. Ryanair also intends to increase Aer Lingus' transatlantic traffic from Ireland, which has fallen in recent years, 
by investing in operations. If the offer is accepted, the Irish government would receive EUR173 million in cash. The 
offer of EUR1.30 per share represented a premium of approximately 38% over the closing price of EUR0.94 for Aer 
Lingus shares as of June 19, 2012. The offer is conditional on competition approval by the European Commission.  
The Company anticipates that the EU Merger review process will be completed between September 2012 and 
February 2013.
 Legal Actions Against Monopoly Airports. Ryanair has been involved in a number of legal and regulatory actions 
against the Dublin and London (Stansted) airports in relation to what Ryanair considers to be ongoing abuses of 
their dominant positions in the Dublin and London (Stansted) markets. Management believes that both of these 
airports have been engaging in "regulatory gaming" in order to achieve inflated airport charges under the regulatory 
processes in the U.K. and Ireland. By inflating its so-called "regulated asset base" (essentially the value of its airport 
facilities), a regulated airport can achieve higher returns on its assets through inflated airport charges. With respect 
to London (Stansted), the OFT, following complaints from Ryanair and other airlines, has recognized that the 
regulatory process is flawed and provides perverse incentives to regulated airports to spend excessively on 
infrastructure in order to inflate their airport charges. The OFT referred the case to the Competition Commission 
which released its preliminary findings in April 2008. It found that the common ownership by BAA of the three main 
airports in London affects competition and that the "light touch" regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority was having 
an adverse impact on competition. In March 2009, the Competition Commission published its final report on the 
BAA and ordered the breakup of the BAA, (which will involve the sale of London (Gatwick) and London (Stansted) 
and either Glasgow or Edinburgh Airport in Scotland). In October 2009 London (Gatwick) was sold to Global 
Infrastructure Partners for GBP1.5 billion. In May 2009, BAA appealed the Competition Commission's decision on 
the bases of apparent bias and lack of proportionality. Ryanair secured the right to intervene in this appeal in 
support of the Competition Commission. The case was heard in October 2009 and in February 2010 the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal quashed the Competition Commission's ruling on the basis of the "apparent bias" 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -49-
claim. This decision was successfully appealed by both the Competition Commission and Ryanair before the Court 
of Appeal. The appeal was heard in June 2010 and the judgment was issued in October 2010, quashing the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal ruling and reinstating the Competition Commission March 2009 decision. In February 
2011, the Supreme Court refused to grant the BAA permission to appeal the Court of Appeal ruling. The 
Competition Commission has subsequently reconsidered the appropriateness of the remedies imposed on the BAA 
in March 2009 in light of the passage of time, and confirmed in its preliminary report in April 2011 that the remedies 
are still appropriate and the sale of Stansted and one of either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports should proceed. In 
July 2011, the Competition Commission confirmed its March 2011 provisional decision on "possible material 
changes of circumstances." It found that no material changes of circumstances (that would necessitate a change in 
the remedies package) have occurred since the March 2009 decision requiring the BAA to sell Gatwick, Stansted 
and one of either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports, and that consequently the BAA should proceed to dispose of 
Stansted and one of the Scottish airports. The BAA appealed this decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and 
lost on February 1, 2012. The BAA then brought a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, which they also lost on 
July 26, 2012. The BAA then announced that they intend to appeal this decision to the UK Supreme Court in 2012. 
While these appeals were ongoing, the BAA proceeded to sell Edinburgh airport in April 2012. Ryanair believes that 
Stansted airport will be sold in the next 6-12 months, unless the BAA is successful in the Court of Appeal or unless 
it manages to appeal a negative Court of Appeal ruling to the Supreme Court, which would likely delay the sale 
further.
 With respect to Dublin airport, Ryanair appealed the December 2009 decision of the CAR, which set maximum 
charges at the airport for 2010 through 2014, to the Appeals Panel set up by the Minister for Transport. In June 
2010, the Appeals Panel found in favor of Ryanair on the matter of differential pricing between Terminal 1 and 
Terminal 2, recommending that such differential pricing be imposed by the CAR. The CAR subsequently overruled 
the decision of the Appeals panel and allowed the charges increase at Dublin Airport, with no differential pricing 
between Terminals 1 and 2.
 Ryanair has also been trying to prevent both the BAA in London and the DAA in Dublin from engaging in wasteful 
capital expenditure. In the case of London (Stansted) Airport, the BAA was planning to spend GBP4 billion on a 
second runway and terminal, which Ryanair believes should only cost approximately GBP1 billion. Following the 
final decision of the Competition Commission forcing BAA to sell London (Stansted) airport, Ryanair believed that it 
was highly unlikely that BAA's planned GBP4 billion plans would proceed. The  Liberal/Conservative government in 
the U.K. had also outlined that it would not approve the building of any more runways in the Southeast of England. 
Consequently, in May 2010, the BAA announced that it would not pursue its plans to develop a second runway at 
London (Stansted).
 In the case of Dublin, the DAA has built a second terminal, costing over four times its initial estimate. When the 
DAA first announced plans to build a second terminal ("Terminal 2") at Dublin Airport, it estimated that the proposed 
expansion would cost between EUR170 million and EUR200 million. Ryanair supported a development of this 
scale; however, in September 2006, the DAA announced that the construction of Terminal 2 would cost 
approximately EUR800 million. Subsequently, the cost of the new infrastructure rose in excess of EUR1.2 billion. 
Ryanair opposed expansion at what it believed to be an excessive cost. On August 29, 2007, however the relevant 
planning authority approved the planning application from the DAA for the building of Terminal 2, and other 
facilities, all of which went ahead. On May 1, 2010, the airport fees per departing passenger increased by 27% from 
EUR13.61 to EUR17.23, and by a further 12% in 2011 following the opening of Terminal 2 in November 2010 in 
accordance with the CAR's decision of December 4, 2009 in relation to airport charges between 2010 and 2014. 
Ryanair sought a judicial review of the planning approval, however, this appeal was unsuccessful. The increase in 
charges, in combination with the introduction of the EUR10 Air Travel Tax (subsequently reduced to EUR3) 
mentioned above, led to substantially reduced passenger volumes to and from Dublin Airport.  See "Item 3. Risk 
Factors[3/4]Risks Related to the Company[3/4]Ryanair's Continued Growth is Dependent on Access to Suitable 
Airports; Charges for Airport Access are Subject to Increase" and "-The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings 
Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports," as well as "Item 4. Information on the Company-Airport Operations-Airport 
Charges."
 Legal Proceedings Against Internet Ticket Touts. The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings 
against internet ticket touts (screenscraper websites) in Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy and 
Switzerland. Screenscraper websites gain unauthorized access to Ryanair's website and booking system, extract 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -49-
flight and pricing information and display it on their own websites for sale to customers at prices which include 
intermediary fees on top of Ryanair's fares. Ryanair does not allow any such commercial use of its website and 
objects to the practice of screenscraping also on the basis of certain legal principles, such as database rights, 
copyright protection, etc. The Company's objective is to prevent any unauthorized use of its website. The Company 
also believes that the selling of airline tickets by screenscraper websites is inherently anti-consumer as it inflates 
the cost of air travel. At the same time, Ryanair encourages genuine price comparison websites which allow 
consumers to compare prices of several airlines and then refer consumers to the airline website in order to perform 
the booking at the original fare. Ryanair offers licensed access to its flight and pricing information to such websites. 
The Company has received favorable rulings in Ireland, Germany and The Netherlands. However, pending the 
outcome of these legal proceedings and if Ryanair were to be unsuccessful in them, the activities of screenscraper 
websites could lead to a reduction in the number of customers who book directly on Ryanair's website and 
consequently in a reduction in the ancillary revenue stream. Also, some customers may be lost to the Company 
once they are presented by a screenscraper website with a Ryanair fare inflated by the screenscraper's 
intermediary fee. See Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Ryanair Faces Risks 
Related to Unauthorized Use of Information from the Company's Website."

Body
 The Chairman, on behalf of the Board, reviews the evaluations of performance of the non-executive 
directors on an annual basis. The non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, meet 
annually without the Chairman present to evaluate his performance, having taken into account the views of 
the executive director. The non-executive directors also evaluate the performance of the executive 
director. These evaluations are designed to determine whether each director continues to contribute 
effectively and to demonstrate commitment to the role.
 The Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees carry out annual reviews of their own performance and 
terms of reference to ensure they are operating at maximum effectiveness and recommend any changes they 
consider necessary to the Board for approval.
 The Board considers the results of the evaluation process and any issues identified.  The above 
evaluations were conducted in May 2011 and were presented to the Board at the September 2011 Board meeting 
in respect of the year under review.
 Shareholders
 Ryanairrecognises the importance of communications with shareholders. Ryanair communicates with all of 
its shareholders following the release of quarterly and annual results directly via road shows, investor 
days and/or by conference calls. The Chief Executive, senior financial, operational, and commercial 
management participate in these events.
 During the year ended March 31, 2012 the Company held discussions with a substantial number of 
institutional investors.
 The Board is kept informed of the views of shareholders through the executive director's and executive 
management's attendance at investor presentations and results presentations. Furthermore, relevant 
feedback from such meetings and investor relations analyst reports are provided to the entire Board on a 
regular basis. In addition, the Board determines, on a case by case basis, specific issues where it would 
be appropriate for the Chairman and/or Senior Independent Director to communicate directly with 
shareholders or to indicate that they are available to communicate if shareholders so wish. If any of the 
non-executive directors wishes to attend meetings with major shareholders, arrangements are made 
accordingly.
 General Meetings
 All shareholders are given adequate notice of the AGM at which the Chairman reviews the results and 
comments on current business activity. Financial, operational and other information on the Company is 
provided on our website at www.ryanair.com.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -8-
 Ryanair will continue to propose a separate resolution at the AGM on each substantially separate issue, 
including a separate resolution relating to the Directors' Report and financial statements. In order to 
comply with the 2010 Code, proxy votes will be announced at the AGM, following each vote on a show of 
hands, except in the event of a poll being called. The Board Chairman and the Chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees are available to answer questions from all shareholders.
 The Chief Executive makes a presentation at the Annual General Meeting on the Group's business and its 
performance during the prior year and answers questions from shareholders. The AGM affords shareholders 
the opportunity to question the Chairman and the Board.
 All holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote at general meetings of the Company, 
subject to limitations described under note "Limitations on the Right to Own Shares" on page 114. In 
accordance with Irish company law, the Company specifies record dates for general meetings, by which date 
shareholders must be registered in the Register of Members of the Company to be entitled to attend.  
Record dates are specified in the notes to the Notice convening the meeting.
 Shareholders may exercise their right to vote by appointing a proxy/proxies, by electronic means or in 
writing, to vote some or all of their shares. The requirements for the receipt of valid proxy forms are 
set out in the notes to the Notice convening the Meeting.
 A shareholder or group of shareholders, holding at least 5% of the issued share capital has the right to 
requisition a general meeting. A shareholder, or a group of shareholders, holding at least 3% of the 
issued share capital of the Company, has the right to put an item on the agenda of an AGM or to table a 
draft resolution for an item on the agenda of the general meeting provided that such item is accompanied 
by reasons justifying its inclusion or the full text of any draft resolution proposed to be adopted at the 
general meeting. A request by a member to put an item on the agenda or to table a draft resolution shall 
be received by the company in hardcopy form or in electronic form at least 42 days before the AGM to which 
it relates.
 Notice of the Annual General Meeting and the Form of Proxy are sent to shareholders at least twenty-one 
working days before the meeting. The Company's Annual Report is available on the Company's website,       
     www.ryanair.com. The 2012 Annual General Meeting will be held at 9am on September 21, 2012 in the 
Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport, Co Dublin, Ireland.
 All general meetings other than the Annual General Meeting are called Extraordinary General Meetings 
(EGMs). An EGM must be called by giving at least twenty-one clear days' notice. Except in relation to an 
adjourned meeting, three members, present in person or by proxy, entitled to vote upon the business to be 
transacted, shall be a quorum. The passing of resolutions at a general meeting, other than special 
resolution, requires a simple majority. To be passed, a special resolution requires a majority of at least 
75% of the votes cast. Votes may be given in person by a show of hands, or by proxy.
 At the Meeting, after each resolution has been dealt with, details are given of the level of proxy votes 
cast on each resolution and the numbers for, against and withheld.  This information is made available on 
the Company's website following the meeting.
 Risk Management and Internal Control
 The directors have overall responsibility for the Company's system of risk management and internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the system 
of risk management and internal control which is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
 In accordance with the revised FRC (Turnbull) guidance for directors on internal control published in 
October 2005, 'Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code', the Board confirms 
that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing any significant risks faced by 
the Group, that it has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the 
financial statements and that this process is regularly reviewed by the Board.
 In accordance with the provisions of the 2010 Code the directors review the effectiveness of the 
Company's system of internal control including:
 --   Financial
 --   Operational
 --   Compliance
 --   Risk Management
 The Board is ultimately responsible for the Company's system of risk management and internal controls and 
for monitoring its effectiveness. The key procedures that have been established to provide effective risk 
management and internal control include:
 --   a strong and independent Board which meets at least 4 times a year and has separate Chief Executive 
and Chairman roles;
 --   a clearly defined organisational structure along functional lines and a clear division of 
responsibility and authority in the Company;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -8-
 --   a comprehensive system of internal financial reporting which includes preparation of detailed 
monthly management accounts, providing key performance indicators and financial results for each major 
function within the Company;
 --   preparation and issue of financial reports to shareholders and the markets, including the Annual 
Report and consolidated financial statements, is overseen by the Audit Committee. The Company's financial 
reporting process is controlled using documented accounting policies and reporting formats, supplemented 
by detailed instructions and guidance on reporting requirements. The Company's processes support the 
integrity and quality of data, including appropriate segregation of duties. The financial information of 
the parent entity and all subsidiary entities, which form the basis for the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements are subject to scrutiny by Group level senior management. The Company's 
financial reports, financial guidance, and Annual Report and consolidated financial statements are also 
reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board in advance of being presented to the full Board for their 
review and approval;
 --   quarterly reporting of the financial performance with a management discussion and analysis of 
results;
 --   weekly Management Committee meetings, comprising of heads of departments, to review the performance 
and activities of each department in the Company;
 --   detailed budgetary process which includes identifying risks and opportunities and which is 
ultimately approved at Board level;
 --   Board approved capital expenditure and Audit Committee approved treasury policies which clearly 
define authorisation limits and procedures;
 --   an internal audit function which reviews key financial/business processes and controls, and which 
has full and unrestricted access to the Audit Committee;
 --   an Audit Committee which approves audit plans, considers significant control matters raised by 
management and the internal and external auditors and which is actively monitoring the Company's 
compliance with section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002;
 --   established systems and procedures to identify, control and report on key risks. Exposure to these 
risks is monitored by the Audit Committee and the Management Committee; and

 Changes in the Display of the Administration Fee. Following agreement with certain European competition and 
consumer protection authorities during 2012, Ryanair will incorporate its Administration Fee in all advertised prices 
and in all prices displayed during its booking process. Currently the Administration Fee can be avoided by 
passengers who use the Ryanair Cash Passport debit card as their form of payment. Following the change, since 
Ryanair offers discounted fares whereby certain fees and levies are waived, there is no certainty that the 
Administration Fee will be paid by all passengers. If a significant proportion of passengers do not pay the 
Administration Fee, this change could result in a significant reduction in the fees collected, which could have a 
material adverse impact on the financial performance of Ryanair. This change to the Administration Fee will be 
effective in the UK and Italy on December 1, 2012 and elsewhere across our network shortly thereafter.
 The Company Will Incur Significant Costs Acquiring New Aircraft and Any Instability in the Credit and Capital 
Markets Could Negatively Impact Ryanair's Ability to Obtain Financing on Acceptable Terms. Ryanair's continued 
growth is dependent upon its ability to acquire additional aircraft to meet additional capacity needs and to replace 
older aircraft.  Ryanair expects to have 305aircraft in its fleet by March 31, 2013.  For additional information on the 
Company's aircraft fleet and expansion plans, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Aircraft" and "Item 5. 
Operating and Financial Review and Prospects[3/4]Liquidity and Capital Resources." There can be no assurance 
that this planned expansion will not outpace the growth of passenger traffic on Ryanair's routes or that traffic growth 
will not prove to be greater than the expanded fleet can accommodate. In either case, such developments could 
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 Ryanair plans to finance its remaining purchases of firm-order aircraft (aircraft it is obliged to buy under its 
contracts with The Boeing Company ("Boeing")) through a combination of bank loans, operating and finance leases 
- including via sale-and-leaseback transactions - and cash flow generated from the Company's operations. As in the 
past, Ryanair expects much of its financing to be supported by guarantees granted by the Export-Import Bank of the 
United States ("Ex-Im Bank"). Nonetheless, due to the general deterioration in the availability of bank credit facilities 
in recent years, no assurance can be given that sufficient financing will be available to Ryanair or that the terms of 
any such financing will be favorable. Any inability of the Company to obtain financing for new aircraft on reasonable 
terms could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -17-
 In addition, the financing of new and existing Boeing 737-800 aircraft has already, and will continue to, significantly 
increase the total amount of the Company's outstanding debt and the payments it is obliged to make to service 
such debt. The level of outstanding debt is expected to fall, however, in fiscal year 2014 as the Company has not 
entered into any contracts to purchase additional or replacement aircraft. Furthermore, Ryanair's ability to draw 
down funds under its existing bank-loan facilities to pay for aircraft as they are delivered is subject to various 
conditions imposed by the counterparties to such bank loan facilities and related loan guarantees, and any future 
financing is expected to be subject to similar conditions. The Company currently has arranged financing for all 11 
remaining aircraft to be delivered in the period between the date hereof and March 2013. For additional details on 
Ryanair's financings, see "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Liquidity and Capital Resources."
 Ryanair has also entered into significant derivative transactions intended to hedge its current aircraft acquisition-
related debt obligations. These derivative transactions expose Ryanair to certain risks and could have adverse 
effects on its results of operations and financial condition. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market Risk."
 The Company's Growth May Expose It to Risks. Ryanair's operations have grown rapidly since it pioneered the 
low-fares operating model in Europe in the early 1990s, although it only plans to grow by 4% in fiscal 2013. See 
"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects[3/4]History." During the 2012 fiscal year, Ryanair 
announced 330 new routes across its network and intends to continue to expand its fleet and add new destinations 
and additional flights, which are expected to increase Ryanair's booked passenger volumes in the 2013 fiscal year 
to approximately 79 million passengers, an increase from the approximately 76 million passengers booked in the 
2012 fiscal year. However, no assurance can be given that this target will in fact be met. If growth in passenger 
traffic and Ryanair's revenues do not keep pace with the planned expansion of its fleet, Ryanair could suffer from 
overcapacity and its results of operations and financial condition (including its ability to fund scheduled aircraft 
purchases and related debt) could be materially adversely affected. See "-Risks Related to the Airline Industry-
Volcanic Ash Emissions Could Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's Results 
of Operations."
 The expansion of Ryanair's fleet and operations, although somewhat slower than in previous years, in addition to 
other factors, may also strain existing management resources and related operational, financial, management 
information and information technology systems, including Ryanair's Internet-based reservation system, to the point 
that they may no longer be adequate to support Ryanair's operations. This would require Ryanair to make 
significant additional expenditures. Expansion will generally require additional skilled personnel, equipment, 
facilities and systems. An inability to hire skilled personnel or to secure required equipment and facilities efficiently 
and in a cost-effective manner may adversely affect Ryanair's ability to achieve growth plans and sustain or 
increase its profitability.
 Ryanair's New Routes and Expanded Operations may have an Adverse Financial Impact on its Results. Currently, 
a substantial number of carriers operate routes that compete with Ryanair's, and the Company expects to face 
further intense competition. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Industry Overview[3/4]European Market."
 When Ryanair commences new routes, its load factors and fares tend to be lower than those on its established 
routes and its advertising and other promotional costs tend to be higher, which may result in initial losses that could 
have a material negative impact on the Company's results of operations as well as require a substantial amount of 
cash to fund. In addition, there can be no assurance that Ryanair's low-fares service will be accepted on new 
routes. Ryanair also periodically runs special promotional fare campaigns, in particular in connection with the 
opening of new routes. Promotional fares may have the effect of increasing load factors and reducing Ryanair's 
yield and passenger revenues on such routes during the periods that they are in effect. See "Item 4. Information on 
the Company-Route System, Scheduling and Fares." Ryanair expects to have other significant cash needs as it 
expands, including as regards the cash required to fund aircraft purchases or aircraft deposits related to the 
acquisition of additional Boeing 737-800s, although Ryanair has only another 11 aircraft to finance under the terms 
of its purchase agreement with Boeing. There can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient cash to 
make such expenditures and investments, and to the extent Ryanair is unable to expand its route system 
successfully, its future revenue and earnings growth will in turn be limited. Further volcanic ash emissions, similar to 
those experienced in April and May 2010, could make consumers less willing and/or able to travel and impact the 
launch of new routes or bases. See "-Risks Related to the Airline Industry-Volcanic Ash Emissions Could Affect the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -17-
Company and Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's Results of Operations." See also "-The Company 
Will Incur Significant Costs Acquiring New Aircraft and the Continued Instability in the Credit and Capital Markets 
Could Negatively Impact Ryanair's Ability to Obtain Financing on Acceptable Terms."
 Ryanair's Continued Growth is Dependent on Access to Suitable Airports; Charges for Airport Access are Subject 
to Increase. Airline traffic at certain European airports is regulated by a system of grandfathered "slot" allocations. 
Each slot represents authorization to take-off and land at the particular airport during a specified time period. 
Although the majority of Ryanair's bases currently have no slot allocations, traffic at a minority of the airports 
Ryanair serves, including its primary bases, is currently regulated through slot allocations. There can be no 
assurance that Ryanair will be able to obtain a sufficient number of slots at slot-controlled airports that it may wish 
to serve in the future, at the time it needs them, or on acceptable terms. There can also be no assurance that its 
non-slot constrained bases, or the other non-slot constrained airports Ryanair serves, will continue to operate 
without slot allocation restrictions in the future. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Government Regulation-
Slots." Airports may impose other operating restrictions such as curfews, limits on aircraft noise levels, mandatory 
flight paths, runway restrictions, and limits on the number of average daily departures. Such restrictions may limit 
the ability of Ryanair to provide service to, or increase service at, such airports.

 In March 2009, Ryanair also appealed (to the CFI) two decisions issued by the European Commission in 
November 2008 relating to the sale of Alitalia's assets to Compagnia Aerea Italiana (CAI) and to a EUR300 million 
rescue loan granted to Alitalia by the Italian government and subsequently converted into Alitalia's capital. A 
hearing in this case took place in June 2011 and judgment rejecting Ryanair's appeal was issued in March 2012. 
Ryanair appealed this ruling to the EU Court of Justice.
 Matters Related to Investment in Aer Lingus. During the 2007 fiscal year, the Company acquired 25.2% of Aer 
Lingus. The Company increased its interest to 29.3% during the 2008 fiscal year, and to 29.8% during the 2009 
fiscal year at a total aggregate cost of EUR407.2 million. Following the acquisition of its initial stake and upon the 
approval of the Company's shareholders, management proposed to effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share 
capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by the European Commission on competition 
grounds. Ryanair filed an appeal with the CFI, which was heard in July 2009. On July 6, 2010 the Court upheld the 
European Commission's decision. (see also: "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Business 
Overview").
 The then EU Commissioner for Competition, Neelie Kroes, said on June 27, 2007 that, "Since Ryanair is not in a 
position to exert de jure or de facto control over Aer Lingus, the European Commission is not in a position to require 
Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding, which is, by the way, not a controlling stake." In October 2007, the 
European Commission also reached a formal decision that it would not force Ryanair to sell its shares in Aer 
Lingus. However, Aer Lingus appealed this decision before the CFI. In January 2008, the CFI heard an application 
by Aer Lingus for interim measures limiting Ryanair's voting rights, pending a decision of the CFI on Aer Lingus' 
appeal of the European Commission's decision not to force Ryanair to sell the Aer Lingus shares. In March 2008, 
the court dismissed Aer Lingus' application for interim measures. Aer Lingus' main appeal was heard in July 2009. 
On July 6, 2010 the court rejected Aer Lingus' appeal and confirmed that Ryanair cannot be forced to dispose of its 
29.8% stake in Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus had two months and 10 days from such date to appeal this judgment to the 
Court of Justice of the EU but chose not to do so. EU legislation may change in the future to require such a forced 
disposal. If eventually forced to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus, Ryanair could suffer significant losses due to the 
negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -48-
 On December 1, 2008, Ryanair made a second offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not 
own at a price of EUR1.40 per ordinary share. Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain 
the Aer Lingus brand, and retain its Heathrow slots and connectivity. Ryanair also proposed to double Aer Lingus' 
short-haul fleet from 33 to 66 aircraft and to create 1,000 associated new jobs over a five-year period. If the offer 
had been accepted, the Irish government would have received over EUR180 million in cash. The employee share 
ownership trust and employees who owned 18% of Aer Lingus would have received over EUR137 million in cash. 
The Company met Aer Lingus management, representatives of the employee share ownership trust and other 
parties. The offer of EUR1.40 per Aer Lingus share represented a premium of approximately 25% over the closing 
price of EUR1.12 on November 28, 2008. Ryanair also advised the market that it would not proceed to seek EU 
approval for the new bid unless the shareholders agreed to sell their stakes in Aer Lingus to Ryanair. However, as 
the Company was unable to secure the shareholders' support it decided, on January 28, 2009, to withdraw its 
second offer for Aer Lingus.
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it intended 
to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected on the basis that the OFT's investigation was 
time-barred. Ryanair maintains that the OFT had and missed the opportunity to investigate Ryanair's minority stake 
within four months from the European Commission's June 2007 decision to prohibit Ryanair's takeover of Aer 
Lingus. The OFT agreed in October 2010 to suspend its investigation pending the outcome of Ryanair's appeal 
against the OFT's decision that its investigation is not time barred. On July 28, 2011, the Competition Appeal 
Tribunal ruled that the OFT was not time barred when it attempted in September 2010 to open an investigation into 
Ryanair's 2006 acquisition of a minority non-controlling stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair subsequently appealed the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal's decision.  On November 24, 2011, the UK Court of Appeal ordered a stay of the 
OFT's investigation into Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus pending the outcome of the appeal.  On May 22, 
2012, the UK Court of Appeal found that the OFT was not time barred to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer 
Lingus in September 2010. Ryanair subsequently sought permission to appeal this ruling to the UK Supreme Court 
but permission was refused.  On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in 
Aer Lingus to the UK Competition Commission. Ryanair welcomed this decision as it believes that the Competition 
Commission should find that since Ryanair has no influence over Aer Lingus through its minority stake, it cannot be 
forced to dispose of the stake. The Competition Commission could order Ryanair to divest some or all of its shares 
in Aer Lingus, as a result of which Ryanair could suffer significant losses due to the negative impact on market 
prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus'shares.
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair made a third offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not own at a 
price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share.  The Company immediately commenced pre-notification discussions with the 
European Commission for the purpose of preparing a merger filing.  Pending the outcome of the European 
Commission's review of Ryanair's bid, on the basis of the duty of "sincere cooperation" between the EU and the 
Member States, and under the EU Merger Regulation, the Competition Commission's investigation of Ryanair's 
minority stake in Aer Lingus cannot properly proceed. Nevertheless, Aer Lingus argued that the investigation should 
proceed and that Ryanair's June 19 offer was in breach of certain provisions of the UK Enterprise Act 2002. On July 
10, 2012, the Competition Commission ruled that Ryanair's bid was not in breach of the UK Enterprise Act, but 
nevertheless decided that its investigation of the minority stake can proceed in parallel with the European 
Commission's investigation of the June 19 offer.  On July 13, 2012 Ryanair appealed the latter part of the 
Competition Commission's ruling to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal. The outcome of this appeal is currently 
expected within a relatively short timeframe of approximately 3-4 weeks. Should the Competition Appeal Tribunal 
uphold Ryanair's appeal, the Competition Commission's investigation will be suspended pending the EU merger 
review process of the June 19 offer, including any subsequent appeals. Should Ryanair's appeal be rejected, the 
Competition Commission's investigation will proceed in parallel with the EU merger review process, however the 
Competition Commission could not in any event attempt to frustrate the European Commission's jurisdiction and/or 
decisions.
 The timing of the offer has been influenced by; (1) the continued consolidation of European airlines, and more 
recently the International Airlines Group (the parent company of British Airways) takeover of British Midland 
International, where the No.1 airline at Heathrow was allowed to acquire the No. 2; (2) the additional capacity 
available at Dublin airport following the opening of Terminal 2 and the decline in traffic from 23.3 million passengers 
per annum in 2007 to 18.7 million in 2011, resulting in Dublin airport operating at approximately 50% capacity; (3) 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -48-
the change in the Irish government policy since 2006 in that the Irish government has decided to sell its stake in Aer 
Lingus; (4) the fact that under the terms of the bailout agreement provided by the European Commission, European 
Central bank and International Monetary Fund to Ireland, the Irish government has committed to sell its stake in Aer 
Lingus; (5) the fact that the ESOT (Employee Share Ownership Trust) which at the time of the unsuccessful 2006 
offer controlled 15% of Aer Lingus has been disbanded since December 2010 and the shares distributed to the 
individual members, with the result that Ryanair's new offer is, in Ryanair's view, capable of reaching over 50% 
acceptance either with or without government acceptance; and (6) the fact that recently Etihad, an Abu Dhabi 
based airline, has acquired a 3% stake in Aer Lingus and has expressed an interest in buying the Irish 
government's 25% stake in Aer Lingus (the offer now provides Etihad or any other potential bidder the opportunity 
to purchase the government's stake). Ryanair is willing to offer the European Commission for Competition 
appropriate remedies to allay competition concerns, and it believes that these remedies, as well as the efficiencies 
and synergies arising from the combination, should allow the Commission to approve this proposed merger.

 The weighted-average interest rate on the cumulative borrowings under these facilities of EUR3,625.2 million at 
March 31, 2012 was 2.9%. Ryanair's ability to obtain additional loans pursuant to each of the facilities to finance the 
price of future Boeing 737-800 aircraft purchases is subject to the issuance of further bank commitments and the 
satisfaction of various contractual conditions. These conditions include, among other things, the execution of 
satisfactory documentation, the requirement that Ryanair perform all of its obligations under the Boeing agreements 
and provide satisfactory security interests in the aircraft (and related assets) in favor of the lenders and Ex-Im Bank, 
and that Ryanair not suffer a material adverse change in its conditions or prospects (financial or otherwise).
 Ex-Im Bank's policy on facilities of this type is to issue a binding final commitment approximately six months prior to 
delivery of each aircraft being financed. Ex-Im Bank has already issued final binding commitments and related 
guarantees with respect to the 199 (net of 26 aircraft disposals) Ex-Im Bank-financed Boeing 737-800 aircraft 
delivered between 2001 and March 31, 2012. Ex-Im Bank's final binding commitment is also subject to certain 
conditions set forth in the documentation for facilities and the Ex-Im Bank guarantee. These conditions include, 
among other things, the execution of satisfactory documentation, the creation and maintenance of the lease and 
related arrangements described below, that Ryanair provide satisfactory security interests in the aircraft (and 
related assets) in favor of Ex-Im Bank and the lenders, and that the subject aircraft be registered in Ireland, be 
covered by adequate insurance and maintained in a manner acceptable to Ex-Im Bank. Ryanair expects that any 
future commitments or guarantees issued by Ex-Im Bank will contain similar conditions. The terms of the facilities 
and the Ex-Im Bank guarantee require that Ryanair pay certain fees in connection with such financings. In 
particular, these fees include arrangement fees paid to the facility arranger, and a commitment fee based on the 
unutilized and non-cancelled portion of the guarantee commencing 60 days from the date of issuance of the 
guarantee and payable semi-annually in arrears. An exposure fee for the issuance of the guarantee on the date of 
delivery is also payable to Ex-Im Bank (based on the amount of the guarantee). Ryanair's payment of the applicable 
exposure fee to Ex-Im Bank (based on the amount of the loan provided) is eligible for financing under the facilities. 
Ryanair anticipates that similar fees will be incurred as additional aircraft are delivered and financed.
 As part of its Ex-Im Bank guarantee-based financing of the Boeing 737-800s, Ryanair has entered into certain 
lease agreements and related arrangements. Pursuant to these arrangements, legal title to the 199 aircraft 
delivered and remaining in the fleet as of March 31, 2012 rests with a number of United States special purpose 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -42-
vehicles (the "SPVs") in which Ryanair has no equity or other interest. The SPVs are the borrowers of record under 
the loans made or to be made under the facilities, with all of their obligations under the loans being guaranteed by 
Ryanair Holdings.
 The shares of the SPVs (which are owned by an unrelated charitable association) are in turn pledged to a security 
trustee in favor of Ex-Im Bank and the lenders. Ryanair operates each of the aircraft pursuant to a finance lease it 
has entered into with the SPVs, the terms of which mirror those of the relevant loans under the facilities. Ryanair 
has the right to purchase the aircraft upon termination of the lease for a nominal amount. Pursuant to this 
arrangement, Ryanair is considered to own the aircraft for accounting purposes under IFRS. Ryanair does not use 
special purpose entities for off-balance sheet financing or any other purpose which results in assets or liabilities not 
being reflected in Ryanair's consolidated financial statements.
 As of July 20, 2012, Ryanair had mandated a lender to provide financing for up to seven of its firm-order Boeing 
737-800 aircraft under an Ex-Im Bank financing structure and the remaining four through the use of operating 
leases, including via sale-and-leaseback transactions. The future Ex-Im Bank guarantee-based financing will be 
substantially based on terms and conditions similar to those described above. However, no assurance can be given 
that such financing will be available to Ryanair, or that the terms of any such financing will be as advantageous to 
the Company as those available at the time of the facilities. Any inability of the Company to obtain financing for the 
new aircraft on advantageous terms could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and 
financial condition.
 The Company financed 72 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between December 2003 and March 2012 
under seven-year, sale-and-leaseback arrangements with a number of international leasing companies, pursuant to 
which each lessor purchased an aircraft and leased it to Ryanair under an operating lease. Between October 2010 
and March 2012, 13 operating lease aircraft were returned to the lessor at the agreed maturity date of the lease. At 
March 31, 2012, Ryanair had 59 operating lease aircraft in the fleet. As a result, Ryanair operates, but does not 
own, these aircraft, which were leased to provide flexibility for the aircraft delivery program. Ryanair has no right or 
obligation to acquire these aircraft at the end of the relevant lease terms. Two of these leases are denominated in 
euro and require Ryanair to make variable rental payments that are linked to EURIBOR. Through the use of interest 
rate swaps, Ryanair has effectively converted the floating-rate rental payments due pursuant to these leases into 
fixed-rate rental payments. Thirty leases are denominated in euro and require Ryanair to make fixed rental 
payments over the term of the lease. The remaining 27 operating leases are U.S. dollar-denominated and two 
require Ryanair to make variable rental payments that are linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR, while a further 25 require 
Ryanair to make fixed rental payments. The Company has an option to extend the initial period of seven years on 
36 of the 59 remaining operating lease aircraft as of March 31, 2012, on pre-determined terms. Four operating 
lease arrangements will mature during the year ended March 31, 2013. The Company decided not to extend any of 
these operating leases for a secondary lease period and handed aircraft back to the lessors in April 2012. In 
addition to the above, the Company financed 30 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between March 2005 and 
March 2012 with 13-year euro-denominated JOLCOs. These structures are accounted for as finance leases and 
are initially recorded at fair value in the Company's balance sheet. Under each of these contracts, Ryanair has a 
call option to purchase the aircraft at a pre-determined price after a period of 10.5 years, which it may exercise. Six 
aircraft have been financed through euro-denominated 12-year amortizing commercial debt transactions.
 Since, under each of the Company's operating leases, the Company has a commitment to maintain the relevant 
aircraft, an accounting provision is made during the lease term for this obligation based on estimated future costs of 
major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks by making appropriate charges to the income statement 
calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year. Under IFRS, the accounting 
treatment for these costs with respect to leased aircraft differs from that for aircraft owned by the Company, for 
which such costs are capitalized and amortized.
 In 2000, Ryanair purchased a Boeing 737-800 flight simulator from CAE Electronics Limited of Quebec, Canada 
("CAE"). The simulator is being used for pilot training purposes. The gross purchase price of the simulator and the 
necessary software was approximately $10 million, not taking into account certain price concessions provided by 
the seller in the form of credit memoranda. The Company financed this expenditure with a 10-year euro-
denominated loan provided by the Export Development Corporation of Canada for up to 85% of the net purchase 
price, with the remainder provided by cash flows from operations.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -42-
 In 2002, Ryanair entered into a contract to purchase three additional Boeing 737-800 flight simulators from CAE. 
The first of these simulators was delivered in 2004 and the second and third simulators were delivered in the 2008 
fiscal year. The gross price of each simulator was approximately $10.3 million, not taking into account certain price 
concessions provided by the seller in the form of credit memoranda. In September 2006 Ryanair entered into a new 
contract with CAE to purchase B737NG Level B flight simulators. Two such simulators were delivered in the 2009 
fiscal year. The gross price of each simulator is approximately $8 million, not taking into account certain price 
concessions provided by the seller in the form of credit memoranda and discounts.
 Contractual Obligations. The table below sets forth the contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the 
Company with definitive payment terms, which will require significant cash outlays in the future, as of March 31, 
2012. These obligations primarily relate to Ryanair's aircraft purchase and related financing obligations, which are 
described in more detail above. For additional information on the Company's contractual obligations and 
commercial commitments, see Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18.
 The amounts listed under "Finance Lease Obligations" reflect the Company's obligations under its JOLCOs. See 
"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects[3/4]Liquidity and Capital Resources."

Since certain of the Ordinary Shares are held by brokers or other nominees, the number of direct record holders in 
the United States, which is reported above 68, may not be fully indicative of the number of direct beneficial owners 
in the United States, or of where the direct beneficial owners of such shares are resident.
 In order to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, beginning June 26, 2001, Ryanair 
Holdings instructed the Depositary to suspend the issuance of new ADRs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary 
Shares until further notice. Therefore, holders of Ordinary Shares cannot currently convert their Ordinary Shares 
into ADRs. The Depositary will however convert existing ADRs into Ordinary Shares at the request of the holders of 
such ADRs. The Company in 2002 implemented additional measures to restrict the ability of non-EU nationals to 
purchase Ordinary Shares. As a result, non-EU nationals are currently effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary 
Shares. See "Item 10. Additional Information-Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals" for additional 
information.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -51-

All Ordinary Shares repurchased have been cancelled.
 The maximum price at which the Company may repurchase Ordinary Shares, in accordance with the listing rules of 
the Irish Stock Exchange and of the Financial Services Authority, is the higher of 5% above the average market 
value of the Company's Ordinary Shares for the five business days prior to the day of the repurchase and the price 
stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) of 22 December 2003 (No. 2273/2003) (which is the 
higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the Irish Stock Exchange). The 
minimum price at which the Company may repurchase Ordinary Shares is their nominal value, currently 0.635 euro 
cent per share.
 At an extraordinary general meeting of Shareholders held on April 19, 2012 the Company obtained a new 
repurchase authority which will enable the Company to repurchase the Company's ADRs which are traded on 
NASDAQ. The maximum price at which Ordinary Shares which underlie the Company's ADRs can be repurchased 
is 5% above the average market value of one-fifth of the Company's ADRs as quoted on NASDAQ, for the five 
business days prior to the date of purchase (as one ADS represents five Ordinary Shares). Any ADRs purchased 
will be converted to Ordinary Shares by the Company's brokers for subsequent repurchase and cancellation by the 
Company.
 As of June 30, 2012, the total number of options over Ordinary Shares outstanding under all of the Company's 
share option plans was 17,912,382, representing 1.2% of the Company's issued share capital at that date.

 =========  ===========  ===========  ==========  ==========  ========
At March 31, 2012, aircraft with a net book value of EUR4,856.0 million (2011: EUR4,718.7 million; 2010: 
EUR3,863.0 million) were mortgaged to lenders as security for loans. Under the security arrangements for 
the Company's new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, the Company does not hold legal title to 
those aircraft while these loan amounts remain outstanding.
 At March 31, 2012, the cost and net book value of aircraft includes EUR110.5 million (2011: EUR194.2 
million; 2010: EUR397.8 million) in respect of advance payments on aircraft. This amount is not 
depreciated. The cost and net book value also includes capitalised aircraft maintenance, aircraft 
simulators and the stock of rotable spare parts.
 The net book value of assets held under finance leases at March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was EUR607.5 
million, EUR635.1 million and EUR422.8 million respectively.
 Sale proceeds of EUR27.2 million were generated from the disposal of spare engines during the year.  In 
fiscal year 2010, EUR89.2 million in sales proceeds comprised EUR65.6 million from the sale of three 
aircraft and EUR23.6 million in respect of the sale of spare engines and insurance proceeds from an 
aircraft damaged by a bird strike in 2009.
 There were no Boeing 737-800 aircraft disposed of during the year (2011: nil; 2010: 3). There is no 
agreement to dispose of further aircraft at future dates.
 During the 2012 fiscal year, no accelerated depreciation (2011: nil; 2010: nil) arose in relation to 
aircraft disposals or agreements to dispose of aircraft at future dates.

 rights......................................................................................      46.8   
46.8   46.8
 =====  =====  =====
Landing slots were acquired with the acquisition of Buzz Stansted Limited in April 2003. As these landing 
slots have no expiry date and are expected to be used in perpetuity, they are considered to be of 
indefinite life and accordingly are not amortised. The Company also considers that there has been no 
impairment of the value of these rights to date. The recoverable amount of these rights has been 
determined on a value-in-use basis, using discounted cash-flow projections for a twenty-year period for 
each route that has an individual landing right. The calculation of value-in-use is most sensitive to the 
operating margin and discount rate assumptions. Operating margins are based on the existing margins 
generated from these routes and adjusted for any known trading conditions. The trading environment is 
subject to both regulatory and competitive pressures that can have a material effect on the operating 
performance of the business. Foreseeable events, however, are unlikely to result in a change of 
projections of a significant nature so as to result in the landing rights' carrying amounts exceeding 
their recoverable amounts. These projections have been discounted using weighted average cost of capital, 
estimated to be 7.7% for 2012, 7.3% for 2011 and 6.1% for 2010.

 ======  ======  ======
As at March 31, 2012 Ryanair's total holding in Aer Lingus was 29.8% (2011: 29.8%; 2010: 29.8%). The balance 
sheet value of EUR149.7 million (2011: EUR114.0 million; 2010: EUR116.2 million) reflects the market value of this 
investment as at March 31, 2012. In accordance with the Company's accounting policy, this asset is held at fair 
value with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income following initial acquisition. All impairment 
losses are recognised in the income statement and any cumulative loss previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement once an impairment is considered to have occurred.

Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of their size and incidence, 
in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we believe this presentation represents the underlying 
business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typicallyanalyse the results. Any 
amounts deemed "exceptional" for management discussion and analysis purposes, in the Chairman's Report and 
Chief Executive's Report, have been classified for the purposes of the income statement in the same way as 
non-exceptional amounts of the same nature.
 Exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2012 relates to a one-off release of ticket sales revenue 
of EUR57.8 million, net of tax, due to a change in accounting estimates relating to the timing of revenue 
recognition for unused passenger tickets which were made as a result of the availability of more accurate 
and timely data obtained through system enhancements. Exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2011 
amounted to EUR26.1 million reflecting the estimated costs relating to the closure of airspace in April 
and May 2010 due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions.
 Adjusted profit after tax excluding exceptional items increased by 25% to EUR502.6 million compared to 
adjusted profit after tax in the year ended March 31, 2011. Including exceptional items the profit after 
tax for the year increased by 50% to EUR560.4 million compared to a profit of EUR374.6 million in the year 
ended March 31, 2011.
 Summary year ended March 31, 2012
 Adjusted profit after tax increased by 25% to EUR502.6 million compared to EUR400.7 million in the year 
ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to a 16% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, 
offset by a 30% increase in fuel costs. Total operating revenues increased by 19% to EUR4,324.9 million as 
average fares rose by 16%. Ancillary revenues grew by 11%, faster than the 5% increase in passenger 
numbers, to EUR886.2 million due to an improved product mix and higher internet related revenues. Total 
revenue per passenger, as a result, increased by 13%, whilst Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 82% 
during the year.
 Total operating expenses increased by 19% to EUR3,707.0 million, primarily due to an increase in fuel 
prices, the higher level of activity and operating costs associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, 
which represents 43% of total operating costs compared to 39% in the prior year, increased by 30% to 
EUR1,593.6 million due to the higher price per gallon paid and an 11% increase in the number of hours 
flown. Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 6% and sector length adjusted, they remained flat.  
Including fuel, unit costs rose by 13%.   Operating margin remained flat at 14% whilst operating profit 
increased by 20% to EUR617.9 million.
 Adjusted net margin was up one point to 12% compared to March 31, 2011.
 Adjusted earnings per share for the year were 34.10 euro cent compared to adjusted basic earnings per 
share of 26.97 euro cent at March 31, 2011.

 Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ryanair Holdings plc
 We have audited the consolidated and Company financial statements ("financial statements") of Ryanair 
Holdings plc for the year ended March 31, 2012, which comprise the consolidated and Company balance 
sheets, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and Company statements of changes in shareholders' equity, the consolidated and Company 
statements of cash flows and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein.
 This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Section 193 of the 
Companies Act, 1990 and in respect of the separate opinion in relation to International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), on terms 
that have been agreed. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and in respect of the separate 
opinion in relation to IFRSs, as issued by the IASB, those matters that we have agreed to state to them in 
our report, and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
 Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
 The directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union (EU), and their separate 
responsibilities for electing to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as 
issued by the IASB, are set out in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities on pages 28 to 29.
 Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (United Kingdom and Ireland).
 We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as issued by the IASB and, have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012 and, in the case of the consolidated financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
 We also report to you, in our opinion; whether proper books of account have been kept by the Company; 
whether at the balance sheet date, there exists a financial situation requiring the convening of an 
extraordinary general meeting of the Company under Section 40(1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983; 
and whether the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the financial statements.  
In addition, we state whether we have obtained all the information and explanations necessary for the 
purposes of our audit, and whether the Company balance sheet is in agreement with the books of account.
 We also report to you if, in our opinion, any information specified by law or the Listing Rules of the 
Irish Stock Exchange regarding directors' remuneration and transactions is not disclosed and, where 
practicable, include such information in our report.
 We are required by law to report to you our opinion as to whether the description of the main features of 
the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the process for preparing the consolidated 
group financial statements, set out in the annual Corporate Governance Statement is consistent with the 
consolidated financial statements. In addition, we review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reflects the Company's compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and two 
provisions of the Irish Corporate Governance annex specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the 
Irish Stock Exchange, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board's 
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the Company's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
 We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with 
the audited financial statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman's and Chief 
Executive's Reports; the Corporate Governance Report; the Operating and Financial Review; Principle Risks 
and Uncertainties; Critical Accounting Policies; Directors, Senior Management and Employees; Major 
Shareholders and Related Party Transactions; and the Directors' Report. We consider the implications for 
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
 Basis of audit opinion
 We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (United Kingdom and 
Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of 
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  It also includes an 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -10-
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the 
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's and Company's 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
 We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we 
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or 
error.  In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information 
in the financial statements.
 Opinion
 In our opinion:
 --    the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group's affairs as at March 31, 2012 and of its profit for the year 
then ended;
 --    the Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012 of the state of 
the Company's affairs as at March 31, 2012;
 --    the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Acts, 1963 to 2012 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and

1963 to 2012.

 In April 2009, Ryanair signed a contract with Webloyalty International Ltd, which offers Ryanair's customers who 
have a UK, German or French billing address a retail discount and cash-back program. In February 2009, Ryanair 
introduced Google Adsense to its search results pages in order to monetize the traffic levels that those pages 
generate. In March 2009, Ryanair expanded further into the area of third-party Internet advertising with the 
introduction of third-party display advertising on the homepages on its website and, more recently, on the subpages 
of Ryanair.com. In April 2011, Ryanair began to sell advertising on its boarding cards. In 2012, a boarding card 
redesign along with increased passengers is expected to provide further growth in this area.
 Ryanair has entered into agreements pursuant to which the Company promotes Ryanair-branded credit and 
prepaid cards issued by MBNA, GE Money, Access Prepaid (a Mastercard company) and Banco Santander on its 
Internet site. The MBNA agreement relates to Irish residents only, the GE Money agreement relates to Swedish and 
Polish residents only and the Banco Santander agreement relates to UK residents only. Ryanair generates revenue 
from MBNA, GE Capital and Banco Santander on the basis of the number of cards issued and the revenues 
generated through the use of the credit cards. The Access Prepaid Limited prepaid card covers residents in the UK, 
Ireland, Italy, Spain and Germany.
 In fiscal year 2012, Ryanair rolled out handheld Electronic Point of Sale ("EPOS") devices across its route network. 
These EPOS devices replaced manual and paper based systems on board the aircraft. The EPOS device enables 
cabin crew to sell and record their on-board sales transactions more efficiently and generate vastly improved 
management sales reporting. The EPOS device also issues bus and rail tickets and tickets for tourist attractions.
 In fiscal year 2011, Ryanair began offering reserved seating in twenty-one extra legroom seats on each aircraft for 
a fee on certain routes and this feature was rolled out to all routes in fiscal year 2012.
 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS
 General
 As part of its commitment to safety, Ryanair endeavors to hire qualified maintenance personnel, provide proper 
training to such personnel, and maintain its aircraft in accordance with European industry standards. While Ryanair 
seeks to maintain its fleet in a cost-effective manner, management does not seek to extend Ryanair's low-cost 
operating strategy to the areas of maintenance, training or quality control.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -27-
 Ryanair's quality assurance department deals with oversight of all maintenance activities in accordance with Part 
145. The European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA"), which established Part 145, came into being on September 
28, 2003, through the adoption of Regulation (EC) No. 1592/2002 of the European Parliament, and its standards 
superseded 
the 
previous 
Joint 
Aviation 
Authority 
("JAA") 
requirements. 
See 
"[3/4]Government 
Regulation[3/4]Regulatory Authorities."
 Ryanair is itself an EASA Part 145-approved maintenance contractor and provides its own routine aircraft 
maintenance and repair services. Ryanair also performs certain checks on its aircraft, including pre-flight, daily, and 
transit checks at some of its bases, as well as A-checks at its Dublin, London (Stansted), Glasgow (Prestwick), 
Bremen and Frankfurt (Hahn) facilities. Since December 2003, Ryanair has operated a five-bay hangar facility at its 
base at Glasgow (Prestwick) in Scotland, where both A-checks and C-checks are performed on the fleet of Boeing 
737-800 aircraft. The facility performs up to four C-checks per week, enabling Ryanair to perform all of the heavy 
maintenance that is currently required on its Boeing 737-800 fleet in-house.
 Ryanair opened a five-bay hangar and stores facility at its London (Stansted) airport base in October 2008 to allow 
Ryanair to carry out additional line maintenance on its expanding fleet. This facility also incorporates two flight 
simulator devices with space and provisions for two more, together with a cabin crew trainer and associated training 
rooms. Ryanair has completed the building of a separate training facility adjacent to the hangar to accommodate a 
full size 737NG training aircraft to allow for cabin crew and engineering training. Ryanair carries out checks and line 
maintenance in its single-bay aircraft hangar facility in Bremen. Ryanair has also entered into a 30-year sole-
tenancy agreement with Frankfurt (Hahn) airport and has taken acceptance of a two-bay hangar and stores facility 
that also incorporates a two-bay simulator-training center. This facility was completed in January 2011 and allows 
Ryanair to carry out additional line maintenance including A checks.
 Maintenance and repair services that may become necessary while an aircraft is located at some of the other 
airports served by Ryanair are provided by other Part 145-approved contract maintenance providers. Aircraft return 
each evening to Ryanair's bases, where they are examined by Ryanair's approved engineers or, in the case of 
Brussels (Charleroi), Stockholm (Skavsta), Frankfurt (Hahn), Barcelona (Girona), Madrid, Alicante, Dusseldorf 
(Weeze), Bristol, Paphos and Billund, by local Part 145-approved companies.
 Heavy Maintenance
 As noted above, Ryanair currently has sufficient capacity to be able to carry out all of the routine maintenance work 
required on its Boeing 737-800 fleet itself. Ryanair opened a new three-bay maintenance hangar at Glasgow 
(Prestwick) airport in winter 2010 to accommodate the additional maintenance requirements arising from its 
expanding and aging fleet.
 Ryanair contracts out engine overhaul service for its Boeing 737-800 aircraft to General Electric Engine Services 
pursuant to a 10-year agreement with an option for a 10-year extension, signed in 2004. This comprehensive 
maintenance contract provides for the repair and overhaul of the CFM56-7B series engines fitted to the first 155 of 
Ryanair's Boeing 737-800 aircraft, the repair of parts and general technical support for the fleet of engines. On June 
30, 2008, the Company finalized a contract for a similar level of coverage and support for the engines on all of its 
aircraft that have been or are scheduled to be delivered pursuant to the Company's current contracts with Boeing 
over the period through November 2012. Due to the fact that engines on recently delivered aircraft will not require a 
scheduled engine overhaul prior to the expiry of the current contract with GE, Ryanair has decided, at this time, not 
to take up its option to have engines delivered with aircraft after October 2010 covered by this contract. General 
Electric Engine Services mainly uses its Part 145-approved repair facility in Cardiff, Wales for this work, but also 
uses the KLM Part 145-approved facility in Amsterdam, and occasionally its Part 145-approved facility in Celma, 
Brazil. By contracting with experienced Part 145-approved maintenance providers, management believes it is better 
able to ensure the quality of its aircraft and engine maintenance. Ryanair assigns a Part 145-certified mechanic to 
oversee all heavy maintenance and to authorize all engine overhauls performed by third parties. Maintenance 
providers are also monitored closely by the national authorities under EASA and national regulations.
 Ryanair expects to be dependent on external service contractors, particularly for engine and component 
maintenance, for the foreseeable future, notwithstanding the additional capabilities provided by its maintenance 
facilities at Glasgow (Prestwick), London (Stansted) and Frankfurt (Hahn). See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk 
Factors-Risks Related to the Company-The Company Is Dependent on External Service Providers."
 SAFETY RECORD
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -27-
 Ryanair has not had a single passenger or flight crew fatality in its 27-year operating history. Ryanair demonstrates 
its commitment to safe operations through its safety training procedures, its investment in safety-related equipment, 
and its adoption of an internal confidential reporting system for safety issues. The Company's Board of Directors 
also has an air safety committee to review and discuss air safety and related issues. Michael Horgan, a Company 
director, is the chairman of this committee and reports to the Board of Directors.
 Ryanair's flight training is oriented towards accident prevention and covers all aspects of flight operations. Ryanair 
maintains full control of the content and delivery of all of its flight crew training, including initial, recurrent, and 
upgrade phases. All training programs are approved by the Irish Aviation Authority (the "IAA"), which regularly 
audits both operation control standards and flight crew training standards for compliance with EU legislation.
 All of the Boeing 737-800s that Ryanair has bought or committed to buy are certified for Category IIIA landings 
(automatic landings with minimum horizontal visibility of 200 meters and a 50 feet decision height).
 Ryanair has a comprehensive and documented safety management system. Management encourages flight crews 
to report any safety-related issues through the Safety Alert Initial Report reporting program or to use the confidential 
reporting system, which is available online through Ryanair's Crewdock system. The confidential reporting system 
affords flight crews the opportunity to report directly to Flight Safety Officer any event, error, or discrepancy in flight 
operations that they do not wish to report through standard reporting channels. The confidential reporting system is 
designed to increase management's awareness of problems that may be encountered by flight crews in their day-
to-day operations. Management uses the information reported through all reporting systems to modify operating 
procedures and improve flight operation standards.

11           Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Company utilises financial instruments to reduce exposures to market risks throughout its business. 
Borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments are used to finance the Company's operations. 
Derivative financial instruments are contractual agreements with a value that reflects price movements in 
an underlying asset. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally jet fuel derivatives, 
interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage 
commodity risks, interest rate risks and currency exposures and to achieve the desired profile of fixed 
and variable rate borrowings and leases in appropriate currencies. It is the Company's policy that no 
speculative trading in financial instruments shall take place.
 The main risks attaching to the Company's financial instruments, the Company's strategy and approach to 
managing these risks, and the details of the derivatives employed to hedge against these risks have been 
disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

The plans' assets do not include any of our own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets 
used by us.
 The expected long-term rate of return on assets of 6.15% (2011: 6.75%; 2010: 6.67%) for the Irish scheme was 
calculated based on the assumptions of the following returns for each asset class: Equities 7.50% (2011: 7.50%; 
2010: 7.75%); Bonds 4.50% (2011: 4.50%; 2010: 3.50% ); Property 6.50% (2011: 6.25%; 2010: 6.25%); and Cash 
3.00% (2011: 3.00%; 2010: 2.00%). The expected long-term rate of return on assets of 6.55% (2011: 7.55%; 2010: 
7.45%) for the UK scheme was calculated based on the assumptions of the following returns for each asset class: 
Equities 7.50% (2011: 8.10%; 2010: 8.30%); Corporate and Overseas Bonds 4.65% (2011: 5.60%; 2010: 5.50%); 
and Other 3.00% (2011: 3.00%; 2010: 2.27%).
 Since there are no suitable euro-denominated AA-rated corporate bonds, the expected return is estimated by 
adding a suitable risk premium to the rate available from government bonds. The assumptions are based on long-
term expectations at the beginning of the reporting period and are expected to be relatively stable.
 The history of the plans for the current and prior periods is as follows:

We expect to contribute approximately EUR1.1 million to our defined-benefit plans in 2013.
 Defined-contribution schemes
 The Company operates defined-contribution retirement plans in Ireland and the UK. The costs of these 
plans are charged to the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. The

 Commitments
 In January 2002, the Company entered into a contract with Boeing (the "2002 Boeing contract") whereby the 
Company agreed to purchase 100 new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, and received purchase rights 
to acquire a further 50 such aircraft. The 2002 Boeing contract was superseded by a contract entered into 
with Boeing in January 2003 (the "2003 Boeing contract") whereby the Company agreed to purchase 125 new 
Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, thus adding "firm" orders for 22 aircraft to the existing 
"firm" orders (100 "firm" orders, plus three options exercised) under the 2002 Boeing contract. In 
addition, the Company acquired purchase rights over a further 78 aircraft, bringing the number of option 
aircraft to 125.
 In February 2005, the Company entered into another contract with Boeing (the "2005 Boeing contract") 
whereby the Company agreed to purchase 70 new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft and acquired 
additional purchase rights to acquire a further 70 such aircraft over a five-year period from 2006 to 2012 
(subsequently extended to 2013). The aircraft to be delivered after January 1, 2005, arising from the 2002 
and 2003 Boeing contracts, benefit from the discounts and concessions under the 2005 Boeing contract. In 
addition, the orders for the 89 "firm" aircraft still to be delivered at January 1, 2005 and the remaining 
additional purchase rights in respect of 123 aircraft granted under the 2002 and 2003 Boeing contracts are 
governed by the 2005 Boeing contract from January 2005.
 In August 2006 the Company exercised 32 options under the 2005 contract whereby it increased its "firm" 
aircraft deliveries by this amount during fiscal 2009 (22) and 2010 (10).
 In April 2007 the Company exercised 27 options under the 2005 contract whereby it increased its "firm" 
aircraft deliveries during fiscal 2010.
 In June 2008, the Company exercised three options with Boeing under the terms of its 2005 contract. These 
"firm" Boeing 737-800 aircraft were delivered in fiscal 2011.
 In September 2008, the Company exercised four options with Boeing under the terms of its 2005 contract. 
These "firm" Boeing 737-800 aircraft were delivered in fiscal 2011.
 In October 2008, the Company exercised 10 options with Boeing under the terms of its 2005 contract. These 
"firm" Boeing 737-800 aircraft were delivered in fiscal 2011.
 In January 2009, the Company exercised 13 options with Boeing under the terms of its 2005 contract. These 
"firm" Boeing 737-800 aircraft were delivered in fiscal 2011.
 In December 2009, the Company exercised 10 options with Boeing under the terms of its 2005 contract. 
These "firm" Boeing 737-800 aircraft will be delivered in fiscal 2013.

deferred tax has been provided for on the un-remitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries because there is 
no intention to remit these to Ireland.

 Ryanair's revenue passenger miles ("RPMs") increased approximately 10% from 53,256.9 million in the 2011 fiscal 
year to 58,584.5 million in the 2012 fiscal year due primarily to an increase of approximately 12% in scheduled 
available seat miles ("ASMs") from 63,358.3 million in the 2011 fiscal year to 71,139.7 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year. Scheduled passenger revenues increased approximately 24% from EUR2,827.9 million in the 2011 fiscal year 
to EUR3,504.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year. Average yield per RPM was EUR0.053 in the 2011 fiscal year and 
EUR0.059 in the 2012 fiscal year.
 Expanding passenger volumes and capacity, high load factors and aggressive cost containment have enabled 
Ryanair to continue to generate operating profits despite increasing price competition and increases in certain 
costs. Ryanair's total break-even load factor was 72% in the 2011 fiscal year and 71% in the 2012 fiscal year. Cost 
per ASM was EUR0.049 in the 2011 fiscal year and EUR0.051 in the 2012 fiscal year, with the increase primarily 
reflecting the higher fuel cost per ASM of EUR0.022 in the 2012 fiscal year, as compared to EUR0.019 in the 2011 
fiscal year, as well as an increase of approximately 12% in ASMs in the 2012 fiscal year. Ryanair recorded 
operating profits of EUR488.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year and EUR683.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year. The 
Company recorded a profit after taxation of EUR374.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year and profit after taxation of 
EUR560.4 million in the 2012 fiscal year. Ryanair recorded seat capacity growth of approximately 6% in the 2012 
fiscal year, compared to approximately 8% in the 2011 fiscal year, and expects capacity to increase by 
approximately 4% in the 2013 fiscal year. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Ryanair Has Decided to 
Seasonally Ground Aircraft."
 Investment in Aer Lingus
 The Company owns 29.8% of Aer Lingus, which it acquired in fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009 at a total cost of 
EUR407.2 million. Following the approval of its shareholders, management proposed in the 2007 fiscal year to 
effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by 
the European Commission on competition grounds in June 2007. Ryanair's management viewed the acquisition of 
Aer Lingus in the context of the overall trend of consolidation among airlines in Europe and believed that the 
acquisition would lead to the formation of one strong Irish airline group able to compete with large carriers such as 
Lufthansa, Air France/KLM and British Airways/Iberia (now "International Airlines Group"). During the EU 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -34-
competition review, the Company made a commitment that if the acquisition was approved, Ryanair would eliminate 
Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges and reduce its fares, which would have resulted in Aer Lingus passengers saving 
approximately EUR100 million per year. The Company was thus surprised and disappointed by the European 
Commission's decision to prohibit this offer. This decision was the first adverse decision taken in respect of any EU 
airline merger and the first-ever adverse decision in respect of a proposed merger of two companies with less than 
5% of the EU market for their services. Ryanair filed an appeal with the CFI, which was heard in July 2009. On July 
6, 2010, the CFI upheld the Commission's decision.
 In October 2007, the European Commission also reached a formal decision that it would not force Ryanair to sell 
its shares in Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus appealed this decision before the CFI. This case was heard in July 2009 and 
on July 6, 2010 the court rejected Aer Lingus' appeal and confirmed that Ryanair cannot be forced to dispose of its 
29.8% stake in Aer Lingus. However, EU legislation may change in the future to require such a forced disposition. If 
eventually forced to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus, Ryanair could suffer significant losses due to the negative 
impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares.
 On December 1, 2008, Ryanair made a new offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not own 
at a price of EUR1.40 per ordinary share. Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain the 
Aer Lingus brand, and retain its Heathrow slots and connectivity. Ryanair also proposed to double Aer Lingus' 
short-haul fleet from 33 to 66 aircraft and to create 1,000 associated new jobs over a five-year period. If the offer 
had been accepted, the Irish government would have received over EUR180 million in cash. The employee share 
ownership trust and employees, who owned 18% of Aer Lingus, would have received over EUR137 million in cash. 
The Company met Aer Lingus management, representatives of the employee share ownership trust and other 
parties, including members of the Irish Government. The offer of EUR1.40 per share represented a premium of 
approximately 25% over the closing price of EUR1.12 for Aer Lingus shares on November 28, 2008. As the 
Company was unable to secure the shareholders' support, it decided on January 28, 2009 to withdraw its offer for 
Aer Lingus.
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it intended 
to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected on the basis that the OFT's investigation was 
time-barred. Ryanair maintains that the OFT had the opportunity, which it missed, to investigate Ryanair's minority 
stake within four months from the European Commission's June 2007 decision to prohibit Ryanair's takeover of Aer 
Lingus. The OFT agreed in October 2010 to suspend its investigation pending the outcome of Ryanair's appeal 
against the OFT's decision that its investigation is within time. On July 28, 2011, the Competition Appeal Tribunal 
ruled that the OFT was not time barred when it attempted in September 2010 to open an investigation into 
Ryanair's 2006 acquisition of a minority non-controlling stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair subsequently appealed the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal's decision.  On November 24, 2011, the UK Court of Appeal ordered a stay of the 
OFT's investigation pending the Courts review of whether the OFT's investigation was time barred.  On May 22, 
2012, the Court of Appeal found that the OFT was not time barred to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer 
Lingus in September 2010.  Ryanair subsequently sought permission to appeal that ruling to the UK Supreme 
Court, but permission was refused. On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's minority stake 
in Aer Lingus to the UK Competition Commission. Ryanair welcomed the decision by the OFT to refer the case to 
the Competition Commission and Ryanair anticipates that the Competition Commission will agree with the decision 
of the European Commission in 2007 that since Ryanair has neither "de factor or de jure control" in Aer Lingus, that 
it should not be forced to sell down its minority stake.  The Competition Commission could order Ryanair to divest 
some or all of its shares in Aer Lingus, as a result of which Ryanair could suffer significant losses due to the 
negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares.
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair made a third offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not own at a 
price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share.  The timing of the offer has been influenced by: (1) the continued 
consolidation of European airlines, and more recently the International Airlines Group (the parent company of 
British Airways) takeover of British Midland International, where the No. 1 airline at Heathrow was allowed to 
acquire the No. 2; (2) the additional capacity available at Dublin airport following the opening of Terminal 2 and the 
decline in traffic from 23.3 million passengers per annum in 2007 to 18.7 million in 2011, has resulted in Dublin 
airport operating at approximately 50% capacity; (3) the change in the Irish government policy since 2006 in that the 
Irish government has decided to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (4) the fact that under the terms of the bailout 
agreement provided by the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund to 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -34-
Ireland, the Irish government has committed to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (5) the fact that the ESOT (Employee 
Share Ownership Trust) which at the time of the unsuccessful 2006 offer controlled 15% of Aer Lingus, has been 
disbanded since December 2010 and the shares distributed to the individual members, with the result that Ryanair's 
new offer is, in Ryanair's view, capable of reaching over 50% acceptance either with or without government 
acceptance; and (6) the fact that recently Etihad, an Abu Dhabi based airline, has acquired a 3% stake in Aer 
Lingus and has expressed an interest in buying the government's 25% stake in Aer Lingus (the offer now provides 
Etihad or any other potential bidder the opportunity to purchase the government's stake). Ryanair is willing to offer 
the European Commission appropriate remedies to allay competition concerns and it believes that these remedies, 
as well as the efficiencies and synergies arising from the combination, should allow the Commission to approve this 
proposed merger.

 ======  ======  =========
As at March 31, 2012, a deferred tax asset of EUR5 million was recognised in respect of net operating losses 
incurred and available to carry forward to future periods (2011: EUR31.4 million, 2010: EUR29.5 million). The 
recoverability of the deferred tax asset is based on future income forecasts which demonstrate that it is more likely 
than not that future profits will be available in order to utilise the deferred tax asset. The deferred tax asset's 
recoverability is not dependent on material improvements over historical levels of pre-tax income, material changes 
in the present relationship between income reported for financial and tax purposes, or material asset sales or other 
non-routine transactions.
 New temporary differences arising in the year to March 31, 2012 consisted of temporary differences of a charge of 
EUR41.4 million for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income statement, a credit of EUR15.2 million 
for derivatives and a credit of EUR0.9 million for pensions, all recognised in other comprehensive income. The 
charge in the year to March 31, 2011 consisted of temporary differences of a charge of EUR43.7 million for 
property, plant and equipment recognised in the income statement, a charge of EUR25.6 million for derivatives and 
a charge of EUR0.7 million for pensions, all recognised in other comprehensive income. The charge in the year to 
March 31, 2010 consisted of temporary differences of a charge of EUR30.2 million for property, plant and 
equipment recognised in the income statement and a charge of EUR9.0 million for derivatives, all recognised in 
other comprehensive income.

Body
 The Company engages in equity-settled, share-based payment transactions in respect of services received 
from certain of its employees. The fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the 
fair value of the share options on the date of the grant. The grant measurement date is the date that a 
shared understanding of the terms of the award is established between the Company and the employee. The 
cost of the employee services received in respect of the share options granted is recognised in the income 
statement over the period that the services are received, which is the vesting period, with a 
corresponding increase in equity. To the extent that service is provided prior to the grant measurement 
date, the fair value of the share options is initially estimated and re-measured at each balance sheet 
date until the grant measurement date is achieved. The fair value of the options granted is determined 
using a binomial lattice option-pricing model, which takes into account the exercise price of the option, 
the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the Ryanair Holdings plc 
share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. Non-market vesting conditions are 
taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the 
cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount recognised in the income statement reflects the 
number of vested shares or share options.
 Pensions and other post-retirement obligations
 The Company provides certain employees with post-retirement benefits in the form of pensions. The Company 
operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
 Costs arising in respect of the Company's defined contribution pension schemes (where fixed contributions 
are paid into the scheme and there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts) are 
charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Any contributions unpaid at the 
balance sheet date are included as a liability.
 A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined-contribution plan. The 
liabilities and costs associated with the Company's defined benefit pension schemes are assessed on the 
basis of the projected unit credit method by professionally qualified actuaries and are arrived at using 
actuarial assumptions based on market expectations at the balance sheet date. The discount rates employed 
in determining the present value of each scheme's liabilities are determined by reference to market yields 
at the balance sheet date of high quality corporate bonds in the same currency and term that is consistent 
with those of the associated pension obligations. The net surplus or deficit arising on the Company's 
defined-benefit schemes is shown within non-current assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. The 
deferred tax impact of any such amount is disclosed separately within deferred tax.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -67-
 The Company separately recognises the operating and financing costs of defined-benefit pensions in the 
income statement. IFRS permits a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses. The 
Company has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses within other comprehensive income.
 Income taxes including deferred income taxes
 Income tax on the profit or loss for a year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised 
in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive 
income (such as certain hedging derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale assets, pensions and 
other post-retirement obligations). Current tax payable on taxable profits is recognised as an expense in 
the period in which the profits arise using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
 Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary 
differences arising from the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying accounts in the 
consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and legislation 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and expected to apply when the temporary 
differences reverse.
 The following temporary differences are not provided for: (i) the initial recognition of assets and 
liabilities that effect neither accounting nor taxable profit and (ii) differences relating to investments 
in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable they will not reverse in the future.
 A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets 
are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that a 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be realised.
 Share capital
 Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of 
ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. When 
share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, which includes any 
directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased 
shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity, until they 
are cancelled.
 Prospective accounting changes, new standards and interpretations not yet adopted
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. We do not anticipate that the adoption of 
these new or revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations, except for IFRS 9, which may impact the classification and measurement of some 
of the Company's financial instruments. The Company does not currently plan to early adopt this standard. 
The impact of this standard will be considered when all elements of the final IFRS have been issued.

 The Company accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS 19, "Employee Benefits."
 The Company operates defined-benefit and defined-contribution schemes.
 Defined-benefit schemes
 The Company funds the pension entitlements of certain employees through defined-benefit plans. Two plans are 
operated for eligible Irish and UK employees. In general, on retirement, a member is entitled to a pension calculated 
at 1/60th of the final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years. 
These plans are fully funded on a discontinuance basis and the related pension costs and liabilities are assessed in 
accordance with the advice of a professionally qualified actuary. The investments of the plans at March 31, 2012 
consisted of units held in independently administered funds. The most recent full actuarial valuations of the plans 
were carried out at January 1, 2011 in respect of the UK plan and December 31, 2009 in respect of the Irish plan, in 
accordance with local regulatory requirements using the projected unit credit method, and the valuation reports are 
not available for public inspection.
 A separate annual actuarial valuation has been performed for the purposes of preparing these financial statements. 
The principal actuarial assumptions used for the purpose of this actuarial valuation were as follows:

The Company uses certain mortality rate assumptions when calculating scheme liabilities. The mortality 
assumptions of the Irish scheme have been based on the mortality table 62%/70% PNM/FL00 while the mortality 
assumptions of the UK scheme have been based on the "SAPS" mortality table. Both mortality assumptions make 
allowance for future improvements in mortality rates. Retirement ages for scheme members are 60 for pilots and 65 
for other staff.
 The current life expectancies underlying the value of the scheme liabilities for the Irish scheme are as follows:

(a)    Additional information in relation to the above interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts 
(i.e. notional value and weighted average interest rates) can be found in Note 11 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
 (b)   EUR26.7 million interest rate swap financial liabilities falling due within one year, includes 
EUR2.1 million derivative financial liabilities, falling due within one year, in respect of cross currency 
interest rate swaps (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
 (c)    EUR144.3 million commodity forward contracts falling due within one year, includes EUR145.8 
million jet fuel derivative financial assets and EUR1.5 million carbon swap financial liability (see Note 
11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements).
 Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert a portion of the Company's floating rate exposures on 
borrowings and operating leases into fixed rate exposures and are set so as to match exactly the critical 
terms of the underlying debt or lease being hedged (i.e. notional principal, interest rate settings, re-
pricing dates). These are all classified as cash-flow hedges of the forecasted variable interest payments 
and rentals due on the Company's underlying debt and operating leases and have been determined to be 
highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows. Accordingly, no ineffectiveness has been recorded in 
the income statement relating to these hedges in the current and preceding years.
 The Company also utilises cross currency interest rate swaps to manage exposures to fluctuations in 
foreign exchange rates of US dollar denominated floating rate borrowings, together with managing the 
exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on these US dollar denominated floating rate borrowings. Cross 
currency interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert a portion of the Company's US dollar 
denominated debt to euro and floating rate interest exposures into fixed rate exposures and are set so as 
to match exactly the critical terms of the underlying debt being hedged (i.e. notional principal, interest 
rate settings, re-pricing dates). These are all classified as cash-flow hedges of the forecasted US dollar 
variable interest payments on the Company's underlying debt and have been determined to be highly 
effective in achieving offsetting cash flows. Accordingly, no ineffectiveness has been recorded in the 
income statement relating to these hedges in the current year.

 (b)           Icelandic volcanic ash related costs of EUR26.1 million reflect the estimated costs 
relating to the closure of airspace in April and May 2010 due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions. 
The closure of European airspace in April and May 2010, due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruption, 
resulted in the cancellation of 9,400 Ryanair flights. The impact on the Group's operating results totaled 
EUR29.7 million, (before associated tax of EUR3.6 million) for the year ended March 31, 2011, comprising 
EUR15.6 million of operating expenses and EUR1.7 million of finance expenses attributable to the period of 
flight disruption, together with estimated passenger compensation costs of EUR12.4 million pursuant to 
Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 ('EU261'). The Company's estimate of total passenger compensation costs has 
been determined based on actual claims received and processed to date together with probable future 
compensation payments and other related costs.
 (c)           This reflects the impairment change taken on the Company's investment in Aer Lingus in 
2010.

 ===========  ===========  ===========
Non-flight scheduled revenue arises from the sale of rail and bus tickets, hotel reservations, car hire 
and other sources, including excess baggage charges and administration fees, all directly attributable to 
the low-fares business.
 All of the Company's operating profit arises from low-fares airline-related activities, its only business 
segment. The major revenue earning assets of the Company are its aircraft, which are registered in Ireland 
and therefore all profits accrue principally in Ireland. Since the Company's aircraft fleet is flexibly 
employed across its route network in Europe, there is no suitable basis of allocating such assets and 
related liabilities to geographical segments.

Interest rate re-pricing
 Floating interest rates on financial liabilities are generally referenced to European inter-bank interest rates 
(EURIBOR). Secured long-term debt and interest rate swaps typically re-price on a quarterly basis with finance 
leases re-pricing on a semi-annual basis. We use current interest rate settings on existing floating rate debt at each 
year-end to calculate contractual cash flows.
 Fixed interest rates on financial liabilities are fixed for the duration of the underlying structures (typically between 
10 and 12 years).
 The Company holds significant cash balances that are invested on a short-term basis. At March 31, 2012, all of the 
Company's cash and liquid resources had a maturity of one year or less and attracted a weighted average interest 
rate of 1.07% (2011: 0.97%; 2010: 0.93%).

Interest rates on cash and liquid resources are generally based on the appropriate EURIBOR, LIBOR or bank 
rates dependant on the principal amounts on deposit.
 As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company also held EUR149.7 million 
of an equity investment in Aer Lingus at March 31, 2012 (2011: EUR114.0 million; 2010: EUR116.2 million). 
This has no fixed maturity and is not interest bearing.
 (d)           Foreign currency risk
 The Company has exposure to various foreign currencies (principally U.K. pounds sterling and U.S. 
dollars) due to the international nature of its operations. The Company manages this risk by matching U.K. 
pound sterling revenues against U.K. pound sterling costs. Any remaining unmatched U.K. pound sterling 
revenues are used to fund U.S. dollar currency exposures that arise in relation to fuel, maintenance, 
aviation insurance and capital expenditure costs or are sold for euro. The Company also sells euro forward 
to cover certain U.S. dollar costs. Further details of the hedging activity carried out by the Company are 
disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
 The following table shows the net amount of monetary assets of the Company that are not denominated in 
euro at March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Such amounts have been translated using the following year-end 
foreign currency rates in 2012: EUR/GBP: 0.8339 ; EUR/$: 1.3356 (2011: EUR/GBP: 0.8837; EUR/$: 1.4207, 
2010: EUR/GBP: 0.8898; EUR/$: 1.3479).

Body
 Foreign currency forward contracts are utilised in a number of ways: forecast U.K. pounds sterling and euro 
revenue receipts are converted into U.S. dollars to hedge against forecasted U.S. dollar payments principally for jet 
fuel, insurance, capital expenditure and other aircraft related costs. These are classified as either cash-flow or fair-
value hedges of forecasted and committed U.S. dollar payments and have been determined to be highly effective in 
offsetting variability in future cash flows and fair values arising from the fluctuation in the U.S. dollar to pounds 
sterling and euro exchange rates for the forecast and committed U.S. dollar purchases. Because the timing of 
anticipated payments and the settlement of the related derivatives is very closely coordinated, no ineffectiveness 
has been recorded for these foreign currency forward contracts in the current or preceding years (the underlying 
hedged items and hedging instruments have been consistently closely matched).
 The Company also utilises jet fuel forward contracts to manage exposure to jet fuel prices. These are used to 
hedge the Company's forecasted fuel purchases, and are arranged so as to match as closely as possible against 
forecasted fuel delivery and payment requirements. These are classified as cash-flow hedges of forecasted fuel 
payments and have been determined to be highly effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from 
fluctuations in jet fuel prices. No ineffectiveness has been recorded on these arrangements in the current or 
preceding years.
 The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) began operating for airlines on 1 January 2012. In order 
to manage the risks associated with the fluctuation in the price of carbon emission credits, the Company entered 
into swap arrangements to fix the cost of a portion of their forecasted carbon emission credit purchases. The 
Company can forecast its requirement for carbon credits as they are directly linked to its consumption of jet fuel. 
These instruments have been classified as cash-flow hedges and no ineffectiveness has been recorded in the 
current year.
 The (gains)/losses on the aircraft firm commitments are recognised as part of the capitalised cost of aircraft 
additions, within property, plant and equipment. The (gains)/losses on interest rate swaps, commodity forward 
contracts and forward currency contracts (excluding aircraft firm commitments) are recognised in the income 
statement when the hedged transaction occurs.

The Company has accounted for its share option grants to employees at fair value, in accordance with IFRS 
2, using a binomial lattice model to value the option grants. The net credit to the income statement of 
EUR0.7 million (2011: EUR3.3 million charge; 2010: EUR4.9 million charge) comprises a EUR2.5 million 
reversal of previously recognised share-based compensation expense for awards that did not vest, offset by 
a charge of EUR1.8 million for the fair value of various share options granted in prior periods, which are 
recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.  This was based on 
8.4 million share options within the scope of IFRS 2 (2011: 22.6 million; 2010: 23.2 million) as compared 
to the total share options disclosed above (as permitted by the transitional rules in IFRS 1).
 There were no share options granted during the years ended March 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012.
 16     Other equity reserve
 The total share based payments reserve at March 31, 2012 was EUR21.6 million (2011: EUR25.3 million; 
2010: EUR26.5 million). The available-for-sale financial asset reserve at March 31, 2012 was EUR70.0 
million (2011: EUR34.3 million; 2010: EUR36.5 million). The total cash-flow hedge reserve amounted to 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -83-
EUR138.6 million at March 31, 2012 (2011: EUR257.4 million; 2010: EUR60.3 million). Further details of the 
group's derivatives are set out in Notes 5 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
 17     Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related services, 
including scheduled services, internet and other related services to third parties across a European route 
network. The Company operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route 
scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to Michael O'Leary, CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). When making 
resource allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than results on individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated adjusted profit/(loss) after 
tax of the Company for the year. This measure excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, 
which are unusual, by virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core 
operations, such as the impairment of a financial asset investment, accelerated depreciation related to 
aircraft disposals and Icelandic volcanic ash related costs.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and, as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, inter-segment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset class comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly 
employed across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable 
segment operations.   In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets 
and liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
 There have been no changes to the basis of segmentation or the measurement basis for the segment profit 
or loss since the prior year.
 Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

Committee can exercise the powers exercisable by the full Board of Directors in circumstances in which action by 
the Board of Directors is required but it is impracticable to convene a meeting of the full Board of Directors. Messrs. 
Bonderman, McLaughlin, O'Leary and Osborne are the members of the Executive Committee.
 Remuneration Committee. The Board of Directors established the Remuneration Committee in September 1996. 
This committee has authority to determine the remuneration of senior executives of the Company and to administer 
the stock option plans described below. The Board of Directors as a whole determines the remuneration and 
bonuses of the chief executive officer, who is the only executive director. Messrs. Osborne, Pietrogrande and 
Kirchberger are the members of the Remuneration Committee.
 Audit Committee. The Board of Directors established the Audit Committee in September 1996 to make 
recommendations concerning the engagement of independent chartered accountants; to review with the 
accountants the plans for and scope of each annual audit, the audit procedures to be utilized and the results of the 
audit; to approve the professional services provided by the accountants; to review the independence of the 
accountants; and to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's internal accounting controls. Messrs. 
McKeon, Osborne and McCreevy are the members of the Audit Committee. In accordance with the 
recommendations of the Irish Combined Code of Corporate Governance (the "Combined Code"), a senior 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -44-
independent non-executive director, Mr. McKeon, is the chairman of the Audit Committee. All members of the Audit 
Committee are independent for purposes of the listing rules of the NASDAQ and the U.S. federal securities laws.
 Nomination Committee. The Board of Directors established the Nomination Committee in May 1999 to make 
recommendations and proposals to the full Board of Directors concerning the selection of individuals to serve as 
executive and non-executive directors. The Board of Directors as a whole then makes appropriate determinations 
regarding such matters after considering such recommendations and proposals. Messrs. Bonderman, McLaughlin 
and O'Leary are the members of the Nomination Committee.
 Air Safety Committee. The Board of Directors established the Air Safety Committee in March 1997 to review and 
discuss air safety and related issues. The Air Safety Committee reports to the full Board of Directors each quarter. 
The Air Safety Committee is composed of Mr. Horgan (who acts as the chairman), as well as the following 
executive officers of Ryanair: Messrs. Conway, Hickey, O'Brien and Wilson.
 Powers of, and Action by, the Board of Directors
 The Board of Directors is empowered by the Articles to carry on the business of Ryanair Holdings, subject to the 
Articles, provisions of general law and the right of stockholders to give directions to the directors by way of ordinary 
resolutions. Every director who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors of Ryanair Holdings has one vote. 
In the case of a tie on a vote, the chairman of the Board of Directors has a second or tie-breaking vote. A director 
may designate an alternate director to attend any Board of Directors meeting, and such alternate director shall have 
all the rights of a director at such meeting.
 The quorum for a meeting of the Board of Directors, unless another number is fixed by the directors, consists of 
three directors, a majority of whom must be EU nationals. The Articles require the vote of a majority of the directors 
(or alternates) present at a duly convened meeting for the approval of any action by the Board of Directors.
 Composition and Term of Office
 The Articles provide that the Board of Directors shall consist of no fewer than three and no more than 15 directors, 
unless otherwise determined by the stockholders. There is no maximum age for a director and no director is 
required to own any shares of Ryanair Holdings.
 Directors are elected (or have their appointments confirmed) at the annual general meetings of stockholders. Save 
in certain circumstances, at every annual general meeting, one-third (rounded down to the next whole number if it is 
a fractional number) of the directors (being the directors who have been longest in office) must stand for re-election 
as their terms expire. Accordingly the terms of Michael Horgan, Kyran McLoughlin and Paolo Pietrogrande will have 
expired. Michael Horgan and Kyran McLoughlin will be eligible to offer themselves for re-election at the annual 
general meeting scheduled to be held on September 21, 2012. Paolo Pietrogrande will not be offering himself for 
re-election.
 Exemptions from NASDAQ Corporate Governance Rules
 The Company relies on certain exemptions from the NASDAQ corporate governance rules. These exemptions, and 
the practices the Company adheres to, are as follows:
 The Company is exempt from NASDAQ's quorum requirements applicable to meetings of shareholders, which 
require a minimum quorum of 33% for any meeting of the holders of common stock, which in the Company's case 
are its Ordinary Shares. In keeping with Irish generally accepted business practice, the Articles provide for a 
quorum for general meetings of shareholders of three shareholders, regardless of the level of their aggregate share 
ownership.
 The Company is exempt from NASDAQ's requirement with respect to audit committee approval of related-party 
transactions, as well as its requirement that shareholders approve certain stock or asset purchases when a director, 
officer or substantial shareholder has an interest. The Company is subject to extensive provisions under the Listing 
Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange (the "Irish Listing Rules") governing transactions with related parties, as defined 
therein, and the Irish Companies Act also restricts the extent to which Irish companies may enter into related-party 
transactions. In addition, the Articles contain provisions regarding disclosure of interests by the directors and 
restrictions on their votes in circumstances involving conflicts of interest. The concept of a related party for 
purposes of NASDAQ's audit committee and shareholder approval rules differs in certain respects from the 
definition of a transaction with a related party under the Irish Listing Rules.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -44-
 NASDAQ requires shareholder approval for certain transactions involving the sale or issuance by a listed company 
of common stock other than in a public offering. Under the NASDAQ rules, whether shareholder approval is 
required for such transactions depends, among other things, on the number of shares to be issued or sold in 
connection with a transaction, while the Irish Listing Rules require shareholder approval when the size of a 
transaction exceeds a certain percentage of the size of the listed company undertaking the transaction.
 NASDAQ requires that each issuer solicit proxies and provide proxy statements for all meetings of shareholders 
and provide copies of such proxy solicitation to NASDAQ. The Company is exempt from this requirement as the 
solicitation of holders of ADSs is not required under the Irish Listing Rules or the Irish Companies Acts. Details of 
our annual general meetings and other shareholder meetings, together with the requirements for admission, voting 
or the appointment of a proxy are available on the website of the Company in accordance with the Irish Companies 
Acts and the Company's Articles of Association. ADS holders may provide instructions to The Bank of New York, as 
depositary, as to the voting of the underlying Ordinary Shares represented by such ADSs. Alternatively, ADS 
holders may convert their holding to Ordinary Shares, subject to compliance with the nationality ownership rules, in 
order to be eligible to attend our annual general meetings or other shareholder meetings.
 The Company also follows certain other practices under the UK Corporate Governance Code in lieu of those set 
forth in the NASDAQ corporate governance rules, as expressly permitted thereby. Most significantly:

(e)           Equity risk
 The Company has exposure to equity price risk primarily in relation to its 29.8% investment in Aer 
Lingus. The Company does not have significant influence over Aer Lingus and accordingly, this investment 
is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset rather than an investment in an associate. 
Additional information in relation to the available-for-sale financial asset can be found in Note 4 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
 (f)            Credit risk
 The Company holds significant cash balances, which are invested on a short-term basis and are classified 
as either cash equivalents or liquid investments. These deposits and other financial instruments 
(principally certain derivatives and loans as identified above) give rise to credit risk on amounts due 
from counterparties. Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -79-
any one counterparty through regular review of counterparties' market-based ratings, Tier 1 capital level 
and credit default swap rates and by taking into account bank counterparties' systemic importance to the 
financial systems of their home countries. The Company typically enters into deposits and derivative 
contracts with parties that have a long term Standard and Poors "A" category rating or equivalent credit 
rating. The maximum exposure arising in the event of default on the part of the counterparty is the 
carrying value of the relevant financial instrument. The Company is authorised to place funds on deposit 
for periods up to 18 months. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital as well as the level of 
dividends to ordinary shareholders on an ongoing basis.
 The Company's revenues derive principally from airline travel on scheduled services, internet income and 
in-flight and related sales. Revenue is wholly derived from European routes. No individual customer 
accounts for a significant portion of total revenue.
 At March 31, 2012 EUR1.0 million (2011: EUR0.7 million, 2010: EUR0.6 million) of our total accounts 
receivable balance were past due, of which EUR0.1 million (2011: EUR0.1 million, 2010: EUR0.1 million) was 
impaired and provided for and EUR0.9 million (2011: EUR0.6 million, 2010: EUR0.5 million) was past due but 
not impaired. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
 (g)           Liquidity and capital management
 The Company's cash and liquid resources comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and 
restricted cash. The Company defines the capital that it manages as the Company's long-term debt and 
equity. The Company's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and 
market confidence and to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen 
events.
 The Company finances its working capital requirements through a combination of cash generated from 
operations and bank loans for the acquisition of aircraft. The Company had cash and liquid resources at 
March 31, 2012 of EUR3,515.6 million (2011: EUR2,940.6 million; 2010: EUR2,813.4 million). During the 
year, the Company funded EUR317.6 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment (2011: EUR897.2 
million,  2010: EUR997.8 million). Cash generated from operations has been the principal source for these 
cash requirements, supplemented primarily by aircraft-related financing structures.
 The Board of Directors periodically reviews the capital structure of the Company, considering the cost of 
capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Board approves any material adjustments 
to the capital structure in terms of the relative proportions of debt and equity.
 Ryanair has generally been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet its non-aircraft 
acquisition-related working capital requirements. Management believes that the working capital available 
to the Company is sufficient for its present requirements and will be sufficient to meet its anticipated 
requirements for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the 2013 fiscal year.
 (h)           Guarantees
 Details of the Company's guarantees and the related accounting have been disclosed in Note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
 (i)            Sensitivity analysis
 (i)            Interest rate risk: Based on the levels of and composition of year-end interest bearing 
assets and liabilities, including derivatives, at March 31, 2012, a plus or minus one-percentage-point 
movement in interest rates would result in a respective increase or decrease of EUR18.3 million (net of 
tax) in net interest income and expense in the income statement (2011: EUR10.9 million; 2010: EUR12.4 
million) and EUR36.9 million in equity. All of the Group's interest rate swaps are used to swap variable 
rate debt to fixed rate debt; consequently any changes in interest rates would have an equal and opposite 
income statement effect for both the interest rate swaps and the debt.
 (ii)           Foreign currency risk: A plus or minus change of 10% in relevant foreign currency exchange 
rates, based on outstanding foreign currency-denominated financial assets and financial liabilities at 
March 31, 2012 would have a respective positive or negative impact on the income statement of 
EUR1.8million (net of tax) (2011:  EUR3.7 million; 2010: EUR4.8 million) and on equity of EUR176.3 million 
(net of tax) (2011: EUR201.1 million; 2010: EUR153.0 million).
 (iii)          Equity price risk: A decrease of 10% in the Aer Lingus share price as of March 31, 2012 
would result in a decrease of EUR15.0 million in the fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets 
(2011: EUR11.4 million; 2010: EUR11.6 million). The decrease would be recognised in other comprehensive 
income. An increase of 10% in the Aer Lingus share price at March 31, 2012 would result in an increase of 
EUR15.0 million in the fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets reserve (2011:EUR11.4 
million; 2010: EUR11.6 million). Such an increase would be recognised in other comprehensive income.

 The components of the deferred and current taxation in the balance sheet are as follows:

Body
 The fair value of interest rate swaps is computed by discounting the projected cash flows on the Company's swap 
arrangements to present value using an appropriate market rate of interest. The fair value of forward foreign 
exchange contracts and commodity contracts is determined based on the present value of the quoted forward price. 
Recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
 Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative 
financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income (in the cash flow hedging reserve on the balance 
sheet). When the hedged forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the 
cumulative gain or loss is removed from other comprehensive income and included in the initial measurement of 
that asset or liability. Otherwise the cumulative gain or loss is removed from other comprehensive income and 
recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. The ineffective part of any hedging 
transaction and the gain or loss thereon is recognised in the income statement immediately.
 When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the underlying hedged transaction is still 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is 
recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is 
recognised in the income statement immediately.
 Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an 
unrecognised firm commitment, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement. 
The hedged item is also stated at fair value in respect of the risk being hedged, with any gain or loss also being 
recognised in the income statement.
 Inventories
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on invoiced price on an average 
basis for all stock categories. Net realisable value is calculated as the estimated selling price arising in the ordinary 
course of business, net of estimated selling costs.
 Trade and other receivables and payables
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -66-
 Trade and other receivables and payables are stated on initial recognition at fair value plus any incremental direct 
costs and subsequently at amortised cost, net (in the case of receivables) of any impairment losses, which 
approximates fair value given the short-dated nature of these assets and liabilities.
 Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash represents cash held at banks and available on demand, and is categorised for measurement purposes as 
"loans and receivables."
 Cash equivalents are current asset investments (other than cash) that are readily convertible into known amounts 
of cash, typically cash deposits of more than one day but less than three months at the date of purchase. Deposits 
with maturities greater than three months are recognised as short-term investments, are categorised as loans and 
receivables and are carried initially at fair value and then subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective-
interest method.
 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
 All loans and borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-current interest-bearing loans are measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest yield methodology.
 Leases
 Leases under which the Company assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet, at an amount equal to the 
lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments, and are depreciated over their 
estimated useful lives. The present values of the future lease payments are recorded as obligations under finance 
leases and the interest element of a lease obligation is charged to the income statement over the period of the 
lease in proportion to the balances outstanding.
 Other leases are operating leases and the associated leased assets are not recognised on the Company's balance 
sheet. Expenditure arising under operating leases is charged to the income statement as incurred. The Company 
also enters into sale-and-leaseback transactions whereby it sells the rights to an aircraft to an external party and 
subsequently leases the aircraft back, by way of an operating lease. Any profit or loss on the disposal where the 
price achieved is not considered to be at fair value is spread over the period during which the asset is expected to 
be used. The profit or loss amount deferred is included within "other creditors" and divided into components of 
greater than and less than one year.
 Provisions and contingencies
 A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation. If the 
effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future outflow at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
 The Company assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to contingencies, including legal matters, as well 
as probable losses. We record provisions for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred 
and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of 
the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured 
with reasonable reliability. Provisions are re-measured at each balance sheet date based on the best estimate of 
the settlement amount.
 In relation to legal matters, we develop estimates in consultation with internal and external legal counsel using the 
current facts and circumstances known to us. The factors that we consider in developing our legal provisions 
include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and number of other similar current and past litigation 
cases, the nature of the subject matter of the litigation, the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement 
discussions, if any.
 Segment reporting
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal organisational and management 
structure and the internal reporting information provided to the chief operating decision maker, who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of operating segments. The Company is managed as a single 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -66-
business unit that provides low fares airline-related services, including scheduled services, and ancillary services 
including car hire services, and internet and other related services to third parties, across a European route 
network.
 Income statement classification and presentation
 Individual income statement captions have been presented on the face of the income statement, together with 
additional line items, headings and sub-totals, where it is determined that such presentation is relevant to an 
understanding of our financial performance, in accordance with IAS 1, "Presentation of Financial Statements".
 Expenses are classified and presented in accordance with the nature-of-expenses method. We disclose separately 
on the face of the income statement, within other income and expense, losses on the impairment of available-for-
sale financial assets and gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment. The nature of the 
Company's available-for-sale asset is that of a financial investment; accordingly any impairment of the investment is 
categorised as finance expense and included in other income/(expense) as a separate line item. The presentation 
of gains or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment within other income/(expense) accords with 
industry practice.
 Revenues
 Scheduled revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline and other services, net of government taxes. Revenue 
from the sale of flight seats is recognised in the period in which the service is provided. Unearned revenue 
represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and a provision for government tax refund claims attributable to 
unused tickets, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Revenue, net of government taxes, is 
released to the income statement as passengers fly. Unused tickets are recognised as revenue on a systematic 
basis, such that twelve months of time expired revenues are recognised in revenue in each fiscal year. 
Miscellaneous fees charged for any changes to flight tickets are recognised in revenue immediately.
 During fiscal year 2012, changes in estimates relating to the timing of revenue recognition for unused passenger 
tickets were made, resulting in increased revenue in the current year of EUR65.3 million.  This change reflects more 
accurate and timely data obtained through system enhancements.
 Ancillary revenues are recognised in the income statement in the period the ancillary services are provided.

 The Company's purchase of 235 of the 294 Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the fleet as of March 31, 2012 has been 
funded by bank financing in the form of loans supported by a loan guarantee from Ex-Im Bank (with respect to 199 
aircraft), JOLCOs and commercial debt. With respect to these 235 aircraft, at March 31, 2012, the Company had 
outstanding cumulative borrowings under these facilities of EUR3,625.2 million with a weighted average interest 
rate of 2.9%. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital 
Resources" for additional information on these facilities and the related swaps, including a tabular summary of the 
"Effective Borrowing Profile" illustrating the effect of the swap transactions (each of which is with an established 
international financial counterparty) on the profile of Ryanair's aircraft-related debt at March 31, 2012. At March 31, 
2012, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements relating to this floating rate debt was represented by a loss 
of EUR80.3 million (gross of tax), as compared with a loss of EUR36.4 million at March 31, 2011. See Note 11 to 
the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for additional information.
 The Company also enters into interest rate swaps to hedge against floating rental payments associated with 
certain aircraft financed through operating lease arrangements. Through the use of interest rate swaps, Ryanair has 
effectively converted the floating-rate rental payments due under 12 of these leases into fixed-rate payments. At 
March 31, 2012, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements relating to leases on a mark-to-market basis 
was equivalent to approximately zero, as compared with a loss of EUR1.4 million at March 31, 2011. These 
financial instruments are, accordingly, recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are subsequently re-
measured to fair value through equity to the extent effective, with ineffectiveness recorded through the income 
statement. The Company has recorded no material level of ineffectiveness on these swaps as they have the same 
critical terms as the underlying item being hedged. Under IFRS, the Company accounts for all of its swaps as cash-
flow hedges of variable rental payments or variable rate debt payments. At March 31, 2012, the Company recorded 
a total fair-value adjustment of approximately nil relating to these arrangements, as compared with a EUR1.2 million 
negative fair-value adjustment at March 31, 2011. Losses will be realized within earnings over the period from the 
expected drawdown of the related financing (i.e., over a period of up to seven years from March 31, 2012), with an 
increase in the related interest expense.
 If Ryanair had not entered into such derivative agreements, a plus or minus one percentage point movement in 
interest rates would impact the fair value of this liability by approximately EUR36.2 million. The earnings and cash-
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -58-
flow impact of any such change in interest rates would have been approximately plus or minus EUR13.1 million in 
the 2012 fiscal year.
 Item 12. Description of Securities Other than Equity Securities
 Holders of ADSs are required to pay certain fees and expenses. The table below sets forth the fees and expenses 
which, under the deposit agreement between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, holders of ADRs 
can be charged or be deducted from dividends or other distributions on the deposited shares. The Company and 
The Bank of New York Mellon have also entered into a separate letter agreement, which the Company believes 
should have the effect of reducing some of the fees listed below. However, the Company and The Bank of New 
York Mellon have not yet reached final agreement on the exact application of such separate letter agreement to 
certain of the fees listed below, so it is possible that such fees may be assessed by The Bank of New York Mellon 
without any such reduction.
Persons depositing or withdrawing ADSs must pay:            For:
 ----------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------
-------------
 $5.00 (or less) per 100 ADSs (or portion of 100 ADSs).      Issuance of ADSs, including issuances 
resulting from a
 distribution of common shares or rights
 or other property.
Cancellation of ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal,
 including if the deposit agreement terminates.
$0.02 (or less) per ADS.                                    Any cash distribution to the holder of the

 Item 15. Controls and Procedures
 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 The Company has carried out an evaluation, as of March 31, 2012, under the supervision and with the 
participation of the Company's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial 
officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). There are inherent 
limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the 
possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. 
Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of 
achieving their control objectives. Based upon the Company's evaluation, the chief executive officer and 
chief financial officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2012, the disclosure controls and procedures 
were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports 
the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and 
when required, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is 
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the chief executive officer and chief 
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING-
 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over 
financial reporting, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Company's 
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with IFRS. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that:
 --      pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
 --      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors; and
 --      provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.
 The Company's management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated 
Framework," issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based 
on the evaluation, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over 
financial reporting as of March 31, 2012.

 In the case of an individual non-resident stockholder resident in an EU member state or tax treaty country, the 
declaration must be accompanied by a current certificate of tax residence from the tax authorities in the 
stockholder's country of residence. In the case of both an individual and corporate non-resident stockholder 
resident in an EU member state or tax treaty country the declaration also must contain an undertaking by the non-
resident or non-ordinarily resident person that he, she or it will advise the relevant person accordingly if he, she or it 
ceases to be a non-resident or non-ordinary resident. No declaration is required if the stockholder is a 5% parent 
company in another EU member state pursuant to the EC Parent-Subsidiary Directive (Council Directive No. 
90/435/EEC). Neither is a declaration required on the payment by a company resident in Ireland to another 
company so resident if the company making the dividend is a 51% subsidiary of that other company.
 American Depositary Receipts.Special arrangements with regard to the dividend withholding tax obligation apply in 
the case of Irish companies using ADRs through U.S. depositary banks that have been authorized by the Irish 
Revenue. Such banks, which receive dividends from the company and pass them on to the U.S. ADS holders 
beneficially entitled to such dividends, will be allowed to receive and pass on the gross dividends (i.e., before 
withholding) based on an "address system" where the recorded addresses of such holder, as listed in the 
depositary bank's register of depositary receipts, is in the United States.
 Taxation on Dividends. Companies resident in Ireland other than those taxable on receipt of dividends as trading 
income are exempt from corporation tax on distributions received on Ordinary Shares from other Irish resident 
companies. Stockholders that are "close" companies for Irish taxation purposes may, however, be subject to a 20% 
corporation tax surcharge on undistributed investment income.
 Individual stockholders who are resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland are subject to income tax on the gross 
dividend at their marginal tax rate, but are entitled to a credit for the tax withheld by the company paying the 
dividend. The dividend will also be subject to the new universal social charge.  An individual stockholder who is not 
liable or not fully liable for income tax by reason of exemption or otherwise may be entitled to receive an appropriate 
refund of tax withheld. A charge to Irish social security taxes/levies can also arise for such individuals on the 
amount of any dividend received from the Company.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -55-
 Except in certain circumstances, a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and is entitled to 
receive dividends without deductions is not liable for Irish tax on the dividends. Where a person who is neither 
resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland is subject to withholding tax on the dividend received due to not benefiting 
from any exemption from such withholding, the amount of that withholding will generally satisfy such person's 
liability for Irish tax.
 Capital Gains Tax. A person who is either resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland will generally be liable for Irish 
capital gains tax on any gain realized on the disposal of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs. The current capital gains tax 
rate is 30%. A person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and who does not carry on a trade in 
Ireland through a branch or agency will not be subject to Irish capital gains tax on the disposal of the Ordinary 
Shares or ADSs.
 Irish Capital Acquisitions Tax.A gift or inheritance of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs will be within the charge to Irish 
Capital Acquisitions Tax ("CAT") notwithstanding that the disposer (e.g., a donor) or the donee/successor in relation 
to such gift or inheritance is resident outside Ireland. CAT is charged at a rate of 30% above a tax-free threshold. 
This tax-free threshold is determined by the amount of the current benefit and of previous benefits taken since 
December 5, 1991, as relevant, within the charge to CAT and the relationship between the donor and the successor 
or donee. Gifts and inheritances between spouses (and in certain cases former spouses) are not subject to CAT.
 In a case where an inheritance or gift of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs is subject to both Irish CAT and foreign tax 
of a similar character, the foreign tax paid may in certain circumstances be credited in whole or in part against the 
Irish tax.
 Irish Stamp Duty. It is assumed for the purposes of this paragraph that ADSs are dealt in on a recognized stock 
exchange in the United States (NASDAQ is a recognized stock exchange in the United States for this purpose). 
Under current Irish law, no stamp duty will be payable on the acquisition of ADSs by persons purchasing such 
ADSs or on any subsequent transfer of ADSs. A transfer of Ordinary Shares (including transfers effected through 
Euroclear U.K. & Ireland Limited) wherever executed and whether on sale, in contemplation of a sale or by way of a 
gift, will be subject to duty at the rate of 1% of the consideration given or, in the case of a gift or if the purchase 
price is inadequate or unascertainable, on the market value of the Ordinary Shares. Transfers of Ordinary Shares 
that are not liable for duty at the rate of 1% (e.g., transfers under which there is no change in beneficial ownership) 
may be subject to a fixed duty of EUR12.50.
 The Irish Revenue treats a conversion of Ordinary Shares to ADSs made in contemplation of a sale or a change in 
beneficial ownership (under Irish law) as an event subject to stamp duty at a rate of 1%. The Irish Revenue has 
indicated that a re-conversion of ADSs to Ordinary Shares made in contemplation of a sale or a change in 
beneficial ownership (under Irish law) will not be subject to a stamp duty. However, the subsequent sale of the re-
converted Ordinary Shares will give rise to Irish stamp duty at the 1% rate. If the transfer of the Ordinary Shares is a 
transfer under which there is no change in the beneficial ownership (under Irish law) of the Ordinary Shares being 
transferred, nominal stamp duty only will be payable on the transfer. Under Irish law, it is not clear whether the mere 
deposit of Ordinary Shares for ADSs or ADSs for Ordinary Shares would be deemed to constitute a change in 
beneficial ownership. Accordingly, it is possible that holders would be subject to stamp duty at the 1% rate when 
merely depositing Ordinary Shares for ADSs or ADSs for Ordinary Shares and, consequently, the Depositary 
reserves the right in such circumstances to require payment of stamp duty at the rate of 1% from the holders.
 The person accountable for payment of stamp duty is the transferee or, in the case of a transfer by way of a gift or 
for a consideration less than the market value, all parties to the transfer. Stamp duty is normally payable within 30 
days after the date of execution of the transfer. Late or inadequate payment of stamp duty will result in liability for 
interest, penalties and fines.
 United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
 Except as described below under the heading "Non-U.S. Holders," the following is a summary of certain U.S. 
federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs 
by a holder that is a citizen or resident of the United States, a U.S. domestic corporation or otherwise subject to 
U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis in respect of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs ("U.S. Holders"). This 
summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to 
a decision to purchase the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs. In particular, the summary deals only with U.S. Holders 
that will hold Ordinary Shares or ADRs as capital assets and generally does not address the tax treatment of U.S. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -55-
Holders that may be subject to special tax rules such as banks, insurance companies, dealers in securities or 
currencies, partnerships or partners therein, entities subject to the branch profits tax, traders in securities electing to 
mark to market, persons that own 10% or more of the stock of the Company, U.S. Holders whose "functional 
currency" is not U.S. dollars or persons that hold the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs as part of an integrated 
investment (including a "straddle") consisting of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs and one or more other positions.
 Holders of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. or other tax 
consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs in light of their 
particular circumstances, including, in particular, the effect of any foreign, state or local tax laws.
 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders of the ADRs will be treated as the owners of the Ordinary Shares 
represented by those ADRs.
 Taxation of Dividends
 U.S. Holders
 Dividends, if any, paid with respect to the Ordinary Shares, including Ordinary Shares represented by ADRs, will 
be included in the gross income of a U.S. Holder when the dividends are received by the holder or the Depositary. 
Such dividends will not be eligible for the "dividends received" deduction allowed to U.S. corporations in respect of 
dividends from a domestic corporation. Dividends paid in euro will be includible in the income of a U.S. Holder in a 
U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the day they are received by the holder 
or the Depositary. U.S. Holders generally should not be required to recognize any foreign currency gain or loss to 
the extent such dividends paid in euro are converted into U.S. dollars immediately upon receipt.

 At March 31, 2012, the Company had total borrowings of EUR3,625.2 million (2011: EUR3,649.4 million; 
2010: EUR2,956.2 million) from various financial institutions, provided primarily on the basis of 
guarantees granted by the Export-Import Bank of the United States to finance the acquisition of 199 Boeing 
737-800 "next generation" aircraft (2011:185; 2010:151). The guarantees are secured with a first fixed 
mortgage on the delivered aircraft. The remaining long-term debt relates to 30 aircraft held under finance 
leases (2011: 30; 2010: 20), 6 aircraft financed by way of other commercial debt (2011: 6; 2010: 6) and 
aircraft simulators.

(a)  Remeasurement of the provision in respect of estimated cost of compensating passengers for costs 
incurred as a result of the closure of northern European airspace following the eruption of a volcano in 
Eyjafjallajokull, Iceland.
 (b)  Recognition of a provision of EUR8.2 million in respect of the restructuring of the Group's 
maintenance operation at Shannon, comprising onerous lease and related property costs (EUR5.1 million) and 
employee severance costs (EUR3.1 million).  The balance relates to the remeasurement of the provision for 
restructuring costs associated with the ongoing Greenfield cost reduction programme (EUR2.1 million) and 
Migration/Outsourcing Schemes (EUR1.4 million).
 (c)  The 2011 charge relates to the finalisation of the provision in respect of the 2008 "Leave and 
Return" scheme.
 (d)  Impairment on an owned A320 aircraft which is held for sale and continues to be actively marketed 
and the impairment of other assets no longer expected to be utilised.  The 2011 credit relates to the 
profit on disposal of a A330 aircraft.
 (e)  Release of amounts from cash flow hedging reserve related to capital foreign exchange hedges 
associated with planned purchase of three A330 aircraft and exercise in Q1 2011, of an option to convert 
those orders to three A350 aircraft.  Due to significant uncertainty regarding the Group's plans to take 
these aircraft, in accordance with IAS 39 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement" the amounts 
previously held in reserves in respect of those forecast cash flows have been released from cash flow 
hedging reserve and due to the significance of the amounts to the annual results, have been categorised as 
exceptional.
 (f)  Bid defence costs associated with a takeover bid from the Group's largest shareholder, Ryanair 
Holdings plc.  The bulk of these costs became payable to the Group's financial advisors as soon as the

(1) In the six months to 30 June 2012 there was a significant increase in ticket sales in advance due to 
the seasonal impact of passengers purchasing tickets in advance of travel in the summer months.  The fares 
collected for future travel are recorded as a liability until the passenger has flown at which time they 
are recognised as revenue.  The taxes and charges collected on these tickets are also recorded as a 
liability, in other amounts payable, until the passenger has flown at which time they become payable to 
the relevant authorities.
 14      Derivative financial instruments
 Derivative financial instruments represent the fair value of open forward foreign exchange contracts and 
fuel price swaps which the Group is a party to at the reporting date.  The fair value of these open 
positions is calculated by reference to the forward foreign exchange rates and forward fuel prices at the 
reporting date.  In the six months to 30 June 2012 the fair value of these open positions decreased 
significantly due to the fact that fuel prices were US$80 per metric tonne lower than at 31 December 2011. 
This was offset somewhat by the strengthening of the US Dollar against the Euro during the period, which 
increased the value of the Group's foreign exchange hedges.
 Deferred tax is provided on the gains/losses, arising from cash flow hedging positions, which are 
recognised in reserves.
 The statement of comprehensive income shows fair value losses to 30 June 2012 of EUR17.2 million (2011: 
EUR11.6 million).  These represent the mark to market losses on the Group's portfolio of fuel hedges, 
offset by the gain inherent in the Group's portfolio of foreign exchange hedges.

 Ryanair Holdings PLC
 30 July 2012
 On June 19(th)    Ryanair announced an all cash offer for Aer Lingus at EUR1.30 per share. Ryanair 
believes that its offer, if approved by the EU Commission, will be good for Aer Lingus' traffic growth, 
jobs and competition. An extensive process of engagement with the EU Commission is underway, and it is 
inappropriate to comment on the offer at this time.
 RYANAIR Q1 REVENUES GROW 11%, TRAFFIC GROWS 6% TO 22.5M
 PROFIT'S DECLINE 29% TO EUR99M - FULL YEAR GUIDANCE UNCHANGED.
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline today (Jul 30) announced that Q1 revenues increased 11% to 
EUR1,284m as traffic grew 6% and ave. fares rose 4%.  Unit costs rose 10% mainly due to a 27% (EUR117m) 
increase in fuel costs which led to a EUR40m decline in Q1 profit-as previously guided-to EUR99m.

Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "As we previously guided, significantly higher fuel costs caused Q1 profits to fall by EUR40m (from 
EUR139m last year's) to EUR99m.  Our 6% traffic growth combined with a 4% rise in ave. fares led to an 11% 
increase in Revenues.  Ancillary sales grew by 15% to EUR286m (outpacing traffic growth) accounting for 
22% of total revenues.  Operating unit costs rose 10% as fuel increased 27% (by EUR117m) to EUR544m.  Fuel 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
amounted to 47% of total operating costs.  We were hedged at $820 pt in Q1 last year compared to $1000 pt 
this year a price increase of 22%.  As a result Q1 will suffer the largest fuel cost rise in FY13 as the 
pricing differential narrows significantly over the remaining three quarters of the year.
 Q1 yield increases were dampened by the EU wide recession, austerity measures, and heavily discounted 
fares at our new base launches in Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Provincial UK and Spain.  Excluding 
fuel, Q1 unit costs rose by 3%, as we rigorously controlled costs, despite a 2% rise in flight crew pay, 
higher charges at certain airports, and the impact on costs of stronger Sterling against the Euro.
 Despite this challenging environment Ryanair continues to grow its traffic across Europe while 
maintaining the lowest unit costs in the airline industry, and generating healthy profits as evidenced by 
the 8% after tax margin achieved in the first quarter.
 Our new bases (Billund, Budapest, Manchester, Palma, Paphos and Wroclaw) are enjoying high load factors, 
although some smaller bases such as Budapest, Warsaw and Wroclaw are doing so at very low fares.  We 
announced our 51st base in Maastricht (Holland), which opens in December, and we plan to announce more new 
routes and up to 2 new bases later this year.  We continue to see significant opportunities to grow across 
Europe as many airports aggressively compete to attract Ryanair's traffic growth.
 On July 1 the Spanish government more than doubled airport taxes at AENA's already high cost airports in 
Madrid and Barcelona, with smaller increases at other Spanish airports.  These tax increases have already 
led to winter capacity cuts by Ryanair and many other airlines in Spain.  These cuts will damage Spanish 
tourism and jobs in a country that already suffers up to 50% youth unemployment.  It has been repeatedly 
proven that airport charges/tax increases lead to falling traffic, and the Spanish government must reverse 
these unjustified increases if they wish to grow Spain's tourism and generate new jobs.
 Ryanair welcomes the UK Court of Appeal's decision last week to dismiss the BAA/Ferrovial latest (7(th) ) 
appeal against the 2008 Competition Commission's recommendation that Stansted be sold to promote 
competition and the consumer interest.  We now call on the UK Competition Commission to expedite the sale 
of Stansted.  While BAA Stansted traffic declines (by 3% in June and 7% for H1 2012), both Heathrow and 
Gatwick have grown.  We believe Stansted's traffic decline can be reversed under new ownership which will 
lead to competition, lower charges, and improved passenger service at Stansted.
 We are 90% hedged for FY13 at approx. $1000 pt, up 21% on last year's price.  We have recently hedged 50% 
of our H1 FY14 requirement at $940 pt, however these lower fuel prices will be more than offset by lower 
euro to dollar exchange rates.  High oil prices and Europe's recession will drive further consolidation 
and more airline closures this winter.  This will open more growth opportunities for Ryanair because we 
have the youngest, most fuel efficient fleet as well as the lowest fares and costs.
 Our outlook remains cautious for the year.  We expect full year traffic to grow 4% (7% in H1, and 1% in 
H2 due to winter capacity cuts).  We expect positive yields will continue in Q2 and anticipate smaller 
fuel cost increases (due to higher Q2 comparable last year and fuel saving measures we have implemented).  
Currently, we have no visibility of next winter's yields but expect that continuing austerity, EU 
recession, and lower yields at new bases will to restrain fare growth.   Until we get some H2 yield 
visibility our guidance for FY 13 remains unchanged, in the range of EUR400m to EUR440m as previously 
guided".

 Operating and Financial Overview
 Summary quarter ended June 30, 2012
 Profit after tax decreased by 29% to EUR98.8m compared to EUR139.3m in the quarter ended June 30, 2011 
primarily due to a 27% increase in fuel costs, offset by a 4% increase in average fare and strong 
ancillary revenues. Total operating revenues increased by 11% to EUR1,283.9m as average fares rose by 4%.  
Ancillary revenues grew by 15%, faster than the 6% increase in passenger numbers, to EUR285.9m due to a 
combination of an improved product mix, and the roll out of reserved seating.  Total revenue per 
passenger, as a result, increased by 5% whilst Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 82% during the period 
compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
 Total operating expenses increased by 17% to EUR1,151.9m, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices, 
the higher level of activity, the strength of sterling to the euro and operating costs associated with the 
growth of the airline.  Fuel, which represents 47% of total operating costs compared to 43% in the prior 
period, increased by 27% to EUR543.8m due to the higher price per gallon paid and a 4% increase in the 
number of hours flown. Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 3%, including fuel unit costs rose by 10%.  
Operating margin decreased by 5 points to 10% whilst operating profit decreased by 22% to EUR132.0m.
 Net margin was down 4 points to 8%, compared to June 30, 2011.
 Basic earnings per share for the period were 6.86 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 9.35 
euro cent at June 30, 2011.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR292.0m since March 31, 2012 to EUR3,807.6m and Gross debt increased by 
EUR11.8m to EUR3,637.0m.  As a result we have moved from Net debt of EUR109.6m at March 31, 2012 to Net 
cash of EUR170.6m at June 30, 2012. The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR461.5m which 
funded net capital expenditure of EUR101.5m, debt repayments and a EUR67.5m share buy-back programme.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended June 30, 2012
 Profit after tax decreased by 29% to EUR98.8m primarily due to a 4% increase in average fares and strong 
ancillary revenues offset by a 27% rise in fuel costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 11% to 
EUR1,283.9m primarily due to a 4% increase in average fares, and a 6% rise in passenger numbers.  Fuel, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
which represents 47% of total operating costs compared to 43% in the prior year, increased by 27% to 
EUR543.8m due to a higher price per gallon paid and a 4% increase in the number of hours flown.  Unit 
costs excluding fuel rose by 3%, including fuel unit costs rose by 10%.  Operating margin, as a result of 
the above, decreased by 5 points to 10% whilst operating profit fell by 22% to EUR132.0m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 11% to EUR1,283.9m primarily due to a 4% rise in average fares 
which was partially impacted by the strength of sterling to the euro, a 6% increase in passenger numbers 
to 22.5m and strong ancillary revenues.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 5%, primarily due to a 4% increase in average fare and strong growth 
in ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 10% to EUR998.0m due to a 6% rise in passengers and a 4% rise 
in average fares, and was partially assisted by the strength of sterling to the euro.  Load factor 
decreased by 1 point to 82%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 15% to EUR285.9m, faster than the 6% increase in passenger volume, due to 
a combination of an improved product mix and the roll out of reserved seating.
 Total operating expenses increased by 17% to EUR1,151.9m due to the 27% rise in fuel costs, increased 
costs associated with the growth of the airline and the negative impact of the strength of sterling to the 
euro.
 Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR115.9m.  Excluding a credit of EUR2.5m in the comparative quarter 
relating to share-based compensation, staff costs increased by 6% due to a 4% increase in flight hours and 
a 2% pay increase for flight crew granted in April 2012.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 9% to EUR84.8m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity and a higher number of 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this quarter (June 30, 2012: 239) compared 
to the quarter ended June 30, 2011 (221).
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 27% to EUR543.8m due to higher fuel prices and the increased number of 
hours flown.
 Maintenance costs increased by 18% to EUR27.7m, due to the higher level of activity and the line 
maintenance costs arising from the launch of new bases.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 12% to EUR24.3m, due to a net increase from 51 to 55 leased aircraft 
and the negative impact of higher lessor financing costs for the 8 additional aircraft.  We handed back 4 
aircraft in the quarter due to the termination of leases.
 Route charges rose by 3% to EUR137.5m due to the increased number of sectors flown, offset by a slightly 
shorter sector length.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 9% to EUR166.3m, due to the 7% increase in sectors flown, higher 
airport charges at Dublin airport, increased airbridge charges in Spain, the mix of new routes and bases 
launched and the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs increased by EUR8.4m to EUR51.6m, reflecting higher marketing spend 
per passenger due to the launch of 6 new bases and new routes during the quarter.  Ancillary costs rose 
due to the increased level of sales.
 Operating margin decreased by 5 points due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
decreased by 22% to EUR132.0m.
 Finance income decreased by 21% to EUR7.7m primarily due to the decline in interest rates and this 
resulted in decreased yields on term deposits.
 Finance expense decreased by 2% to EUR26.4m primarily due to lower interest rates in the year compared to 
the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR292.0m since March 31, 2012 to EUR3,807.6m and Gross debt increased by 
EUR11.8m to EUR3,637.0m.  As a result we have moved from Net debt of EUR109.6m at March 31, 2012 to Net 
cash of EUR170.6m at June 30, 2012. The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR461.5m which 
funded net capital expenditure of EUR101.5m, debt repayments and a EUR67.5m share buy-back programme.
 Shareholders' equity decreased by EUR125.5m in the year to EUR3,181.2m due to the net profit after tax of 
EUR98.8m offset by share buy-backs and the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives and 
pensions, available for sale financial assets and employee share options.

 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.       Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland.  The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the three months ended June 30, 2012 comprise 
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2011 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2011, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2011 are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2012 do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group 
Accounts) Regulations, 1992.  The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 
31, 2012, together with the independent auditor's report thereon, will be filed with the Irish Registrar 
of Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting and will also be available on the Company's 
Website. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2011 have been filed with the 
Companies' Office. The auditors' report on those financial statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the interim 
financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2012 on July 27, 2012.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRS 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
 There were no new standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards adopted for the first 
time in the period ended June 30, 2012, which would have a material impact on our financial position or 
results from operations.
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. We do not anticipate that the adoption of

 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.        Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.          Income tax expense
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 
was 12.2% (June 30, 2011: 11.0%).  The tax charge for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 of EUR13.7m (June 
30, 2011: EUR17.3m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary differences for property, 
plant and equipment recognised in the income statement and the utilisation of previous trading losses.
 5.           Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR0.5m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At June 30, 2012 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 294 (2011: 272) Boeing 737-800 aircraft and had firm 
orders for an additional 11 Boeing 737-800's. The delivery of these firm order aircraft will increase the 
fleet size (net of lease hand-backs) to 305 aircraft by March 31, 2013.
 8.             Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR149.7m at March 31, 2012 to EUR160.8m at 
June 30, 2012 is comprised of a gain of EUR11.1m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR0.94 per share at March 31, 2012 to EUR1.01 
per share at June 30, 2012.
 9.           Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties.   The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:                               Quarter

 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the quarter amounted to EUR101.5m and is primarily aircraft.
 12.     Share buy-back
 On March 29, 2012, the Company agreed to buy back 15.0m ordinary shares at a cost of EUR67.5m.  This 
trade settled in early April 2012.  This is equivalent to approximately 1.0% of the Company's issued share 
capital. All ordinary shares repurchased have been cancelled.  Accordingly, share capital decreased by 
15.0m ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.1m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.1m. The capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to 
preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 13.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the quarter ended June 30, 2012 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2011 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.

 RYANAIR WELCOMES COURT OF APPEAL REJECTION OF  BAA'S                    7(th) APPEAL AGAINST SALE OF 
STANSTED
 CALLS FOR EARLY SALE TO PREVENT FURTHER BAA MISMANAGEMENT AS STANSTED TRAFFIC FALLS BY 600,000 PAX IN H1
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline, today (26 July) welcomed the Court of Appeal rejection of 
the BAA monopoly's 7(th) appeal against the sale of London Stansted Airport, as recommended by the 
Competition Commission (in 2008).  Ryanair called for the early sale of Stansted, where the BAA has 
presided over declines of 600,000 passengers in the first half of 2012, while Heathrow and Gatwick grow.  
This proves the BAA monopoly is damaging Stansted and harming consumers.
 Ryanair dismissed the absurd comments of BAA CEO, Colin Matthews, who this week claimed that Stansted was 
"a barometer of UK consumer spending" and added "when the UK consumer is confident again, we'll see growth 
quicker there than anywhere else".  Ryanair called on Mr Matthews to explain why Heathrow and Gatwick are 
growing, while BAA Stansted is raising prices and declining.

Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "Ryanair welcomes today's rejection by the Court of Appeal of the BAA's 7(th) appeal against the sale of 
Stansted, as first recommended by the UK Competition Commission back in 2008, over four years ago.
 "It is now time for Colin Matthews and Ferrovial, the Spanish owners of the BAA, to stop delaying the 
sale of Stansted and instead get on with it.  Since 2008 the BAA have doubled prices and Stansted and seen 
traffic decline from 24m in 2007 to 18m in 2011.
 These repeated BAA court appeals are nothing more than a blatant attempt to delay the sale while BAA and 
its Spanish owners, Ferrovial, fatten up its monopoly profits at the expense of airlines, passengers and 
British jobs.  This scamming by the BAA and Ferrovial must now end before even more traffic is lost at 
Stansted."

 18 June 2012
 Reject Ryanair's offer
 The Board of Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") notes the announcement made yesterday by Ryanair 
Holdings plc ("Ryanair") that it has posted its offer document containing the full terms and conditions of 
its offer to purchase the whole of the issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus not 
already owned by Ryanair (the "Offer").
 Ryanair's 2006 offer was prohibited by the European Commission on competition grounds, and your Board 
believes that the reasons for prohibition are now even stronger than before: the number of routes that 
Ryanair would monopolise has sharply increased. Your Board has received legal advice that the European 
Commission is likely once more to prohibit the Ryanair Offer, and that this is not therefore a credible 
Offer which is capable of completion.
 In addition, the UK Competition Commission is continuing to investigate the anti-competitive effects of 
Ryanair's 29.82% stake in Aer Lingus, despite Ryanair's repeated and ongoing attempts to stop both this 
investigation and the previous Office of Fair Trading investigation. Your Board has received legal advice 
that the UK Competition Commission is likely to require Ryanair to sell down its current stake.
 Aer Lingus is a robust and profitable airline with a proven business model, a strong balance sheet and an 
internationally recognised brand. Your Board's unanimous view is that Ryanair's Offer to acquire control 
of Aer Lingus for EUR1.30 per share fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus and represents a significant 
discount to the intrinsic value of the business:
 --     A discount of 31% to Aer Lingus' gross cash per share of EUR1.87 (total EUR1,002 million)
 -      the gross cash on Aer Lingus' balance sheet more than pays for Ryanair's offer
 --     A discount of 17% to Aer Lingus' Net Asset Value per share of EUR1.56 based on the NAV shown in 
the 31 December 2011 balance sheet
Aer Lingus Group PLC Reject Ryanair 's offer
 -      this NAV does not attribute any value to either our attractive slot portfolio or brand
 --     An adjusted EV / EBITDAR multiple of 4.2x, a 30% discount to the average trading multiple of Aer 
Lingus' traded peers of 6.1x
 Aer Lingus' strategy of building a leaner and more efficient business is working. Operational and 
financial performance has improved greatly since 2009, resulting in a turnaround in operating result since 
that time of approximately EUR130 million. We have transformed a loss making Aer Lingus into a profitable 
airline with one of the strongest balance sheets in the European sector.
 For the reasons outlined above, your Board believes that Ryanair's Offer is not in the interests of 
shareholders or Aer Lingus and is incapable of completion. Accordingly, the Board of Aer Lingus 
unanimously recommends shareholders should take no action in relation to the Offer and should not sign any 
document sent by Ryanair or its advisers.
 The Board of Aer Lingus will be writing to shareholders to set out in detail its reasons for rejecting 
the Offer within the next fourteen days in accordance with Rule 30.3(a) of the Irish Takeover Panel Act 
1997.

The directors of Aer Lingus accept responsibility for the information contained in this announcement. To 
the best of the knowledge and belief of the directors of Aer Lingus (who have taken all reasonable care to 
ensure that such is the case), the information contained in this announcement is in accordance with the 
facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information.
 Bases and Sources
 The relevant bases of calculation and sources of information are provided below in the order in which the 
relevant information first appears in this announcement and by reference to the relevant statement. Where 
such information is repeated in this document, the underlying bases and sources are not.
 (a)          Reference to "per share" is based on a fully diluted issued share capital of 535,540,090 
shares, including 534,040,090 ordinary shares in issue and 1,500,000 shares subject to options.  
Conditional awards over 9,017,971 ordinary shares under Aer Lingus' Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"), in 
relation to which the trustee of the LTIP does not hold shares for the purposes of satisfying any vesting 
of awards, have been excluded from the fully diluted issued share capital figure as it is not possible to 
calculate how many shares would vest on a change of control becoming effective.
 (b)          "gross cash" is taken from the  31 March 2012 balance sheet,  as reported in the first 
quarter Interim Management Statement.
 (c)           "Net Asset Value" or "NAV" is the amount shown as total equity in the  31 December 2011 
consolidated  balance sheet.
 (d)          Reference to "adjusted EV/EBITDAR multiple" is based on market capitalisations as at 16 July 
2012 and 31 December 2011 EBITDAR and balance sheet figures, calendarised as appropriate. Adjusted 
enterprise value ("EV") is defined as market capitalisation plus net debt (cash less restricted cash, plus 
book value of short term and long term debt excluding deferred income) and adjusted for unfunded pension 
deficits (as per company annual reports) post tax, book value of minority interests, and capitalised 
leases at relevant years annual lease cost multiplied by eight times (based on Moody's Investors Service 
Aer Lingus Group PLC Reject Ryanair 's offer
methodology for airlines) to arrive at an adjusted enterprise value. EBITDAR is defined as pre-exceptional 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft operating leases.
 (e)          Reference to "traded peers" includes Air France - KLM, easyJet, Flybe, IAG, Lufthansa and 
Ryanair.
 (f)           Reference to "turnaround in operating result" is to the improvement in operating profit or 
loss before exceptional items between 2009 and 2011.
 Dealing Disclosure Requirements
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, Takeover Rules 2007, as amended 
(the "Irish Takeover Rules"), if any person is, or becomes, 'interested' (directly or indirectly) in, 1 
percent, or more of any class of 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair, all 'dealings' in any 
'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair (including by means of an option in respect of, or a 
derivative referenced to, any such 'relevant securities') must be publicly disclosed by not later than 
3:30 pm (Dublin time) on the business day following the date of the relevant transaction. This requirement 
will continue until the date on which the Offer becomes effective or on which the 'Offer period' otherwise 
ends. If two or more persons co-operate on the basis of any agreement, either express or tacit, either 
oral or written, to acquire an 'interest' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair, they will be 
deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules.
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.1 of the Irish Takeover Rules, all 'dealings' in 'relevant securities' of 
Aer Lingus by Ryanair or 'relevant securities' of Ryanair by Aer Lingus, or by any of their respective 
'associates' must also be disclosed by no later than 12 noon (Dublin time) on the business day following 
the date of the relevant transaction.
 A disclosure table, giving details of the companies in whose 'relevant securities' 'dealings' should be 
disclosed can be found on the Panel's website at www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie.
 'Interests in securities' arise, in summary, when a person has long economic exposure, whether 
conditional or absolute, to changes in the price of securities. In particular, a person will be treated as 
having an 'interest' by virtue of the ownership or control of securities, or by virtue of any option in 
respect of, or derivative referenced to, securities.
 Terms in quotation marks are defined in the Irish Takeover Rules, which can also be found on the Irish 
Takeover Panel's website. If you are in any doubt as to whether or not you are required to disclose a 
dealing under Rule 8, please consult the Panel's website at            www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie or

 20 June 2012
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 ISE: EIL1       LSE: AERL
 STATEMENT REGARDING RYANAIR OFFER
 Dublin & London 20 June 2012: The Board of Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") has considered the 
announcement by Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair") of its intention to make a third unsolicited offer for 
100 per cent. of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus (the "Offer").
 In evaluating any offer, the Board must consider the uncertainties and risks relating to it.  The UK 
Competition Commission ("CC") is currently investigating Ryanair's 29.82 per cent. holding in Aer Lingus 
with the result that Ryanair is now under a legal prohibition from undertaking any further integration 
with Aer Lingus without the consent of the CC; and may be subject to an order to sell down its shares at 
the end of the CC investigation.  Furthermore the Board notes that Ryanair's unsolicited offer in 2006 was 
blocked by the European Commission and was not capable of completion and that Ryanair's second offer, in 
2008, was withdrawn. Consequently there is significant uncertainty that any offer from Ryanair, if made, 
would be capable of completion.
 The Aer Lingus management team has delivered a significantly improved operational and financial 
performance since 2009, transforming Aer Lingus into a robust, profitable airline which is well positioned 
to serve the key role of "Connecting Ireland to the World". Management's successful strategy of focusing 
on demand-led network management and the introduction of extensive cost saving initiatives has delivered 
sustained and improved profitability, resulting in a turnaround in operating performance of approximately 
EUR130 million since 2009. Aer Lingus has a proven business model and a strong balance sheet including 
cash of in excess of EUR1 billion at 31 March 2012, leaving it well positioned for the future.
 The Board, having considered the Offer with its advisers, believes the Offer, even if it is capable of 
completion, undervalues Aer Lingus.
 Aer Lingus shareholders are accordingly advised to take no action in relation to the Offer.

 Cash Offer
 by
 Coinside Limited
 a wholly owned subsidiary
 of
 Ryanair Holdings plc
 for
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 1. Introduction
 The Board of Ryanair today announces the terms of a Cash Offer for 100 percent of the entire issued and to be 
issued share capital of Aer Lingus.  Ryanair intends to make this Offer through its wholly-owned subsidiary, 
Coinside. The Ryanair Group owns approximately 29.82 percent of the current issued share capital of Aer Lingus 
and expects to accept the Cash Offer in respect of these shares. The making of the Cash Offer is subject to certain 
conditions set out in Appendix I, including amongst other conditions, the acceptance by Aer Lingus Shareholders 
holding more than 50 percent of the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus, and Ryanair obtaining 
European Commission clearance or (as the case may be) Irish and other applicable EU member state competition 
law clearance for the combination of Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
 2. The Cash Offer
 Coinside will offer to acquire all of the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus, subject to the conditions 
and on the terms set out in Appendix I to this announcement and the full terms and conditions which well be set out 
in the Offer Document and the related Form of Acceptance, on the following basis:
 EUR1.30 in cash for every Aer Lingus Share
 The Cash Offer values the entire issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus at approximately EUR694m.  The key 
features of the Offer are:
 -- It is an all Cash Offer;
 -- It represents a premium of 38.3 percent over the Closing Price (EUR0.94) of an Aer Lingus Share on 19 June 
2012 (being the last day prior to the date of this announcement); and
 -- It represents a premium of 46.7 percent over the average Closing Price (EUR0.89) of an Aer Lingus share for the 
six months to 19 June 2012.
 Ryanair believes that the Cash Offer represents very attractive and certain value to Aer Lingus Shareholders. If it 
accepts the Cash Offer, and the Offer is successful, the Irish Government will realise, with certainty, EUR174m from 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -3-
the sale of its Aer Lingus Shares in addition to the approximate EUR4m which it will receive by way of the (already 
declared) Aer Lingus dividend. This is clearly beneficial in the context of the current recessionary environment and 
will make a valuable contribution towards budget spending in such important areas as health and education.
 In addition, the combination will establish for Ireland one of Europe's "Big Five" airline groups which will be 
financially strong, Irish managed and headquartered; a key objective of all stakeholders.  This new airline group will 
have the cleanest, most fuel efficient fleet of Europe's "Big Five" airline groups.
 In contrast, Ryanair believes that the Aer Lingus shareholders and other stakeholders in Aer Lingus continue to 
face significant uncertainty with regard to the long term future operating, financial and share price performance of 
Aer Lingus as an independent airline. The airline sector remains under pressure from the global economic 
recession and high oil prices.  More carriers have failed in 2012 to date (including Malev, Spanair, Skyways and 
Cimber Sterling). A sub-scale peripheral EU flag carrier like Aer Lingus which is overly dependent on a deteriorating 
Irish economy is, we believe, significantly exposed to the global recession. In addition, we believe that Aer Lingus 
has few realistic third-party alternatives.
 The Offer will extend to all Aer Lingus Shares unconditionally issued on the date of the Offer, together with any 
further such shares which are unconditionally issued while the Offer remains open for acceptance or until such 
earlier date as, subject to the Takeover Rules, Ryanair may determine.
 The Aer Lingus Shares are to be acquired fully paid or credited as fully paid and free from all liens, charges, 
equitable interests and encumbrances, rights of pre-emption and any other rights or interests of any nature 
whatsoever and together with all rights now and hereafter attaching thereto including voting rights and the right to 
receive and retain all dividends and other distributions (if any) declared, made or paid thereafter. For the avoidance 
of doubt, the Aer Lingus dividend declared on 4 May 2012 is scheduled to be paid on 31 July 2012, and will be 
received by Aer Lingus Shareholders in addition to any consideration received under the Offer.
 The Offer shall be made by Coinside, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair.

 The availability of the Offer to persons outside Ireland may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. Such 
persons should inform themselves about and observe any applicable requirements. The Offer will not be made, 
directly or indirectly, in or into Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa, the United States or any other jurisdiction

any such means, instrumentality or facility from or within Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa, the United States

in, into or from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa, the United States or any other jurisdiction where it would be 
unlawful to do so. Persons receiving such documents (including, without limitation, nominees, trustees and 
custodians) should observe these restrictions. Failure to do so may invalidate any related purported acceptance of 
the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, Ryanair reserves the right to permit the Offer to be accepted if, 
in its sole discretion, it is satisfied that the transaction in question is exempt from or not subject to the legislation or 
regulation giving rise to the restrictions in question.
 The Offer will be governed by Irish law.  The Offer will be subject to the applicable requirements of the Takeover 
Rules, the Panel, the Irish Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the UK Listing Authority and all applicable 
laws.
 Appendix I of this attached announcement sets out the conditions and principal further terms of the Cash Offer. 
Appendix II of this announcement contains source notes relating to certain information contained in this 
announcement. Certain terms used in this announcement are defined in Appendix III of the attached 
announcement.
 The directors of Ryanair and Coinside accept responsibility for the information contained in this announcement 
other than that relating to Aer Lingus, the Aer Lingus Group, the directors of Aer Lingus and persons connected with 
them. To the best of the knowledge and belief of the directors of Ryanair and Coinside (who have taken all 
reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the information contained in this announcement for which they 
accept responsibility is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such 
information.
 This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to 
subscribe for any securities. Any response in relation to the Offer should only be made on the basis of the 
information contained in the Offer Document or any document by which the Offer is made.
 This announcement, including information included or incorporated by reference in this announcement, may 
contain 'forward-looking statements' concerning the Cash Offer, Ryanair, and Aer Lingus. Generally, the words 'will', 
'may', 'should', 'could', 'would', 'can', 'continue', 'opportunity', 'believes', 'expects', 'intends', 'anticipates', 'estimates' 
or similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements involve risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking 
statements. Many of these risks and uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond the Ryanair and Coinside's 
abilities to control or estimate precisely, such as future market conditions and the behaviours of other market 
participants, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Neither Ryanair nor Coinside 
assumes any obligation in respect of, nor intends to update these forward-looking statements, except as required 
pursuant to applicable law.
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, Takeover Rules 2007, as amended (the 
"Irish Takeover Rules"), if any person is, or becomes, 'interested' (directly or indirectly) in, 1 percent or more of any 
class of 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair, all 'dealings' in any 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or 
Ryanair (including by means of an option in respect of, or a derivative referenced to, any such 'relevant securities') 
must be publicly disclosed by not later than 3:30 pm (Dublin time) on the business day following the date of the 
relevant transaction. This requirement will continue until the date on which the Offer becomes effective or on which 
the 'Offer period' otherwise ends. If two or more persons co-operate on the basis of any agreement, either express 
or tacit, either oral or written, to acquire an 'interest' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair, they will be 
deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules.
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.1 of the Irish Takeover Rules, all 'dealings' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus by 
Ryanair or 'relevant securities' of Ryanair by Aer Lingus, or by any of their respective 'associates' must also be 
disclosed by no later than 12 noon (Dublin time) on the business day following the date of the relevant transaction.
 A disclosure table, giving details of the companies in whose 'relevant securities' 'dealings' should be disclosed can 
be found on the Panel's website at www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie.
 'Interests in securities' arise, in summary, when a person has long economic exposure, whether conditional or 
absolute, to changes in the price of securities. In particular, a person will be treated as having an 'interest' by virtue 
of the ownership or control of securities, or by virtue of any option in respect of, or derivative referenced to, 
securities.
 Terms in quotation marks are defined in the Irish Takeover Rules, which can also be found on the Irish Takeover 
Panel's website. If you are in any doubt as to whether or not you are required to disclose a dealing under Rule 8,

+353 1 678 9020; fax number +353 1 678 9289.

 "This Offer represents a significant opportunity to combine Aer Lingus with Ryanair, to form one strong 
Irish airline group capable of competing with Europe's other major airline groups led by Air France, 
British Airways and Lufthansa.  Since the European Commission recently approved BA's takeover of British 
Midland (being the latest in a series of EU airline consolidations), and Etihad recently invested in Aer 
Lingus and there are reports that it has a "strong interest" to acquire the Government's stake, and since 
the Irish Government has decided to sell this stake, we believe now is the time to focus on the right 
long-term strategic partner for Aer Lingus.
 This Offer is, we believe, the best way for Aer Lingus to continue to be owned, controlled and managed 
from Ireland for the benefit of Irish citizens and visitors.  With Ryanair's help, we believe that Aer 
Lingus can grow its traffic from a current figure of 9.5m passengers (8.4% fewer than its 2009 figure of 
10.4m) to over 14m passengers over a five year period post completion, by growing Aer Lingus' short-haul 
fleet to offer more competition at some of Europe's major airports where currently Aer Lingus operates and 
Ryanair has no desire to fly.
 Ryanair also believes that Aer Lingus' transatlantic operations from Ireland, which have been reduced in 
recent years (by closing the Shannon transatlantic services in winter and transferring one aircraft to 
operate for United on the Washington-Madrid route), will benefit from investment to grow materially over 
the same period.
 In six years as a public company, Aer Lingus has failed to deliver value for shareholders.  Its traffic 
of 8.6m in 2006 grew to 10.4m in 2009 only to fall to 9.5m in 2011.  Operating profits pre exceptionals 
have lurched from EUR32m in 2006, to a loss of EUR81m in 2009, to a profit of EUR49m in 2011.  Over the 
past 6 years, Aer Lingus' cumulative operating profits pre exceptionals of EUR111m have been dwarfed by 
their cumulative exceptional costs of over EUR353m.  As a result, Aer Lingus shareholders have seen the 
value of their shares fall from a high of EUR3.35 in mid 2007, to just EUR0.94 on Tuesday 19 June 2012, a 
decline of approximately 72%.
 By contrast, during this period Ryanair has grown its traffic from 51m in FY March 2008 to 76m in FY 
March 2012.   Ryanair's annual profit after tax has risen to just over EUR500m, and Ryanair is returning 
some EUR1.5 billion to shareholders via two special dividends and four share buybacks.
 We believe this Offer, if successful, will create value for Ryanair shareholders.  We believe that by 
lowering Aer Lingus' unit costs and fares, growing its business at some of Europe's major airports, and 
competing with high fare incumbents, Ryanair can significantly increase Aer Lingus' profitability thereby 
earning superior returns for Ryanair's shareholders.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -2-
 We believe that Ryanair's Offer of EUR1.30 now offers Aer Lingus' long suffering shareholders a real and 
meaningful return which represents a 38.3% premium to its closing price of EUR0.94 on Tuesday 19 June 
2012.  It allows the Irish Government to deliver the first of its assets sale obligations to the Troika, 
and it enables Aer Lingus to secure a financially strong, Irish based, airline partner committed to 
keeping Aer Lingus as a separate airline while developing the Aer Lingus brand and business.  Ryanair 
believes this Offer will ensure that Ireland will have two separate airlines in one strong airline group, 
with combined traffic of almost 90m passengers p.a., capable of growing Aer Lingus' traffic and creating 
new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers within a dynamic and expanding airline".

 Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or from Australia, Canada,

 Cash Offer
 by
 Coinside Limited
 a wholly owned subsidiary
 of
 Ryanair Holdings plc
 for
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 Summary
 The Board of Ryanair Holdings plc today announces its intention to make an all cash offer of EUR1.30 per 
share for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus Group plc, valuing the current 
issued share capital of Aer Lingus at approximately EUR694m.  Ryanair intends to make this Offer through 
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Coinside Limited (Coinside).  Ryanair already owns 29.82 percent of Aer 
Lingus, a stake which it largely acquired over five years ago in late 2006 and early 2007.  This cash 
offer represents:
 --      a premium of 38.3 percent over the Closing Price of an Aer Lingus Share of EUR0.94 on 19 June 
2012, the last day prior to this announcement; and
 --      a premium of 46.7 percent over the average Closing Price of an Aer Lingus Share for the 6 months 
to 19 June 2012.
 The Offer Price of EUR1.30 is in addition to the dividend for each Aer Lingus share of approximately 
EUR0.03 declared by Aer Lingus on 4 May 2012 and payable on 31 July 2012.
 Timing of this Offer
 Ryanair believes that as the air transport market in Europe inexorably consolidates into five large 
airlines/groups led by Air France, British Airways (BA), Easyjet, Lufthansa and Ryanair, the long term 
future of Aer Lingus, its brand and its growth prospects can best be secured within one strong Irish 
airline group, led by Ryanair, under which Aer Lingus' fares and unit cost can be reduced and its recent 
traffic decline (from 10.4m in 2009 to 9.5m in 2011) can be reversed.  If this Offer is successful, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer for Aer Lingus
Ryanair intends that Aer Lingus will be put on a growth trajectory which will allow Aer Lingus to provide 
more competition and consumer choice at a number of Europe's primary airports where currently Aer Lingus 
flies but where Ryanair does not wish to operate.
 Ryanair also believes that circumstances have changed materially since its first unsuccessful bid for Aer 
Lingus in late 2006 and that there are compelling reasons why Ryanair's new all Cash Offer should be 
accepted by a majority of Aer Lingus shareholders, and should also be approved by the EU competition 
authorities in light of these changed circumstances which include:
 1.   Europe's flag carriers are consolidating
 Since 2006, Europe's flag carrier airlines have continued to consolidate.  Air France, which owns KLM, 
acquired a 25 percent stake in Alitalia.  BA merged with Iberia to create IAG and then acquired British 
Midland (BMI). Lufthansa acquired Swiss Air and Austrian Air, as well as taking significant minority 
stakes in SN Brussels and SAS.  Each of these transactions has been approved by the competition 
authorities. The most significant of these consolidations is the recent IAG (BA and Iberia) takeover of 
BMI, where the No.1 airline at Heathrow was allowed to acquire the No.2.  This transaction was approved 
despite the fact that Heathrow is one of Europe's most congested airports and where there is little, if 
any, opportunity for new entrants or increased competition to develop. The Polish and Portuguese 
Governments have also confirmed their intention to sell their national airlines, LOT and TAP, 
respectively. Contrary to these trends, Aer Lingus has since 2006 failed to find a consolidation partner 
and Ryanair believes that as a consequence, Aer Lingus remains a sub-scale, peripheral EU carrier which 
has no long term independent future.
 2.   Dublin Airport is now operating at approx 50 percent capacity
 When Ryanair first bid for Aer Lingus in late 2006, Dublin Airport was suffering significant congestion, 
with the runway and terminal building operating at, or close to, full capacity during peak periods, which 
rendered it difficult for new entrants to offer services or competition to/from Dublin.  However, since 
2007 traffic at Dublin Airport has fallen by 20 percent from 23.3m passengers per annum (MPPA) to 18.7 
MPPA in 2011, while capacity at the airport has increased to 35 MPPA following the November 2010 opening 
of Terminal 2.  As a result, Dublin Airport is now operating at approximately 50 percent capacity, which 
creates significant availability throughout the day, thereby removing this barrier to any new entrants to 
Dublin Airport.
 3.   The Irish Government has decided to sell its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus
 Since the 2006 Offer, the Irish Government policy towards its 25 percent shareholding in Aer Lingus has 
changed.   When Aer Lingus floated in October 2006, the Irish Government retained a 25 percent 
shareholding for "strategic" purposes.  As recently as 9 May 2012, the Irish Government confirmed that it 
"has decided that the State's remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus will be sold at an appropriate time, 
but only when market conditions are favourable and at an acceptable price to be agreed by Government".  
The Minister for Transport has previously indicated that the Government will not dispose of its stake for 
less than EUR1 per share.
 Ryanair's new Offer does not require acceptance by the Irish Government in order to be successful, 
although Ryanair believes that this Offer represents the only means by which the Irish Government can 
ensure that Aer Lingus will continue to be owned and managed in, as well as focused upon, Ireland.  
Accordingly, Ryanair hopes that the Irish Government will accept and support this Offer.
 4.   The Irish Government has committed to the Troika to pursue an early sale of its Aer Lingus stake
 Ryanair understands that the Irish Government has committed to the Troika (of the European Union, the 
European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund), to raise funds from the sale of State assets.  
One of these assets is the 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus, and Ryanair believes it is likely that the 
Irish Government will seek to dispose of this stake in early 2013.  Since the Government's stake in Aer 
Lingus will now be sold, the important policy issue is whether it will be sold to a successful Irish based 
company which will support growing Aer Lingus' traffic, lowering its unit costs and creating new jobs, or 
whether it will be sold to a non Irish investor which will, Ryanair believes, lead to the inevitable 
break-up of Aer Lingus.  The timing of this Offer is designed to allow the European Commission sufficient 
time to complete its competition review prior to the end of Q1 2013 at the latest.
 5.   The ESOT no longer controls 15 percent of Aer Lingus
 At the time of Ryanair's unsuccessful 2006 Offer for Aer Lingus, the ESOT controlled 15 percent of Aer 
Lingus. However, since the ESOT has been disbanded since December 2010, and the shares distributed to 
individual members, Ryanair's new Offer is clearly capable of reaching over 50 percent acceptances either 
with or without the acceptance of this Offer by the Irish Government.
 6.   Etihad recently bought approx 3 percent of Aer Lingus and is reported to have a "strong interest" in 
acquiring the Government's stake
 Aer Lingus has argued that Ryanair's minority stake would deter other airlines or investors from 
investing in Aer Lingus.  This claim has been disproven by the recent (1 May 2012) confirmation that 
Etihad had acquired a 2.99 percent shareholding in Aer Lingus, and is reported as having a "strong 
interest in buying the Government's 25 percent stake when it is put up for sale".
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer for Aer Lingus
 Ryanair believes that its new Offer for Aer Lingus now provides Etihad or any other party with the 
opportunity to bid for the Government's 25 percent stake, should they wish to do so.  It also enables the 
Irish Government to maximise the proceeds from any disposal by not excluding Ryanair from bidding and 
ensures that the Government can achieve a significant premium to Aer Lingus' recent share price of less 
than EUR1.
 Ryanair has confirmed that should Etihad (or any other investor) acquire the Government's stake, then 
Ryanair would be willing to work with that party to grow Aer Lingus successfully, or alternatively Ryanair 
would be willing to enter into discussions with that party with a view to disposing of Ryanair's 
shareholding subject to agreement on price.
 7.   Ryanair is willing to offer appropriate remedies to allay any competition concerns
 In the light of the above significant changes in circumstances, Ryanair is confident that its new Offer 
for Aer Lingus should be accepted by over 50 percent of Aer Lingus' shareholders and should also be 
approved by the European Commission.  Ryanair believes that any competition concerns which the European 
Commission may have can be addressed by Ryanair making appropriate remedies prior to the completion of 
this Offer and by significant synergies and cost efficiencies resulting from this combination.
 8.   Ryanair's growth and Aer Lingus' decline means this Offer no longer requires Ryanair shareholder 
approval
 At the time of the 2006 Offer, Aer Lingus represented in excess of 25 percent of Ryanair's gross assets 
and, accordingly, the transaction would have required Ryanair shareholder approval.  Since 2006, Ryanair 
has increased in size, while the market value of Aer Lingus has declined, and accordingly this Offer is 
not a "significant transaction" under the Listing Rules and will not require Ryanair shareholder approval.
 Speaking about this Offer, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary said:

 4. Information on Ryanair and Coinside
 Ryanair operates a low fares airline operating short haul, point-to-point routes from its 51 bases across 
Europe. In operation since 1985, Ryanair pioneered the low fares model in Europe.  As of June 2012, the 
Company offers over 1,500 dailyflights serving some 170 airports across Europe, with a fleet of 294 Boeing 
737-800 aircraft.
 For the year ended 31 March 2012, Ryanair's turnover was EUR4,325m and its profit after tax was EUR503m.
 Coinside is a wholly owned non-operating subsidiary of Ryanair.  Coinside has not traded except for 
entering into transactions relating to Aer Lingus Shares.
 Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley are acting as financial advisers to Ryanair and Coinside.
 5. Reasons for the Offer and Ryanair's Strategy for Aer Lingus
 Ryanair proposes to operate the two airlines separately within one strong Irish airline group under 
common ownership. Similar to previous European airline consolidations such as Air France/KLM/Alitalia, 
Lufthansa/Swiss/Austrian and BA/Iberia, both airlines will maintain separate distinctive brands, thereby 
preserving the best features of both, including Ryanair's low fare, high punctuality flights, and Aer 
Lingus' high frequency services to major city airports and its transatlantic operations.
 Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus is a sub-scale peripheral EU flag carrier which has been bypassed by 
ongoing EU wide flag carrier consolidation and that Aer Lingus needs to find a strong airline partner to 
secure its long term future. Over the past two years, the trading environment and competitive landscape 
for all European airlines has deteriorated dramatically with high oil prices and the global recession. 
This has triggered another wave of EU airline closures and failures.  In response, EU airline 
consolidation has accelerated as Europe sees the emergence of five large airline groups, led by Air 
France, British Airways, Easyjet, Lufthansa and  Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline.
 Ryanair believes that the harsh economic downturn, coupled with accelerating industry consolidation, 
leaves Aer Lingus exposed as a small and uncompetitive airline.  Ryanair believes that this Offer provides 
Aer Lingus with a financially strong partner within one Irish airline group where Aer Lingus can develop 
its separate brand, expand its fleet, while improving its competitiveness by lowering unit costs and 
fares.
 As an island nation, with an economy in recession, it is critical that Ireland continues to benefit from 
strong and secure low fare airline services in order to sustain and support tourism, jobs and economic 
growth.  Ryanair believes that the Offer may help to combat recent Irish traffic and tourism declines. 
Against this background, Ryanair looks forward to obtaining European Commission clearance for this pro-
consumer combination.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -4-
 As outlined above, Ryanair envisages that the two airlines will be run as separate competing subsidiaries 
of Ryanair Holdings plc.  Both airlines will be expected to grow and expand following the completion of 
this Offer.   Ryanair believes that this Offer, if successful, will create value for Ryanair shareholders.  
Ryanair believes that by lowering Aer Lingus' unit costs and fares, growing its fleet and traffic at some 
of Europe's major airports, and competing with high fare incumbents, Ryanair can significantly increase 
Aer Lingus' profitability thereby earning superior returns for Ryanair shareholders.
 6. Financing
 The Offer will be financed from the cash reserves of Ryanair.
 Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley confirm they are satisfied that resources are available to 
Ryanair sufficient to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer.
 7. Employees
 Following the Cash Offer becoming or being declared unconditional in all respects, the existing 
employment rights of the management and employees of the Aer Lingus Group will be safeguarded in 
accordance with statutory requirements.
 8. Ryanair Shareholder Approval
 At the time of the 2006 Offer, Aer Lingus represented in excess of 25 percent of Ryanair's gross assets 
and, accordingly, the transaction would have required Ryanair shareholder approval.  Since 2006, Ryanair 
has increased in size, while the market value of Aer Lingus has declined, and accordingly this Offer is 
not a "significant transaction" under the Irish Listing Rules and will not require Ryanair shareholder 
approval.
 9. Offer Document
 The Offer Document, containing the full terms and conditions of the Offer, will be posted as soon as 
practicable to Aer Lingus Shareholders.
 10. Disclosure of Interests in Aer Lingus
 As at the close of business on 19 June 2012, being the latest practicable day prior to the date of this 
announcement, Ryanair owned 159,231,025 Aer Lingus Shares representing approximately 29.82 percent of the 
existing issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus. As at the close of business on 18 June 2012, being 
the latest practicable day for this purpose, parties acting in concert with Ryanair owned 1,093,033 Aer 
Lingus Shares representing 0.2 percent of the existing issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus, of 
which 578,033 Aer Lingus Shares were held by an affiliate of Davy Corporate Finance on own account and on 
behalf of a number of discretionary clients and of which Morgan Stanley Securities Limited held 515,000 
Aer Lingus Shares on own account.
 Save for these interests, neither Ryanair, Coinside, nor the directors of Ryanair or Coinside, nor any 
party acting in concert with Ryanair or Coinside, owns or controls any Aer Lingus Shares or holds any 
options to acquire or subscribe for any Aer Lingus Shares or any derivative referenced to Aer Lingus 
Shares.
 Neither Ryanair, Coinside nor any persons acting in concert with Ryanair or Coinside has any arrangement 
in relation to Aer Lingus Shares, or any securities convertible or exchangeable into Aer Lingus Shares or 
options (including traded options) in respect of, or derivatives referenced to, Aer Lingus Shares. For 
these purposes, 'arrangement' includes an indemnity or option arrangement, any agreement or understanding, 
formal or informal, of whatever nature, relating to relevant securities which is, or may be, an inducement 
to deal or refrain from dealing in such securities.
 11. Regulatory Issues
 As discussed above, Ryanair looks forward to obtaining European Commission approval for the transaction 
and implementing its proposed pro-consumer combination.
 12. Settlement, Compulsory Acquisition, De-listing and Re-registration
 The consideration will, in relation to Aer Lingus Shareholders who validly accept the Cash Offer up to 
the time the Cash Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects, be despatched not later than 
14 days after the Cash Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects, or thereafter within 14 
days of receipt of acceptance of the Cash Offer.
 If Coinside receives acceptances of the Cash Offer in respect of, and/or otherwise acquires, 90 percentor 
more of the Aer Lingus Shares to which the Cash Offer relates (and in the case where the Aer Lingus Shares 
to which the Cash Offer relates are voting shares, not less than 90 percent of the voting rights carried 
by those Aer Lingus Shares) and assuming all other conditions of the Cash Offer have been satisfied or 
waived (if they are capable of being waived), Coinside intends to exercise its rights pursuant to the 
provisions of Regulation 23 of the Takeover Regulations to acquire the remaining Aer Lingus Shares to 
which the Cash Offer relates on the same terms as the Cash Offer.
 If Coinside receives acceptances of the Cash Offer in respect of, and/or otherwise acquires 75 percent or 
more of the Aer Lingus Shares to which the Cash Offer relates it intends, as soon as it is appropriate and 
possible to do so and, subject to the Offer becoming or being declared unconditional in all respects, and 
to any applicable requirements of the Irish Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange or the UK Listing 
Authority, to apply for the cancellation of the listing of the Aer Lingus Shares on the Irish Stock 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -4-
Exchange and the UK Official List and for the cancellation of admission to trading of Aer Lingus Shares on 
the markets of the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange and it intends to propose a 
resolution to re-register Aer Lingus as a private company under the relevant provisions of the Companies 
(Amendment) Act, 1983.
 If Coinside receives acceptances of the Cash Offer in respect of, and/or otherwise acquires more than 50 
percent but less than 75 percent of the Aer Lingus shares to which the Cash Offer relates it intends (if 
necessary) to propose a resolution to cancel the listing of the Aer Lingus Shares on the Irish Stock 
Exchange and the UK Official List and, subject to such resolution being approved (which, under the Irish 
and UK Listing Rules, would require 75 percent approval), to apply for the cancellation of the listing of 
the Aer Lingus Shares on the Irish Stock Exchange and the UK Official List and for the cancellation of 
admission to trading of Aer Lingus Shares on the markets of the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock 
Exchange and it intends to propose a resolution to re-register Aer Lingus as a private company under the 
relevant provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983.
 If this de-listing and cancellation occurs, it will significantly reduce the liquidity and marketability 
of any Aer Lingus Shares not assented to the Cash Offer. It is anticipated that the cancellations will 
take effect no earlier than 20 Business Days from either the date Coinside has acquired 75 percent of the 
voting rights in Aer Lingus or on the first date of issue of compulsory acquisition notices by Coinside 
pursuant to Regulation 23 of the Takeover Regulations or, in the case of a resolution being required, no 
earlier than 20 Business Days from the date of passing of the resolution.

 OFT REFERS RYANAIR'S MINORITY STAKE IN AER LINGUS TO COMPETITION
 COMMISSION
The OFT today referred the completed acquisition by Ryanair Holdings plc of a minority stake in Aer Lingus 
Group plc to the Competition Commission for further investigation, due to competition concerns.
 The OFT commenced an investigation into Ryanair's stake of 29.8 per cent in Aer Lingus in October 2010. 
The OFT was legally unable to act prior to this date because Ryanair's bid for outright control of Aer 
Lingus was under review by the European Commission and European Courts. The OFT's investigation was also 
suspended on two occasions, once by the OFT because it had insufficient information with which to proceed, 
and once due to a legal challenge by Ryanair, which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 22 May 2012.
 The OFT has now concluded that Ryanair's stake may give it the ability to exercise material influence 
over the commercial policy of Aer Lingus and that there is a realistic prospect that its stake has 
resulted or will result in a substantial lessening of competition on a number of Ryanair and/or Aer Lingus 
routes between the UK and Ireland. The OFT therefore considers it appropriate for the Competition 
Commission to undertake a more detailed investigation into this matter.
 Ryanair and Aer Lingus are, by far, the two largest scheduled airlines operating between the UK and 
Ireland by passenger traffic.  They provide the only two scheduled airline services on five routes between 
the UK and Ireland and are the two most significant scheduled airline operators on the important London to 
Dublin route. Overall, around 370,000 scheduled air passengers travel between the UK and Ireland every 
month, with Ryanair and Aer Lingus together carrying over 80 per cent of these.
 The OFT has identified three principal competition concerns for UK passengers that may result from the 
minority stake and which require further detailed investigation:
 --    Ryanair's ability to weaken Aer Lingus as a competitor through use of its voting power at Aer 
Lingus shareholder meetings, for example through restricting Aer Lingus' funding opportunities, 
influencing how it uses key assets such as airport slots at London Heathrow, or blocking acquisitions 
above certain value thresholds.
Office of Fair Trading OFT refers Ryanair stake in Aer Lingus to CC
 --    Ryanair's shareholding may fetter Aer Lingus' options to benefit from investment by other airlines 
which may, in turn, weaken the competitive position of Aer Lingus over time including restricting its 
ability to expand and enter onto routes directly in competition with Ryanair.
 --    As a result of its shareholding, Ryanair's own incentives to compete against Aer Lingus may be 
dampened since it would be able to raise prices in the knowledge that a proportion of the profits of any 
lost passengers that switch to Aer Lingus would be recouped through its shareholding in Aer Lingus.
 Amelia Fletcher, OFT Chief Economist and Decision Maker in this case, said:
 'Ryanair and Aer Lingus are key rivals on routes between the UK and Ireland, together carrying over 80 
per cent of traffic. Competition between airlines benefits passengers, keeping fares down and increasing 
flight frequencies.
 'This OFT investigation has been into the acquisition of a minority stake in Aer Lingus. We are concerned 
that Ryanair's shareholding places it in a position to influence the commercial policy and strategy of Aer 
Lingus in a number of different ways that could dampen competition to the disadvantage of UK passengers. 
We therefore believe it is important for the Competition Commission to investigate this shareholding in 
more detail. The time that has elapsed since the acquisition took place does not make it any less 
important to passengers that our competition concerns are considered.'
 NOTES
 1.   Ryanair Holdings plc currently owns 29.82 per cent of Aer Lingus Group plc. Ryanair initially 
acquired a stake in Aer Lingus in late-2006. It mounted a public bid for the entire shareholding in Aer 
Lingus in October 2006. The European Commission investigated the public bid and decided to prohibit it in 
June 2007. The General Court ruled in July 2010 that the European Commission does not have the ability to 
examine or require divestment of minority shareholdings that do not confer 'decisive influence' for the 
purposes of the EU Merger Regulation. The OFT subsequently commenced a UK merger investigation (see press 
release OFT statement on its investigation of Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus (29 October 
2010)).
 2.   In January 2011, Ryanair appealed to the Competition Appeal Tribunal against the OFT's decision that 
it was 'in time' to investigate and refer, should it decide to do so, Ryanair's minority stake in Aer 
Lingus (see press release Ryanair minority stake in Aer Lingus: OFT believes it is 'in time' to consider 
acquisition (4 January 2011)). The Competition Appeal Tribunal delivered judgment in July 2011 that the 
OFT was in time to investigate Ryanair's acquisition of a minority stake in Aer Lingus (see press release 
OFT welcomes Competition Appeal Tribunal judgment in Ryanair/Aer Lingus merger case and The Competition 
Appeal Tribunal Judgment (28 July 2011)). In September 2011, Ryanair appealed the Competition Appeal 
Tribunal judgment to the Court of Appeal. In November 2011, the Court of Appeal stayed the OFT's 
investigation until the appeal had been determined. In May 2012 the Court of Appeal dismissed Ryanair's 
challenge to the Competition Appeal Tribunal judgment (see press release OFT statement on Court of Appeal 
judgment on Ryanair and Aer Lingus and The Court of Appeal Judgment (22 May 2012)). In June 2012, the 
Supreme Court denied Ryanair permission to appeal to it in respect of the Court of Appeal judgment.
 3.   Under the Enterprise Act 2002 a relevant merger situation is created if two or more enterprises have 
ceased to be distinct enterprises; and the value of the turnover in the United Kingdom of the enterprise 
being taken over exceeds GBP70 million; or as a result of the transaction, in relation to the supply of 
goods or services of any description, a 25 per cent share of supply in the UK (or a substantial part 
thereof) is created or enhanced.
 4.   Under the Enterprise Act 2002 the OFT may treat as a relevant merger situation a minority 
shareholding where that shareholding gives its owner the ability materially to influence the behaviour and 
policy of the target company including the target company's strategic direction and commercial objectives. 
As stated in the OFT's Mergers - jurisdictional and procedural guidance (OFT527, paragraph 3.15) this is a 
lower level of control than the 'decisive influence' test used by the European Commission under the EU 
Merger Regulation.
 5.   The reference test - the OFT has a duty to make a reference to the Competition Commission if it 
believes that it is or may be the case that a relevant merger situation has been created, and the creation 
of that situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition 
within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.
 6.   Timing. The Enterprise Act 2002 gives the OFT the power to suspend its statutory deadline in 
completed mergers if it is waiting for requested information from the merging parties to conduct its 
investigation. In this case, the statutory deadline was suspended between October 2010 and August 2011. 
Further, the Court of Appeal stayed the OFT's investigation from 24 November 2011 to 22 May 2012, at which 
point the OFT, Ryanair and Aer Lingus agreed a 15 working day extension to the OFT's deadline. The OFT's 
statutory deadline in this case is Monday 18 June 2012.
 7.   The Competition Commission is expected to report by 29 November 2012. It may extend the 24-week 
period within which it is required to publish its report by no more than eight weeks if it considers that 
there are special reasons why the report cannot be published within that period.
 8.   The full text of this decision will appear in the mergers section of this website at a later date.

 OFT decision to refer Ryanair's minority shareholding to the Competition Commission
 Dublin & London, 15 June 2012: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") welcomes today's decision by the 
Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") to refer Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus for detailed 
investigation by the Competition Commission under the UK's merger control legislation.
 Aer  Lingus' CEO, Christoph Mueller, said: "Today's decision by the OFT supports our view that Ryanair's 
shareholding in Aer Lingus is contrary to the interests of consumers and the majority of our shareholders.  
It is unacceptable that our principal competitor has been allowed to remain on our share register even 
though the European Commission blocked their hostile takeover almost five years ago.  We look forward to 
cooperating with the Competition Commission in its investigation which we are confident will result in 
Ryanair being ordered to dispose of its shareholding."

 RYANAIR WELCOMES UK COMPETITION COMMISSION REFERENCE
 CONFIDENT THAT CC WILL AGREE WITH EU COMMISSION, LEAVING RYANAIR'S SIX YEAR OLD MINORITY STAKE UNCHANGED
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline, today (15(th) June) welcomed the decision by the OFT to 
refer Ryanair's six year old minority (29%) stake in Aer Lingus to the UK Competition Commission for 
review.  Ryanair is confident that the CC will agree with the EU Commission which found in 2007 - over 
five years ago - that since Ryanair has neither "de facto or de jure control" in Aer Lingus, it should not 
be forced to sell down its 29% stake.
 Ryanair regrets this waste of public time and resources, and the UK OFT's continued wild goose chase into 
a six year old failed merger, when neither the Irish Competition authorities, nor the EU Commission, had 
any objection to Ryanair's 29% minority stake, which has conferred no influence or control upon Ryanair, 
since Aer Lingus has ignored Ryanair's advice and in a number of specific cases, denied Ryanair 
shareholder rights.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "We welcome the Competition Commission review of this six year old minority stake.  We are confident that 
the CC will find that since Ryanair has no control and no influence over Aer Lingus, the status quo will 
remain unchanged.
 "We continue to be critical of the remarkable contradiction between the OFT's recent acceptance of BA's 
takeover of British Midland (which the OFT declared that the EU Commission was "best placed" to rule on) 
or the OFT's earlier non-intervention in the Air France acquisition of a 25% stake in Alitalia, with its 
inexplicable attempt five years after the fact to investigate a failed merger between two Irish airlines, 
which has no material effect on UK aviation or UK consumers.  We do not believe that this is a sensible or 
useful expenditure of UK taxpayers' monies or resources, when this six year old 29% shareholding has no 
material effect on UK air travel, UK aviation or UK consumers."

 Aer Lingus response to decision by
 UK Supreme Court relating to OFT investigation into Ryanair's minority shareholding
 Dublin & London, 1 June 2012: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") welcomes today's refusal by the UK 
Supreme Court to grant Ryanair leave to appeal against the recent judgement by the Court of Appeal that 
the Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") is "in time" to investigate Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer 
Lingus under the UK's merger control legislation.  The Supreme Court's decision brings to an end Ryanair's 
challenge to the validity of the OFT's decision to commence its investigation into Ryanair's minority 
shareholding in September 2010.  The OFT can now proceed swiftly to complete its investigation into 
Ryanair's shareholding which is contrary to the interests of consumers and the majority of Aer Lingus' 
shareholders.

 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra low cost airline, today (22 May) confirmed that it had instructed its

claim that the UK OFT is "out of time" to investigate Ryanair's 6 year old 29% minority stake in Aer 
Lingus plc.
 Ryanair re-iterated that when the EU Commission prohibited Ryanair's takeover offer for Aer Lingus in 
June 2007, the Commission confirmed that Ryanair could not be forced to sell its 29% minority stake, since 
Ryanair did not have de facto or de jure control of Aer Lingus.  Ryanair's lawyers will immediately apply 
to appeal today's ruling to the UK Supreme Court and will be seeking a suspension of any OFT investigation 
pending an outcome of this Supreme Court appeal.

 RYANAIR CALLS FOR THE BREAK UP OF THE DAA MONOPOLY AND THE DEPT OF TRANSPORT AS DUBLIN  AIRPORT FAILS EU 
SECURITY STANDARDS
 THE DAA UNDER DOT CONTROL & PROTECTION SIMPLY ISN'T FIT FOR PURPOSE
 Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, today (15 May) called on Transport Minister
 Leo Varadkar to break-up the DAA monopoly and free it from the dead hand of the Dept of Transport (DOT) 
protection after Dublin airport failed to meet EU security standards, which means that all aircraft and 
passengers departing from Dublin airport must undergo similar security check at destination airports as if 
they were flying from Middle Eastern or third world countries with known security or terrorism risks.  All 
aircraft and passengers departing from Dublin may now undergo segregation and additional security checks 
upon arrival due to the failure of the DAA and its downtown office the Dept of Transport to comply with 
European security minima.
 This lamentable lack of adequate security at DAA Dublin airport, the five year record traffic declines at 
Dublin, Cork and Shannon, the waste of over EUR1bn wasted on unnecessary (largely empty) new terminals at 
Dublin, Cork and Shannon proves that neither the Dept of Transport or the DAA monopoly which it owns and 
protects are fit for purpose.  The DAA is an international embarrassment to Ireland.
 Ryanair has been vindicated in its long standing criticism of the DAA monopoly and the equally 
unimportant DOT. Ryanair believes the solution to these problems lies in breaking up the DAA and freeing 
it from the dead hand of the DOT by selling Shannon and Cork airports to the highest bidders (and using 
the proceeds to pay down govt debt) as well as selling off terminals 1 and 2 at Dublin to competing 
airport operators at a time when Edinburgh airport (with 9 m pax) was recently sold for almost EUR1bn.  
Competition between airports and terminals will deliver lower costs, traffic growth, improved passenger 
services and effective airport security where the DAA and DOT has patently failed.
 Ryanair also called on the Irish govt to confirm that all airlines and their passengers will be 
compensated directly by the DAA and the DOT for any additional costs or delays that they may suffer as as 
result of these additional (and totally avoidable) security costs on flights from Dublin.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said;
 "As a new Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to deliver 'change and reform', yet today's embarrassing 
security failure means that Irish passengers will once again be treated as second class citizens and/or

potential terrorists every time they land at other EU airports.  This is a totally unacceptable and yet 
avoidable failure by the DAA and the DOT.
 Since neither the DAA or the DOT are fit for purpose Minister Varadkar must now deliver real change and 
reform by breaking up the failed DAA monopoly, selling off its airports and terminals as well as overseas 
investments and using the proceeds to pay down some of Ireland's national debt.  At a time of recession 
and rising unemployment Ireland cannot afford the high cost, traffic declines, gold-plated facilities, or 
security mismanagement of the DAA and its equally incompetent down town office the Dept of Transport."

 RYANAIR CRITICISES PALTRY AER LINGUS DIVIDEND AS AN INSULT TO IRISH GOVT
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (4 May) welcomed Aer Lingus's decision to pay shareholders a 
dividend, which highlighted the Govt's continuing control over the Board and policies of Aer Lingus.  
Ryanair's call for a dividend over the past three years were repeatedly ignored and Ryanair was prevented 
from tabling a request for a dividend at last year's AGM, yet within weeks of Minister Leo Varadkar 
calling for a dividend, the Board of Aer Lingus has done as he requested and declared one.
 However, Ryanair condemned the proposed 3c per share dividend (EUR15.9m) as paltry and an insult to 
Minister Varadkar from a company with a gross cash pile of over EUR1bn and net cash balances of over 
EUR400m.  The Irish Govt will receive a dividend of less that EUR4m from Aer Lingus which will make no 
difference whatsoever to Govt finances.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said
 "Aer Lingus could easily afford a dividend of EUR50m which would generate EUR12.5m for Minister Varadkar 
while still leaving Aer Lingus with almost EUR1bn of gross cash, which the airline doesn't need since it 
has no aircraft orders, no material capital expenditures and no expansion plans.  Today's dividend of 3c 
per share is an insult to Minister Varadkar and the Irish Govt."

 RYANAIR STATEMENT ON ETIHAD'S 2.9%
 STAKE IN AER LINGUS - 1 MAY 2012
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Etihad's purchase of a 2.9% shareholding in Aer Lingus doesn't alter the future of Aer Lingus, which can 
only be decided when or if the Irish Government sells their 25% stake.  If this is sold to Etihad or to a 
financial investor, then it is inevitable that Aer Lingus will be broken up and some or all of its 
Heathrow slots lost to Ireland.
 "As our 7 Sept 2011 statement made clear, Ryanair will work with whomever the Government sells its 25% 
stake to (if it isn't sold to us), we would welcome any other financially strong airline/investor who 
acquires this stake, and who could then work with Ryanair and other shareholders to restore shareholder 
value, which has plunged by two thirds from over EUR3 to less than EUR1 per share currently under the 
existing Board."
 RYANAIR STATEMENT ON AER LINGUS - 7 SEPT 2011
 Ryanair today (7(th) September) responded to statements reportedly made by Minister for Transport, Leo 
Varadkar that the Government might consider a disposal of its non strategic 25% shareholding in Aer 
Lingus.
 Ryanair wishes to confirm the following:
 1.   If the Irish Govt wishes to dispose of its 25% stake in Aer Lingus, and if the Govt believes that 
any offer from Ryanair for this stake would be unwelcome, then Ryanair is happy to confirm that it will 
not bid for the Govt's 25% stake (although this may result in the Govt realising a lower price for its 
shares).
 2.   Ryanair would welcome another financially strong airline/investor acquiring the Govt's 25% stake, 
which could then work with Ryanair and other like minded shareholders to restore shareholder value, which 
has been destroyed over the past five years by the Board and Management of Aer Lingus.
 3.   Should another financially strong airline/investor acquire the Govt's 25% stake, Ryanair would not 
rule out entering into discussions with that party for the subsequent disposal of Ryanair's near 30% stake 
subject to an acceptable agreement on price and maximising shareholder value.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR STATEMENT ON ETIHAD'S 2.9% STAKE IN AER L
 Ryanair will not engage in, or comment upon, rumour or speculation, but remains willing to work with any 
other Aer Lingus shareholders to maximise shareholder value which has under the current Board of Aer 
Lingus collapsed by more than 80% from over EUR3.00 per share in early 2007 to less than EUR0.60 per share 
in recent days.

 AENA ALICANTE LOSES 236,000 PASSENGERS IN 5 MONTHS FOLLOWING AIRBRIDGES DISPUTE WITH 
RYANAIR
 Ryanair, Spain's favourite airline, today (24 Apr) released details of AENA Alicante's record traffic losses from 
November 2011 to March 2012, covering the first 5 month period since Ryanair cut its flights and schedules at 
Alicante in response to AENA's imposition of unnecessary airbridge use, and increased Ryanair's charges at 
Alicante Airport.  These figures show that AENA Alicante has lost a record 236,000 passengers in the last 5 months 
(an avg of 47,000 per month) and while Ryanair accounts for 204,000 of this traffic loss, Alicante's other airlines 
have also cut their traffic by over 32,000 passengers.

Ryanair Holdings PLC AENA ALICANTE LOSES 236,000 PASSENGERS IN 5 MONTHS
Contrary to AENA Alicante's previous claims that "other airlines" would make up the loss of Ryanair 
traffic, AENA Alicante and its high charges are turning away not just Ryanair's low fare passengers, but 
also the traffic of other airlines.  Ryanair called again on AENA Alicante to reverse its decision to 
impose unnecessary airbridges on Ryanair and other airlines who don't want to use these them.  While AENA 
Alicante is losing routes, passengers and income, Ryanair continues to grow at other Spanish and EU 
airports, where there is no obligation to use airbridges, since there airbridges are not a safety item.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "Ryanair predicted that AENA Alicante would lose traffic and jobs as a result of these unnecessary 
airbridges and airbridge fees, whereas AENA claimed that other airlines would make up for Ryanair's 
traffic loss.  What these figures show is that AENA has lost more than 200,000 Ryanair passengers in 5 
months, but also a further 30,000 passengers from other airlines.
 "This is another example of AENA mismanaging Alicante Airport.  Routes, passengers and jobs are being 
lost solely because AENA wants to impose unnecessary airbridge use and fees on low cost airlines at 
Alicante who don't wish to use them.
 "It is not too late for Alicante to withdraw this airbridge policy and allow Ryanair to return to walk 
on/walk off boarding procedures which applied to all Ryanair flights at Alicante from 2007 until 2011.  If 
they don't, then AENA Alicante will continue to lose routes, traffic and jobs through their own 
mismanagement."

 "Ryanair welcomes the sale of Edinburgh Airport, which will free it from the dead hand of the high cost 
BAA monopoly.  Ryanair looks forward to working with the new owners of Edinburgh to lower costs and grow 
traffic and routes.
 The sale of Edinburgh now clears the way for the final sale of Stansted, which the BAA monopoly has been 
delaying since the Competition Commission first recommended the sale in 2006.  While the BAA has been 
delaying the sale of Stansted they have doubled Stansted's charges and driven its traffic down from 24m 
passengers to less than 18m passengers last year."

 signs of tentative expansion.
Portfolio activity
 In general, the allocation of capital at a sector level was more successful
 than stock selection. The portfolio had a small average net cash position
 during the period, which harmed returns when compared with the broader market.
Stock selection in the oil & gas and industrials sectors detracted from returns
 when compared to the broader market. A holding in Galp Energia, a Portuguese
 company, produced negative returns towards the end of 2011. Although we felt
 that the core business remained resilient with attractive production growth
 rates in the coming years, the company's share price fell as the price achieved
 for the disposal of strategically-valuable assets in Brazil did not meet the
 market's expectations. In addition, the decision not to own a holding in oil
 major Total for the majority of the period, instead favouring oil services
 companies, hurt returns as the company benefited from a rising oil price.
 Positions in Russian oil pipeline operator, Transneft, and Italian energy
 producer, Eni, also underperformed the broader market during the period.
Elsewhere within the portfolio, the Company's performance was hindered by
 holdings in higher-quality defensive companies in the food producers industry,
 including Nestlé and Danone, which underperformed as investors aggressively
 re-allocated towards more cyclical names at the beginning of 2012. On the same
 theme, the decision not to own positions in chemicals companies Bayer and BASF
BlackRock Grtr Eur Half-yearly Report -2-
 at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012 harmed the Company's performance as
 the sector rallied strongly.
On a more positive note, many of the most successful individual stock positions
 proved to be, in general, relatively stable businesses with a high degree of
 exposure to international growth markets. This included Danish pharmaceutical
 company, Novo Nordisk, which we believe continues to offer one of the highest
 growth rates in its sector with attractive exposure to structural growth in
 insulin demand, both within developed and emerging markets, and market-leading
 products. Elsewhere, a position in Dutch food retailer, Ahold, benefited from
 its exposure to the US markets which showed encouraging signs for 2012 growth
 at the end of 2011.
Stock selection within the consumer services sector also proved successful,
 with a holding in Irish airline, Ryanair, being one of the best performing
 stocks in the portfolio during the period. Positions in software services
 company, SAP, and semiconductor manufacturer, Infineon Technologies, both
 performed well for the Company. SAP continued to outperform during the period,
 benefiting from strong new products and attractive growth in both the US and
 emerging markets. Infineon's share price rose as its cost cutting plan allowed
 the potential for strong margin expansion; the stock also benefited from the
 continuation of strong automotive demand, with close to 50% of Infineon's sales
 coming from its automotive division.
The portfolio's sector allocation, lower weightings in telecoms and utilities,
 strongly contributed to relative returns as the sectors significantly
 underperformed the market. Our stance on the telecoms sector is based on the
 view that many of the companies do not offer attractive growth potential and
 may be exposed to dividend cuts given the relatively high yield offered by the
 sector. We have also avoided the utilities sector which offers relatively low
 growth in the domestic European markets. Often labelled 'defensive' areas of
 the market, both the telecoms and utilities sectors also suffered on a relative
 basis from a significant increase in investor risk appetite at the beginning
 of 2012.
The weighting in Russia fell during the period. This reflected our view that,
 despite a high oil price, the local market in late 2011 was not fully reflecting
 the increased political and economic risks that Russia is facing. That said,
 with several companies currently trading at close to distressed valuations,
 significant opportunities are presenting themselves once again.
At the end of the period, the portfolio was particularly weighted towards
 positions in the consumer goods and consumer services sectors. Within these
 sectors, the portfolio had a focus on higher quality, globally exposed
 companies with a stronger brand and generally higher growth rates than the rest
 of the sector. The portfolio has lower exposure to the financials sector, which
BlackRock Grtr Eur Half-yearly Report -2-
 we continue to view as subject to negative loan growth in parts of Europe,
 higher demands from regulators and higher exposure to the sovereign debt issues
 in the periphery of Europe. The portfolio also had higher weightings in
 the oil & gas, basic materials and health care sectors, was neutral
 industrials when compared with the broader market, and had lower weightings in
 the telecoms and utilities sectors.
Outlook
 Our outlook for the region remains positive in the long term. Following
 February's second LTRO, we maintain that progress towards a resolution of the
 European sovereign debt issues will continue to shape investor sentiment and
 markets are likely to remain volatile. However, investors are pricing in a
 significant risk premium for the current political and economic uncertainties
 and we believe our strategy of building positions in the long term winners -
 companies with highly differentiated business models, strong balance sheets and
 structural growth driven largely by international demand - will deliver
 attractive returns over the medium term.

Ten Largest Investments
 29 February 2012
Novo Nordisk - 5.3% (2011: 4.6%) is a Danish pharmaceuticals company and the
 dominant global franchise in diabetes treatment. The company has high levels of
 market share in Asia ex-Japan, which is a rapidly growing market for insulin
 demand, and we believe that the company has the most attractive pipeline of
 short and long term acting insulin products on the market.
Nestlé - 5.0% (2011: 5.6%) is a Swiss company engaged in the nutrition, health
 and wellness sectors. Nestlé has one of the world's leading product and brand
 portfolios offering consistent, structural growth. The company has achieved
 organic sales growth of more than 4% per year in 20 of the last 22 years and is
 a high quality stable growth company. Nestlé also offers strong free cash flow
 generation and has maintained or increased dividend payments every year since
 1959.
Roche - 4.2% (2011: nil) is a Swiss pharmaceuticals and diagnostics company
 with global exposure. Roche has gone through a strong period of growth but has
 now transitioned to focusing on profitability and improving shareholder
 returns. The company has the ability to improve productivity and cut costs
 whilst trading on an attractive valuation given its double-digit earnings
 growth profile.
Allianz - 4.1% (2011: nil) is a German based financial services provider, which
BlackRock Grtr Eur Half-yearly Report -2-
 predominantly provides insurance services. Allianz commands strong market
 positions and is relatively well capitalised to mitigate the risk of any asset
 write-downs. The operational performance in the company's non-life division is
 improving and the company offers relatively strong cash generation, supporting
 its attractive dividend yield.
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton - 3.8% (2011: 4.6%) is a French luxury goods
 company with exposure to the global high-end consumer. The company owns a
 number of highly regarded luxury brands in five main areas: wines and spirits,
 perfumes and cosmetics, watches and jewellery, fashion and leather goods and
 selective retailing. The company offers attractive exposure to consumption
 growth in some of the fastest growing markets in the world and enjoys strong
 profitability due to the strength of its branding and the quality of its
 product line-up.
Ahold - 3.8% (2011: nil) is a Dutch listed supermarket retailer. The company
 has some exposure in the Netherlands but also has a significant franchise in
 the US. Ahold is very cash-flow generative, which offers the ability for the
 company to perform share buybacks and offer a high dividend yield. The company
 is also cheaper than many of its peers with higher earnings growth potential
 and may benefit from a strengthening US dollar.
Syngenta - 3.7% (2011: 2.9%) is a Swiss agribusiness company operating in the
 crop protection and seeds businesses. The company's crop protection division,
 in which it has high market share, benefits from farmers looking to maximise
 yields and is a high quality, cash-generative business operating in an industry
 with high barriers to entry. We believe the company will continue to benefit
 from rising volumes and increasing margin expansion ahead of market
 expectations.
Eni - 3.6% (2011: nil) is an Italian oil & gas exploration and production
 company. The company is set to benefit from strong demand for exploration and
 production in emerging markets as well as a corporate restructuring programme.
 The company also offers the highest dividend yield in the European large-cap
 oil & gas sector and is likely to benefit from its strong balance sheet in
 uncertain conditions.
Anheuser-Busch - 3.1% (2011: 1.9%) is a Belgian beverage company. The company
 owns, produces and distributes over 200 beer brands across the world, with a
 high degree of strategic emerging market exposure and a quality management
 team. The company offers an attractive growth profile, especially through its
 Brazilian business and may benefit from efficiency improvements in the US.
Pernod Ricard - 3.1% (2011: 2.6%) is a French listed global producer and
 distributor of wine and spirit brands. The company offers a significant level
 of sales exposure to higher growth emerging markets, with high double-digit
BlackRock Grtr Eur Half-yearly Report -2-
 growth in these markets during 2011. The company's brand portfolio is very
 strong and offers the ability to benefit from wealth creation in these high

 RYANAIR CALLS ON EU COMMISSION TO STOP ATC STRIKES, AS THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS ARE HIJACKED BY FRENCH ATC 
STRIKES.
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline today (3 April) called on the EU Commission to prevent millions of 
Europe's citizens having their flights cancelled or delayed, by tiny numbers of French Air Traffic 
Controllers going on strike again this week.  Ryanair condemned the EU Commission's continuing failure to 
act on its repeated call for the removal of the right to strike from Europe's air traffic controllers, who 
repeatedly blackmail Europe's passengers with strikes throughout the summer season.  Ryanair pointed out 
that many of Europe's police forces and army personnel are not allowed to strike.  Air traffic controllers 
in the USA are also prevented by law from striking, which means that the skies over the US cannot be 
closed or hijacked by ATC strikes or work to rule. The European Commission should apply similar no strike 
rules here in Europe.
 Ryanair confirmed that yesterday's French Air Traffic Control strike caused 134 flights to be cancelled, 
with a further 450 flights delayed, resulting in 88,000 Ryanair passengers having their flights disrupted 
on Monday through no fault of theirs or Ryanair.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "It is unacceptable that the skies over Europe are repeatedly closed or flights delayed by the 
unjustified strike action of tiny numbers of air traffic controllers.  These public servants are among the 
most overpaid and protected in Europe and yet they repeatedly opt for the strike weapon as a first, rather 
than a last resort. The summer schedules in Europe are barely one week old and already the French Air 
Traffic Controllers are engaged in three days of strikes.  The solution to this problem is simple, remove 
their right to strike in exactly the same way that Air Traffic Controllers in the USA are prevented by law 
from striking
 "The EU Commission should stop talking about taking action and finally do something about these repeated 
and unacceptable strikes by removing the right to strike from ATC unions".

 RYANAIR CONDEMNS EU COMMISSION BIAS AS BRUSSELS RUBBER-STAMPS BA'S TAKEOVER OF BMI, WHILE BLOCKING 
RYANAIR'S 2006 OFFER FOR AER LINGUS
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (30(th) March) condemned the European Commission's 
discriminatory application of competition rules in the airline sector, as the EU Commission rubber-stamped 
IAG/BA's acquisition of BMI British Midland from Lufthansa, which further concentrates BA's power and 
control over the heavily congested London Heathrow slots.  BA/IAG's share of Heathrow slots will as a 
result of this rubber-stamped merger rise from 45% to some 55%.
 Ryanair noted that this merger which has been approved in Phase 1 by the Commission, is yet another in 
the long list of EU flag carrier mergers which have been rubber-stamped and approved by the EU Commission.  
These mergers involving BA/ Iberia/ BMI; Air France/KLM/Alitalia and Lufthansa/Austrian/Swiss/SN Brussels 
account for well over 50% of all EU passenger journeys.  Ryanair finds it remarkable that while every 
major flag carrier merger has been rubber-stamped by the EU Commission over the last 20 years, Ryanair's 
2006 offer for Aer Lingus, an airline which accounts for less than 1% of EU air travel, is the only 
significant EU airline merger that was prohibited, yet a merger of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would account 
for less than 50% of Dublin Airport's current 35MPPA capacity.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Today's rubber-stamping of BA's purchase of BMI from Lufthansa, shows yet again that the EU Commission 
has one rule for Europe's flag carriers, but different rules for Ryanair.  While we have no objection to 
BA's acquisition of BMI, it will undoubtedly lead to higher fares and higher fuel surcharges, and give 
BA/IAG even greater control (over 55% of slots) at the heavily congested London-Heathrow.  It also exposes 
again, the Commission's discrimination against Ryanair in its 2006 prohibition of our offer for Aer 
Lingus, an airline which accounts for less than 1% of EU air travel and where Ryanair and Aer Lingus 
combined would have less than 50% of the total capacity at Dublin Airport, an airport which is now 
operating just over half of its available (35MPPA) capacity.
 "While the European Commission was rushing through its rubber-stamping of BA's purchase of BMI British 
Midland, it has again failed to take any action to require illegal State Aid to be repaid by Europe's flag 
carriers including Air France, Alitalia, Malev and more recently Spanair.
 "Whether its state aid or merger policy, the European Commission clearly has a set of rules for flag 
carriers and a different set for Ryanair".

 NOTICE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING
 Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair" or the "Company") announces  today (28 March) that it has published a circular to 
shareholders ("Circular") convening an extraordinary general meeting of the Company ("EGM"). The EGM will be 
held at 9.00 a.m. on 19 April, 2012 at The Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport, Co. Dublin, Ireland. A copy of the 
Circular is available on the Company's website at www.ryanair.com. The Circular has also been filed with the Irish 
Stock Exchange and with the United Kingdom Listing Authority's National Storage Mechanism and will shortly be 
available at:
 Company Announcements Office
 Irish Stock Exchange
 28 Anglesea Street
 Dublin
 Ireland; and at
 www.hemscott.com/nsm.do
 Two resolutions are proposed for consideration at the EGM. Resolution 1 is a proposal, (announced as part of the 
Company's Q3 Results issued on 30 January, 2012), to amend the Company's 5% share buy back authority in 
order to accommodate the possible repurchase of ordinary shares held in ADS form. Resolution 2 relates to the 
proposal by the Company to reclassify its listing on the Official List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority from a 
premium listing to a standard listing in order to facilitate such ADS repurchases. The Company's Ordinary Shares 
will continue to be traded on the main market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange and the Company 
will also retain its primary listing on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange which will ensure that all the current 
shareholder protections and corporate governance requirements remain applicable. Ryanair will also retain its 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of EGM
listing on NASDAQ, in ADS form (American Depositary Shares). It is not expected that this change in listing will 
have any impact on trading or liquidity in any of the three markets on which Ryanair securities are traded.
 Further information in relation to both Resolutions (which are inter-conditional) is contained in the Circular.
 The expected timetable of events is as follows:
Date of issue of the Circular                      28 March, 2012
 Latest time and date for receipt      9.00 a.m. on 17 April, 2012
 of Forms of Proxy for use at the
 Extraordinary General Meeting
 Extraordinary General Meeting         9.00 a.m. on 19 April, 2012
 Expected date upon which the change                  21 May, 2012
 in listing category in the UK
 will become effective
Defined terms in the Circular have the same meaning as in this announcement.

 RYANAIR DEFERS AER LINGUS LEGAL ACTION,
 AS AER LINGUS CEO RULES OUT PENSION FUND TOP-UP
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, and a 29.8% shareholder in Aer Lingus, today (8(th) Mar '12) 
instructed its lawyers to postpone any further legal action against Aer Lingus plc, to prevent Aer Lingus 
making any top up contributions to its defined contribution pension schemes, following the unequivocal and 
public assurances made by Aer Lingus CEO Mr Christoph Mueller during the company's annual results last 
week (see http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2012/0229/1224312523193.html - Irish Times, 29(th) 
Feb).
 Mr Mueller has, on behalf of Aer Lingus, ruled out any pension fund top-up, and also confirmed that Aer 
Lingus' participation in recent Labour Relations Commission talks was "through a moral obligation to the 
employees, more than anything else".
 Ryanair welcomes this definitive and unequivocal assurance by Aer Lingus to its shareholders and staff 
that it will not make any further contributions to its pension schemes over and above its existing fixed 
contribution rates, and believes that all Aer Lingus shareholders will take comfort from Mr Mueller's 
unequivocal assurances.
 Ryanair has advised Aer Lingus that should the company or management attempt to resile from this 
unequivocal position concerning its defined contribution pension schemes, then Ryanair will restart its 
legal action against Aer Lingus in order to protect the interests of all Aer Lingus' shareholders and 
prevent these funds being wasted yet again by Aer Lingus on further contributions to Aer Lingus' DC 
pension schemes.

 RYANAIR CALLS ON OFT TO EXPLAIN WHY EU COMMISSION IS "BEST PLACED" TO CONSIDER THE BA/BMI DEAL, BUT OFT 
WANTS TO REOPEN FIVE YEAR OLD EU COMMISSION'S DECISION ON THE 6 YEAR OLD FAILED RYANAIR/AER LINGUS DEAL
 Ryanair, the UK's favourite airline today (8(th) March) called on the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to 
explain their decision this week not to ask the European Commission to refer the BA/BMI merger back to the 
OFT for assessment, which runs contrary to the OFT's previous decision to attempt to review the European 
Commission's ruling on Ryanair's failed 2006 offer for Aer Lingus, which the OFT is attempting to 
investigate, despite the fact that it is out of time to do so.
 Ryanair also called on the OFT to explain why it now admits that the European Commission is "best placed 
to assess the (BA/BMI) deal", yet when the European Commission previously ruled that Ryanair would not be 
required to sell its 29% stake in Aer Lingus, the OFT decided in 2010, four years after the event, that it 
wished to investigate this decision, when it now admits that the European Commission "is best placed" to 
assess these issues.
 As usual, the OFT applies one rule (or rather a blind eye) when British Airways is acquiring other UK 
airlines, yet wishes to apply a different rule to a six year old failed merger between two Irish airlines 
which has little if any competition implications in the UK marketplace.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "The OFT now admits that the European Commission is "best placed" to consider these airline mergers, and 
as a result, the OFT has decided not to review BA's acquisition of British Midland.  Given this admission, 
the OFT and its Irish boss John Fingleton should explain precisely why six years after Ryanair's failed 
takeover of an Irish airline, Aer Lingus, was prohibited by the European Commission, it now wishes to re-
investigate the European Commission's decision not to force Ryanair to dispose of its 29% stake in Aer 
Lingus.  This is a glaring waste of regulatory time and resources by Mr Fingleton, the UK's most expensive 
(Irish) civil servant.
 "Perhaps Mr Fingleton might now explain why the European Commission is best placed to assess BA's 
takeover of BMI, when he and his office do not accept that the EU was also best placed to assess Ryanair's 
failed offer for Aer Lingus.
 "This decision by the OFT demonstrates yet again that there is one rule for British Airways and a 
different rule for Ryanair.  The OFT under John Fingleton lacks any independence or integrity when it 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CALLS FOR OFT EXPLANATION RE BA/BMI DEAL
comes to Ryanair and it should now accept the EU Commission's ruling on Ryanair's failed offer for Aer 
Lingus and stop wasting time and British money reviewing the EU's ruling when they now admit that the EU 
is best placed to review these deals."

Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results
Note 1:    Adjusted profit after tax and EPS during the half year ended 30 September 2005 excludes a 
receipt, net of tax, of EUR5.2m arising from the settlement of an insurance claim for the scribing of 6 
Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
 Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "These record traffic and profits reflect the continued successful roll-out of Ryanair's lowest fare 
model despite difficult trading conditions characterised by record high fuel prices and intense 
competition.  It also demonstrates the robustness of the Ryanair model, which delivers significant profits 
and passenger growth even during turbulent periods while many competitors are losing money.
 "As anticipated, yields were 3% higher than last year despite a 29% increase in seat capacity.  These 
slightly higher yields reflect the multiple fuel surcharges imposed by European flag carriers, which have 
continued to widen the gap between their high fares and Ryanair's lowest fares.  We have again reaffirmed 
our commitment not to impose fuel surcharges on our passengers and reaped the benefits of this strategy in 
terms of significant traffic growth and slightly higher yields during the half year.  Ancillary revenues 
grew by 40% significantly faster than the growth in passenger volumes and this year we expect that they 
will continue to outpace passenger growth.
 "Unit costs increased by 8% primarily due to higher fuel costs.  Excluding fuel all other unit costs were 
reduced by 7% thanks to the addition of more lower cost and efficient Boeing 737-800's, new lower cost 
airport and base agreements and continuing tight control over all other cost lines.  We continue to focus 
aggressively on costs and anticipate that the cost reductions achieved will continue to partially offset 
the significantly higher oil prices.
 "Our fuel costs rose by 108% to EUR237m as we were unhedged for almost the entire half year.   For the 
remainder of this fiscal year, to March 2006, we are 90% hedged at rates equivalent to $49 per barrel.  We 
are unhedged thereafter but continue to closely monitor forward prices with a view to hedging our 
requirements for summer of 2006.  However, we expect that fuel prices will continue at these higher levels 
for some time.
 "Our new routes and bases have performed well over the summer with Luton and Liverpool performing 
strongly whilst yields at Shannon continue to be lower than expected.  We recently commenced operations at 
Pisa, our 13(th) European base, in October with 10 routes, and announced our 14(th) base at Nottingham - 
East Midlands which will open in March 2006 with two based aircraft and a total of 15 routes.  We achieved 
a significant milestone during August by carrying more passengers on our shorthaul European network than 
British Airways did on their entire worldwide network in one month.
 "During the half year, we exercised 14 Boeing 737-800 options for delivery in 2007, at which date we plan 
to sell on 5 older Boeing 737-800's delivered in 1999.  This is a continuation of our strategy of 
operating the youngest fleet in Europe with the lowest unit operating costs and delivering the best on 
time performance.  At our recent investor day conference Management highlighted that we plan to double 
passenger volumes and profits by 2012 and believe that we are still now in the early stages of low fare 
development in Europe.  The exercise of these net 9 options is part of our strategy to continue to 
increase seat capacity to satisfy the growing demand for Ryanair's low fares.
 "We continue to fight the levy of unjust taxes on our passengers and we welcome the recent announcement 
by the UK government that it would not impose a GBP1 tax on air tickets.  This GBP1 tax was proposed by 
the CAA to cover their own failure to ensure that scheduled airlines had adequate financial resources to 
fly to and from the UK.  We also oppose the GBP4bn BAA farce at Stansted Airport where the BAA airport 
monopoly propose to build facilities that the users at the airport unanimously oppose, as they are 
extravagant and over specified.  The objective of this inflated proposal is to ensure that the BAA airport 
monopoly can claim a higher return on this GBP4bn of capital expenditure rather than the GBP400m to 
GBP600m, which more accurately reflects the cost of the facilities that the user airlines actually want 
them to build.
 "In Ireland the recent decision by the Commission for Aviation Regulation to allow Dublin Airport to 
increase airport charges by 23% from January next to pay for a proposed 2(nd) terminal, 5 years before it 
is built and without any consultation with the airline users (despite previous government assurances) is 
beyond belief.  We now have the bizarre situation that an over specified future airport development is 
being funded by increasing charges now even though not a sod has been turned on the facility, and there is 
no plan for it to be turned for quite some time.
 "We continue to remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.  We anticipate that 
the fare differentials between Ryanair and the flag carriers will be partially eroded as the fuel 
surchargers are forced to lower their underlying fares to compete with Ryanair's lower prices.  We expect 
to achieve significant increases in passenger's volumes but also anticipate that yields in Q3 will be 
broadly in line with last year and Q4 yields will fall by a range of -5% to -10%, as previously guided.  
Our full year net profit guidance is unchanged.  This winter we expect that there will be continued 
intense competition and there will be fewer low fare carriers in the market as higher fuel prices force 
more carriers out of the industry.  Ryanair's combination of the lowest fare in every market, our lowest 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results
cost base and industry leading customer service will enable us to grow across Europe to the benefit of our 
passengers, our people and our shareholders".

Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the 
airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and Continental Europe, the general 
willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political factors.
 Ryanair is Europe's largest low fares airline with 15 bases and 266 low fare routes across 21 countries.  By the end 
of March 2006 Ryanair will operate an entire fleet of 107 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft with firm orders for a further 
127 new aircraft (net of planned disposals), which will be delivered over the next 7 years.  Ryanair currently 
employs a team of 3,000 people and expects to carry approximately 35 million scheduled passengers in the current 
year.

 Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Wednesday, 2(nd) November 2005) launched the last FREE* Seat 
Sale of 2005 to celebrate beating Easyjet's on-time performance every week for the last 3 years.

on-time performance and consistently offered fares that are 50% cheaper.
 "Ryanair's superior punctuality record which is verified by the CAA shows that not alone will our passengers fly for 
50% less than Easyjet's high fares, but they will also be much more likely to arrive on time if they fly with Ryanair.
 "To celebrate stuffing Easy-"To-Be-Late"-Jet 3 years in a row we are launching a 2 M FREE* Seat Sale all over 
Europe on www.ryanair.com from today until midnight of Thursday, 10(th) November 2005. This is the last FREE*

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCE RECORD Q.1 RESULTS
 NET PROFIT RISES 80% TO EUR116m - TRAFFIC GROWS 25% TO 10.7m
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (August 1, 2006) announced record profits of EUR115.7m for its 
first Quarter ended June 30, 2006.  Traffic grew by 25% to 10.7m passengers, yields increased 13%, ancillary 
revenues climbed 31%, and consequently total revenues rose by 40% to EUR566.6m.  Unit costs excluding fuel fell 
by 2% (including fuel they rose by 6%) as fuel costs rose by 52% to EUR167.5m.  The increase in profitability 
boosted cash balances which rose by EUR212.4m to EUR2.18bn.  As a result, Ryanair's adjusted after tax margin 
for the Quarter rose by 4 points to 20% as Q.1 Adjusted Net Profit increased by a record 80% to EUR115.7m.

 Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "These bumper Q.1 profits - which were strongly signalled at the time of our full year results in June - 
reflect a much stronger yield environment despite substantially higher oil prices.  We would caution 
however, based on advanced bookings, that we do not expect this yield buoyancy to be maintained at similar 
levels during the second quarter or indeed the second half of the fiscal year.  The underlying causes of 
these stronger Q.1 yields was primarily the presence of Easter in the quarter (and its absence from the 
prior year comparable), many more "sun" destinations, the impact of competitors fuel surcharges which 
continue to drive traffic towards Ryanair, the initial impact of our baggage charging initiative, and the 
earlier launch of our new bases and routes, much of which took place in the fourth quarter last year.
 We are pleased that ancillary revenues grew by 31% from an already significant base, as the growth of 
ancillary sales continues to outpace that of scheduled traffic. As we stimulate further traffic growth 
with lower fares, we find that passengers are more willing to spend some of their savings on additional 
products and services such as car hire, hotels and travel insurance.
 Our new bases at Liverpool, East Midlands and Shannon continue to perform well, with strong bookings over 
the Summer months, albeit that fares at Shannon continue to be lower than expected.  We plan to announce 
two new bases over the coming months with launch dates in early 2007, as well as further expansion of our 
existing bases.
 During the quarter fuel costs rose by 52% to EUR167.5m.  Excluding fuel unit costs fell by 2% as we 
continue to aggressively manage costs in all other areas.  Fuel prices continue to be high and volatile.  
We have recently extended our hedging position, so that we are 90% hedged to the end of October at $70 per 
barrel and 90% hedged for November and December at $74 per barrel.  Thereafter we remain unhedged for the 
January to March 2007 quarter, but we continue to monitor forward rates and will try to avail of any 
suitable opportunity to hedge out our outstanding requirement for the fiscal year.
 During the quarter we exercised options for delivery of ten further Boeing 737-800 series aircraft in 
2008.  The addition of these new aircraft will enable us to continue to drive down our aircraft and 
operating costs.  The penetration of web based check-in continues to improve with some flights achieving 
50% of web check-in.  We will aggressively promote web check-in and priority boarding for passengers 
travelling with hand luggage.   We intend to continue to exploit initiatives such as web check-in to 
reduce our costs, whilst at the same time providing passengers with superior service such as avoiding 
check-in queues and priority boarding.
 We strongly welcome the take-over of the BAA airport monopoly by Ferrovial and look forward to their 
review of plans and costings for the second runway at Stansted.  We anticipate that this review will 
confirm that a second runway and terminal can be built at a more realistic cost of GBP1bn, rather than the 
GBP4bn gold plated Taj Mahal proposed by the BAA airport monopoly.  The Ferrovial takeover highlighted 
that the BAA were able to fund a GBP1bn "pay-off" to its shareholders just three months after it was 
telling the CAA Regulator that "it couldn't afford" to pay for the second terminal at Stansted without 
doubling passenger charges.  This revelation should encourage the Regulator to take a much more sceptical 
approach to the BAA's submissions and finalise a regulatory review which meets the needs of users rather 
than  featherbedding the BAA's monopoly profits.  We also welcome the OFT probe into the present monopoly 
ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. Monopolies don't work and don't serve the needs of 
consumers.  Real competition between these three airports will lead to lower airport charges and better 
facilities for passengers, and Ryanair will continue to strongly campaign for the break-up of the BAA 
airport monopoly, which has for many years delivered high passenger charges and abysmal facilities at the 
London airports.
 Our outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year remains cautious.  As we emphasised at the time of our 
full year results in June, we expected a bumper set of Q.1 results, and a strong second quarter, but we 
believe that the forthcoming Winter will be characterised by much more difficult trading conditions.  
Ryanair will increase its fleet by 27 aircraft this Winter (compared to last year's net increase of just 
15) during which we will launch many more new routes and bases.  This combination of substantial Winter 
capacity expansion, higher oil prices (now $74 per barrel compared to our original forecast of $70) and 
price dumping by loss making competitors will mean another very difficult Winter trading period and if oil 
prices are higher than $74, we may even sustain losses during the fourth quarter this year.  Based on our 
current fuel hedges and the forward price of oil for the unhedged quarter, we anticipate that the increase 
in net profit after tax for the fiscal year will still be within the range of our previous guidance of +5% 
to +10% increase and that almost all of these profits will be generated in Q.1 and Q.2, with a consequent 
reduction in profitability during Q.3 and Q.4 compared to last year.
 We remain on target to achieve our objective of becoming the world's largest international scheduled 
airline by passenger traffic, whilst at the same time growing profitability and reducing costs for the 
benefit of our passengers, our people and our shareholders.  We continue to believe that this growth in 
traffic and profits will be achieved thanks to Ryanair's unique combination of lowest costs, lowest fares 
and industry leading customer service".

Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the 
airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and Continental Europe, the general 
willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political factors.
 Ryanair is Europe's largest low fares airline with 16 bases and 351 low fare routes across 23 countries.  By March 
2007 Ryanair will operate an entire fleet of 134 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft with firm orders for a further 115 new 
aircraft, which will be delivered over the next 6 years.  Ryanair currently employs a team of 3,700 people and 
expect to carry approximately 42 million scheduled passengers in the current year.

 Ryanair announces that the Offer Document to Aer Lingus shareholders will be posted on Monday, 23 October 
2006.
 A Ryanair statement outlining the key elements of the Offer Document is set out below.
 The Board of Ryanair Holdings plc announced today (Friday, 20 October 2006) that the Offer Document will 
be published and posted to Aer Lingus shareholders on Monday next, 23 October 2006.   On 5 October 2006, 
Ryanair announced a Cash Offer of EUR2.80 per Aer Lingus Share, which values Aer Lingus at approximately 
EUR1.48bn, significantly higher than the EUR1.16bn IPO value of just 8 days previously.
 Speaking today, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair believes that its Cash Offer represents excellent value for Aer Lingus Shareholders and offers 
significant attractions to Aer Lingus' stakeholders.   This Offer represents a unique opportunity to form 
one strong Irish airline group with over 50 million passengers per annum, capable of competing against the 
three European mega carriers. Ryanair's strategy will be to expand, enhance and upgrade Aer Lingus' 
operations. Without Ryanair, Aer Lingus will continue to be a small regional European airline which, 
because of its size and regional nature, is unlikely to be of interest or relevance to the three major 
European airline groupings.
 Excellent Value for Aer Lingus Shareholders
 --      27% Premium on IPO
 On 27 September 2006, the Government of Ireland, Aer Lingus and their respective advisers determined that 
EUR2.20 was an appropriate price at which to issue and sell Aer Lingus Shares pursuant to the IPO. The 
ESOT also agreed to this price. The Ryanair Offer of EUR2.80 is a generous premium of 27 per cent. in just 
8 days.
 --      Ryanair stakebuilding has supported share price appreciation since IPO
 The price appreciation of Aer Lingus Shares post the IPO but prior to Ryanair's Cash Offer on 5 October 
2006 occurred over the same short period during which Ryanair was purchasing a 16 per cent. stake in Aer 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc
Lingus at an average price of EUR2.42. On 2 October and 3 October, days during which Ryanair was not 
actively purchasing Aer Lingus Shares, the average price per Aer Lingus Share fell back from EUR2.48 to 
EUR2.41.
 --      Volatile earnings record of Aer Lingus
 Aer Lingus is an airline with a volatile earnings record which came close to bankruptcy four years ago, 
and whose cumulative losses (EUR616m) exceeded its cumulative profits (EUR433m) over the past 14 years by 
over EUR180m. By contrast, Ryanair has been profitable in every one of the past 14 years.
 --      Irish Government receives over EUR500 million and achieves its strategic objectives
 If it accepts the Cash Offer the Irish Government will realise over EUR500 million from the sale of its 
Aer Lingus Shares whilst also achieving its stated objectives of retaining the Heathrow slots and the Aer 
Lingus brand, and securing the long term future of the airline.
 --      Aer Lingus employees realise an average of over EUR60,000 each - tax free structure for ESOT 
Members
 If they accept our Cash Offer, Aer Lingus employees will realise over EUR220m from the sale of their Aer 
Lingus Shares. This represents an average of over EUR60,000 for each employee. There is also a means by 
which Aer Lingus employees and former employees, who are ESOT Members, can realise the proceeds of the 
sale of the shares held by the ESOT in a tax free manner (see  the Appendix to this announcement). Ryanair 
believes that the consequences of its bid failing will be that Aer Lingus employees will hold a 
substantial minority shareholding, the value of which will have fallen significantly, in an illiquid 
company, and Ryanair would urge ESOT Members to bear this in mind in their consideration of the Offer and 
their communications with the ESOT trustees.
 Good for competition and good for consumers
 Ryanair's Offer commits to maintaining Aer Lingus as a stand-alone separate airline. Because the two 
airlines will compete vigorously, this will not lead to a monopoly. In any event, the question of a 
monopoly does not arise as there are 50 other scheduled airlines competing with Ryanair and/or Aer Lingus 
at Dublin Airport, some of which (Air France, Lufthansa and British Airways) are significantly larger than 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus combined.
 There is little crossover because Ryanair and Aer Lingus only compete on about 17 of more than 500 
combined routes.
 Whilst Ryanair and Aer Lingus have 61% of movements at Dublin Airport, this is not dissimilar to other 
large airline groupings at other European airports including SAS and its Lufthansa partners in Copenhagen 
(over 85% of seats), Austrian and its Lufthansa partners in Vienna (over 70% of movements), Olympic in 
Athens (over 73% of seats), TAP and its Star Alliance Partners in Lisbon (60% of seats), Air France and 
its Sky Team Associates in Charles de Gaulle (62% of movements), and Lufthansa and its Star Alliance 
Partners in Munich (67% of movements).
 During the 6 months to 30 June 2006, Aer Lingus' average short haul fare increased by 2% to EUR86.49. 
This is in line with Aer Lingus' strategy to "Maximise Passenger Revenues" (Source: IPO Prospectus, p71). 
Similarly, Aer Lingus has refused to reduce its fuel surcharge despite recent falls in oil prices. Rising 
fares and high fuel surcharges are bad for competition and bad for consumers.
 By contrast, Ryanair's Offer guarantees to reduce Aer Lingus' short haul fares by 21/2% per year for a 
minimum period of 4 years and to reduce Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as oil prices fall. Lower fares and 
lower surcharges will be good for consumers. Ryanair's Offer will therefore increase competition and lower 
prices which is good for consumers.
 Good for the future of Aer Lingus
 The board of Ryanair believes that this Offer represents a unique opportunity to form one strong Irish 
airline group with over 50 million passengers per annum, capable of competing against the three European 
mega-carriers (Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa). Without Ryanair, Aer Lingus will continue to be 
a small regional European airline which, because of its size and regional nature, is unlikely to be of 
interest or relevance to the three major European airline groupings.
 Ryanair provides Aer Lingus with a strong airline partner of substantial financial strength and access to 
low cost aircraft and financing. Ryanair's strategy will be to expand, enhance and upgrade Aer Lingus' 
operations. Ryanair intends to retain the Aer Lingus brand and operate the two airlines separately. Both 
companies will continue to compete vigorously in the small number of routes (about 17) where they 
currently compete, and will focus on reducing costs and lowering air fares.
 If successful, the Offer will replicate similar airline consolidations in other European countries by the 
likes of British Airways (which acquired British Caledonian, Danair, and Cityflyer and invested in 
Iberia); Air France (which acquired KLM, Britair and Regional) and Lufthansa (which acquired Eurowings, 
Swiss, and Lufthansa Cityline and invested in SAS and BMI). This pan-European trend towards airline 
consolidation has seen the emergence of three "mega carriers", Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa. 
A privatized Aer Lingus (without a strategic partner) will be unable to compete with these mega carriers 
because it has neither the scale nor the route network. Equally Aer Lingus will be unable to compete with 
low cost carriers such as Ryanair because it has neither the cost base nor the low fare structure.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc
 Isolated as a small regional airline, Aer Lingus will continue to be at the mercy of its controlling 
shareholders (the Irish Government and the workers/trade unions) whose de facto control over the airline 
in recent years has seen it:
 --      Lurch from crisis to crisis.
 --      Incur substantial cumulative losses.
 --      Suffer repeated strikes, work stoppages and industrial action.
 --      Discourage successful management.
 --      Preside over 3,000 job losses.
 --      Significantly reduce services on routes between Ireland and the UK.
 Brighter future with Ryanair
 Ryanair offers a better, viable, financially secure future for Aer Lingus through its strategy which 
includes:
 --      Reducing Aer Lingus' average short haul fare (EUR87.55 in 2005) by 10% over the next four years. 
These fare reductions will promote competition, will benefit consumers and will reverse Aer Lingus' 
current strategy which is to "maximise passenger revenues". (Source: IPO Prospectus.)
 --      Reducing Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as oil prices fall (something that Aer Lingus recently 
refused to do).
 --      Retaining the Aer Lingus brand and continuing to operate the two airlines separately.
 --      Retaining all profitable routes currently operated by Aer Lingus.
 --      Reducing Aer Lingus' costs through improved efficiencies, superior purchasing power and lowering 
overheads.
 --      Assisting Aer Lingus with its fleet expansion either by providing it with access to Ryanair's 
lower cost aircraft, or using Ryanair's purchasing power to negotiate lower costs with aircraft 
manufacturers.
 --      Upgrading Aer Lingus' transatlantic fleet and updating its long haul product.
 --      Improving Aer Lingus' inferior customer service by reducing delays, cancellations and lost 
baggage.
 Statements of Aer Lingus Board and the Minister for Transport
 Aer Lingus board announcement 5th October 2006
 In its announcement which appeared on the RNS on 5 October last, the Aer Lingus board claimed:
 "This approach is unsolicited, wholly opportunistic and significantly undervalues the Group's businesses 
and attractive long term growth potential."

 Ryanair wishes to clarify statements taken out of context by some media reports following a new route 
press conference this morning in Dublin, as to whether Ryanair would increase its Offer.
 Ryanair's Offer is an excellent Offer and the Board has not considered any increase in the Offer for Aer 
Lingus and therefore any increase cannot be ruled in or ruled out.

 We conducted our review in accordance with guidance contained in Bulletin 1999/4 "Review of Interim 
Financial Information" issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in Ireland and the United Kingdom.   
A review consists principally of making enquiries of group management and applying analytical procedures 
to the financial information and underlying financial data and, based thereon, assessing whether the 
accounting policies and presentation have been consistently applied unless otherwise disclosed.  A review 
excludes audit procedures such as tests of controls and verification of assets, liabilities and 
transactions.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit performed in accordance with Auditing 
Standards and therefore provides a lower level of assurance than an audit.  Accordingly we do not express 
an audit opinion on the financial information.
 Emphasis of matter
 Without qualifying our review conclusion, we draw attention to note 3 to the document published by 
Ryanair on 2nd August 2005, entitled "Explanation of the Financial Impact Following the Adoption of 
International Financial Reporting Standards", that explains why there is a possibility that the company's 
management may determine that changes to the accounting policies adopted in preparing the consolidated 
interim financial information are necessary when management prepares its first annual financial statements 
in accordance with accounting standards adopted by the EU as of 31 March 2006.
 Review conclusion
 On the basis of our review we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the 
financial information as presented for the six months ended 30 September 2005, which is stated to have 
been prepared in accordance with the basis of preparation note set out in note 3 to the "Explanation of 
the Financial Impact Following the Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards".  This 
describes how the recognition and measurement requirements of accounting standards expected to be adopted 
by the EU for use at the next annual reporting date have been applied, including the assumptions 
management has made about the standards and interpretations expected to be effective, and the policies 
expected to be adopted, when management prepares its first annual financial statements in accordance with 
accounting standards adopted by the EU as of 31 March 2006.

 OFFER UPDATE
 LAPSE OF OFFER
 Ryanair Holdings plc announces that following today's decision of the European Commission to refer the 
acquisition of Aer Lingus to Phase II, Ryanair's Offer lapses, in accordance with the requirements of the Takeover 
Rules, with immediate effect and all acceptances of the Offer received to date are void.
 Ryanair also announces that in the event of European Commission clearance following its Phase II review, Ryanair 
intends to make a further offer for Aer Lingus ("Further Offer"). The making of any such Further Offer would require 
consent of the Panel to a derogation from the prohibition on making a further offer within twelve months after the 
date on which the original Offer lapsed. The Takeover Rules Notes specifically provide that the Panel may grant its 
consent in circumstances where a previous offer has lapsed as a result of a Phase II enquiry by the European 
Commission and following approval by the Commission a new offer is made within 21 days of such decision.
 Ryanair will make further announcements when appropriate.

 Cash Offer
 by
 Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley
 on behalf of
 Ryanair Holdings plc
 for
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 Summary
 The board of Ryanair advises that it has acquired through a wholly owned subsidiary, Coinside Limited, 
84,775,000 Aer Lingus Shares representing approximately 16 per cent. of the Issued Share Capital of Aer 
Lingus. The board of Ryanair now announces its intention to make a Cash Offer of EUR2.80 per Aer Lingus 
Share for the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus not already in the beneficial ownership 
or control of the Ryanair Group.  This Cash Offer is conditional on, amongst other things, obtaining at 
least a majority of the Aer Lingus Shares.
 The board of Ryanair believes the Cash Offer represents an excellent price for Aer Lingus Shares given 
that only 8 days ago the Government of Ireland, Aer Lingus and their respective advisers determined that 
EUR2.20 was an appropriate price at which to issue and sell Aer Lingus Shares pursuant to the IPO.
 The Cash Offer values each Aer Lingus Share at EUR2.80 and values the entire issued and to be issued 
ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus at approximately EUR1.481bn. It represents:
 --    a premium of approximately 27 per cent. over the IPO Price of an Aer Lingus Share of EUR2.20 per 
share; and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -2-
 --    a premium of approximately 12 per cent. over the Closing Price of an Aer Lingus Share on 4 October 
2006, the last day prior to this announcement, of EUR2.51.
 In addition, the board of Ryanair notes that the Aer Lingus Share price appreciation since the IPO 
occurred during the same short period in which Ryanair acquired approximately 16 per cent. of Aer Lingus 
Shares at an average price of EUR2.42 per Aer Lingus Share which further emphasises the attractiveness of 
the Cash Offer.  On 2 October and 3 October, days during which Ryanair was not actively buying Aer Lingus 
Shares, the price per Aer Lingus Share fell back from EUR2.48 to EUR2.41.
 The Cash Offer, which will be made by Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley on behalf of Ryanair (or 
a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair), will be subject to certain conditions set out in Appendix I, 
including amongst other conditions, the acceptance by Aer Lingus Shareholders holding not less than 90 per 
cent. of the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus (or such lower percentage as Ryanair may 
determine, subject always to the Takeover Rules) and the passing of the Ryanair Shareholder Resolutions at 
an EGM to be held as soon as practicable to approve the Cash Offer. In the event that the Offer is 
declared unconditional in all respects, Aer Lingus Shareholders who have not accepted the Offer may 
experience a reduction in the liquidity of their Aer Lingus Shares.
 Commenting on the Offer, Mr Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive of Ryanair said:
 "This Offer represents a unique opportunity to form one strong airline group for Ireland and for European 
consumers.  We will expand, enhance and upgrade the Aer Lingus operations. This offer - if successful - 
means both companies will continue to operate separately and compete vigorously on the small number of 
routes on which we both operate - currently around 17 of the 500 or so routes operated by the two 
airlines.   We believe the price of EUR2.80 to be an excellent offer. If accepted the Irish Government 
will realise over EUR500m from the sale of their Aer Lingus shares, and the employees will realise over 
EUR220m which equates to an average of over EUR60,000 per employee."
 The combined strength of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would establish an Irish airline group with over 50m 
passengers annually, capable of competing on the European and World stage against other large European 
airline groups, including Lufthansa/SAS/Swiss (75m passengers), Air France/KLM (70m passengers) and 
BA/Iberia (63m passengers). As the European airline industry consolidates, this acquisition, if it 
proceeds, will replicate previous consolidations in France (Air France/Brit Air/Regionale/KLM), UK 
(BA/B.Cal/DanAir/City Express), Germany (Lufthansa/Eurowings/Lufthansa Cityline/Swiss) and Scandinavia 
(SAS/Braethens).
 The board of Ryanair believes there are benefits of combining these two Irish and European airlines into 
one group, and to give a flavour of what this offer - if successful - might mean to Aer Lingus, its 
stakeholders and the people of Ireland and Europe, Ryanair intends to:-
 --    Reduce Aer Lingus' average short haul fare (EUR87.55 in 2005 (source : IPO Prospectus)) by 2 [1/2]% 
a year for a minimum period of four years;
 --    Reduce Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as the price of oil falls from recent highs;
 --    Retain the Aer Lingus brand;
 --    Retain the Heathrow slots;
 --    Retain all profitable routes currently operated by Aer Lingus;
 --    Reduce Aer Lingus' costs through improved efficiencies and Ryanair's superior purchasing power;
 --    Give Aer Lingus access to the benefit of Ryanair's lower cost aircraft deliveries and lower cost 
financing facilities;
 --    Upgrade Aer Lingus' transatlantic fleet and improve its long haul product;
 --    Maintain Aer Lingus as a stand alone, separate company within one strong Irish airline group under 
common ownership but run as separate competing airlines.
 As the above benefits demonstrate, the board of Ryanair intends to deliver a publicly owned, Irish 
managed and headquartered airline group with the necessary ambition, expertise, financial strength and 
cost base to take on European and Global competitors well into the future.  As an island nation, Ireland 
is critically dependent upon strong and secure low fare airline services in order to sustain and develop 
tourism and economic growth. Investing in Aer Lingus is attractive for Ryanair and its shareholders 
because, amongst other things, Aer Lingus' earnings yield is superior to the returns currently available 
on Ryanair's cash deposits. The board of Ryanair believes that there will be opportunities (by combining 
the purchasing power of Ryanair and Aer Lingus) to reduce operating costs, to increase efficiencies and to 
pass on these savings in the form of low fares to the travelling public.
 Ryanair has grown to be Europe's largest low fares airline by continuously lowering prices and funding 
these reductions through cost savings and efficiencies.  The board of Ryanair believes there is an 
opportunity to apply this successful low fares formula to Aer Lingus where currently, in its short haul 
operation, fares and costs remain far too high.  Ryanair would also expect to work closely with Aer 
Lingus, if the offer is successful, to improve its long haul operations where the board of Ryanair 
believes there is room to upgrade the long haul fleet and improve this product which has not kept pace 
with the competition in recent years.  Since the board of Ryanair envisages that the two companies would 
be run separately, in the event that the Offer is successful, nothing in this transaction will deflect 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -2-
Ryanair from continuing to focus on its own pan-European expansion or from continuing to deliver unit cost 
reductions and continuing to offer lower fares to millions of Ryanair's European passengers.
 There are numerous precedents across Europe (in the UK, France, Spain, Germany and Scandinavia) for two 
airlines of similar nationality coming together to form a stronger, more widely diversified airline group. 
The European Union has recognised the value of competitive European airline consolidation because of the 
benefits which it brings to consumers.  Ryanair believes this Offer, if successful, will result in that 
precedent being replicated here in Ireland and elsewhere, with the added benefit that customers of Aer 
Lingus will enjoy lower fares in the short haul market, a better product and service in the long haul 
market by reducing fuel surcharges as oil prices fall, as Ryanair applies its philosophy of lower costs 
and lower fares to Aer Lingus' existing business.
 This summary should be read in conjunction with the full text of the following announcement.

Body
 Aer Lingus' high fares render it unable to compete with Ryanair and other airlines including Easyjet, and 
this casts considerable doubt on its profitability and revenue maximisation strategy. Over recent years 
Aer Lingus has been forced either to withdraw or reduce services across most of the key Ireland to UK 
routes including Gatwick, London City, Stansted, Liverpool, Bristol, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
 2.     Aer Lingus' cost per passenger is too high
 Aer Lingus' estimated average cost per short-haul passenger at EUR80, is double that of Ryanair. Given 
Aer Lingus' dependence on the Irish market, its rising cost base, and its inability to compete with 
Ryanair and other carriers, it is inevitable that Aer Lingus will struggle to compete with Ryanair's lower 
fares on both its UK and European routes.
 3.     Customer service delivery requires improvement
 Aer Lingus' customer service delivery continues to underperform compared to Ryanair. We believe that Aer 
Lingus' "on time" performance, rate of flight cancellations and lost baggage record have historically 
lagged behind those of Ryanair. The CAA's punctuality statistics for 2005 show that just 72% of Aer 
Lingus' UK flights operated on time, way behind Ryanair's 81% record. Because of Ryanair's superior 
customer service delivery and lower prices, Ryanair believes that on most routes where passengers have a 
choice, many more of them prefer to fly with Ryanair.
 4.     Aer Lingus revenue maximisation strategy is unlikely to be achieved
 Ryanair has recently announced further new route expansion from Dublin to Continental Europe. In Summer 
2007, Ryanair will offer 53 European routes from Dublin compared to just 33 in Summer 2006. Whether this 
Offer succeeds or otherwise, the amount and extent of competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus will 
intensify further next year. Ryanair's lower fares, younger fleet, lower cost base and better frequencies 
will put downward pressure on Aer Lingus' short haul fares and its profitability at a time when its stated 
strategy is "Maximising Passenger Revenues" (i.e. not passing on savings to passengers but charging them 
as much as Aer Lingus will get away with).
 5.     Aer Lingus' high fuel surcharges inhibit long haul growth
 Aer Lingus' refusal to reduce its fuel surcharges as oil prices fall will inhibit the growth of its long 
haul business. Aer Lingus confirmed in the Irish media on 4 October that it "had no plans to abolish or 
reduce their fuel surcharges despite falling oil prices" (Source: Irish Independent).
 The Consumer Association of Ireland called on Aer Lingus to abolish or reduce its fuel surcharges given 
that oil prices had fallen by up to 25% in recent weeks. The continuation of these high surcharges at a 
time when oil prices have fallen is bad for consumers and competition.
 6.         Aer Lingus is exposed to high and rising costs at Dublin Airport
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -3-
 As the IPO Prospectus confirms, Aer Lingus - unlike Ryanair - is heavily dependent on Dublin Airport 
(i.e. the DAA). This exposes Aer Lingus to high and rising costs at Dublin due to Aer Lingus' lack of 
purchasing power. The DAA monopoly recently proposed a second terminal at a cost of over EUR750m - 41/2 
times more than the original EUR170m cost announced in August 2005. This fourfold increase in the cost of 
this facility (which is designed primarily for Aer Lingus) has led the Chairman of the DAA to announce 
recently that it would be seeking a 60% increase in charges at Dublin Airport. Any such cost increase will 
have a detrimental impact on Aer Lingus' costs (and hence passenger fares) because of its over-reliance on 
Dublin. Furthermore, as a small regional airline, Aer Lingus has little purchasing power and will continue 
to be at the mercy of substantial cost increases at many airports and other providers of services and 
products.
 7.         Aer Lingus is a small, regional, peripheral European carrier
 With 8 million passengers annually compared to Ryanair's estimated 42.5 million this year, Aer Lingus is 
smaller than many other similar European mid-size carriers who have in recent years either been taken over 
or have sold significant minority stakes to one of the European mega carriers. Aer Lingus is smaller in 
traffic terms than other such European regional airlines including Swiss, BMI, SAS (all Lufthansa 
subsidiaries/associates), KLM (Air France), Iberia (BA), Alitalia and Air Berlin. Because of its 
peripheral location and modest size, Aer Lingus is unlikely to be an attractive partner to any of the 
European mega carriers (Air France, BA, Lufthansa) as is evidenced by Aer Lingus' recent decision to 
terminate its membership of BA's One World alliance.
 Without a strong financial/airline partner, Aer Lingus will be exposed to the volatility of the 
international markets and the cyclical nature of the air travel industry. As an indication of how Ryanair 
could transform Aer Lingus' purchasing power, Ryanair has in the last month purchased more new short haul 
aircraft (32) than are in Aer Lingus' entire short haul fleet (28).
 8.         Aer Lingus' isolation will limit growth
 Without Ryanair's investment, Aer Lingus will be excluded from the EU-wide trend towards airline 
consolidation. This consolidation will have damaging consequences for Aer Lingus' existing business.
 SUSTAINABILITY OF CURRENT SHARE PRICE IS UNCERTAIN WITHOUT RYANAIR
 9.         Share price inflated by Ryanair offer
 Aer Lingus' post IPO share price increased largely on the back of Ryanair's stake building. During the 
two days (Mon 2nd and Tues 3rd October) during which Ryanair was not actively buying shares, the price of 
Aer Lingus shares fell back from EUR2.48 to EUR2.44, and then from EUR2.44 to EUR2.41. Aer Lingus' share 
price is likely to fall significantly if the Ryanair bid fails.
 10.      Free float will be limited
 Ryanair is committed to maintaining a significant minority stake in Aer Lingus. The Government has 
confirmed that it "remains committed to maintaining a share of least 25.1%" (Source: Statement of Minister 
for Transport, 6 October 2006). The ESOT and employees could hold up to a further 15%. If the Ryanair bid 
fails, this shareholder profile will significantly reduce Aer Lingus' free float, which will make for an 
illiquid market in Aer Lingus' shares.
 11.      Adverse consequences for ESOT shareholding
 Ryanair believes that the consequences of its bid failing will be that the ESOT will hold a substantial 
minority shareholding, the value of which will have fallen significantly, in an illiquid company, and 
Ryanair would urge ESOT Members to bear this in mind in their consideration of the Offer and their 
communications with the ESOT trustees. By contrast, if the ESOT accepts this Offer, it will realise a 
substantial premium over the IPO price, its members will be working for a much more secure Irish airline 
group, it will own highly liquid shares in Ryanair with an option to dispose of them over the coming years 
in a tax free structure (as set out in the Appendix to this announcement), and Aer Lingus employees can 
realise an average of over EUR60,000 tax free per person.
 CONTINUATION OF GOVERNMENT / TRADE UNION CONTROL COULD IMPAIR SHAREHOLDERS' INVESTMENT
 12.      Government and Trade Union domination will not be in all shareholders' interest
 If the bid fails, Ryanair will be a significant minority shareholder, without board representation and 
with no influence over the day to day management and operations of Aer Lingus. The airline will continue 
to be dominated by the Irish Government and the ESOT/employees/trade unions who between them currently 
control over 40% of the airline's shares and have appointed all of the current board of directors. In 
these circumstances the dominant influence in Aer Lingus will continue to be the interests of employees 
rather than the interests of all shareholders.
 The directors of Aer Lingus may find it very difficult to discharge their fiduciary duty to act in the 
best interests of the company as a whole, and the Aer Lingus board may well face the prospect of 
stalemate, ineffectiveness and conflict.
 "Employee interest" domination has impaired the performance of Aer Lingus in recent years. Examples 
include:
 -      A history of strikes, stoppages and inefficient work practices.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -3-
 -      An inconsistent and volatile earnings record. Aer Lingus' cumulative losses (EUR616m) 
significantly exceeded its cumulative profits (EUR433m) over the last 14 years. This has forced the 
airline into two substantial re-organisations, yet despite this its costs per passenger are double that of 
Ryanair.
 -      Aer Lingus courted bankruptcy on two occasions in recent years and only survived following a 
massive injection of over EUR220m of State aid and two radical restructuring plans.
 -      Effective management is discouraged. The previous management team (led by Willie Walsh) departed 
in January 2005 having been roundly criticised and undermined by both the trade unions and the Irish 
government. The Prime Minister in the Irish Parliament attacked the management's then proposed MBO as "[a 
time] when management wanted to steal the assets for themselves through a management buyout, shafting 
staff interests". Investors will be exposed to the continuing practice of the Irish government, trade 
unions and employees to run Aer Lingus in the interests of staff rather than the interests of all 
shareholders.
 -      The record of European airlines which continue to be dominated by governments and trade unions is 
an abysmal one. It is characterised by bankruptcy (in the case of Sabena and Swissair) or chronic and 
repeated crises (in the case of Alitalia and Olympic Airways).

 RYANAIR TO APPEAL ITALIAN COURT'S DECSION
 TO BLOCK LOW FARES AND COMPETITON
 Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Friday, 12(th) May 2006) stated that it will appeal the 
decision of the regional administrative court of Lazio to stop Ryanair and Easyjet's low fare  flights on 
routes between mainland Italy and Sardinia.
 The Italian authorities blocked Ryanair's low fare flights between Rome and Alghero by imposing a Public 
Service Obligation on the route in spite of the fact that 2 airlines (Ryanair and Airone) were already 
operating year round flights between Rome and Alghero.  This is not allowed under European PSO rules. 
These rules have also been abused by the Italian authorities because Alitalia is being allowed to fly on 
PSO routes to Sardinia when it did not even apply to operate them in the first place.
 Speaking today Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
 "We have instructed our lawyers to appeal this decision to the European courts to ensure that low fares 
and competition are allowed in Italy. It is astonishing that while Ryanair has been blocked from offering 
low fares between mainland Italy and Sardinia, Alitalia is being allowed to sell its high fares on PSO 
routes that it did not even apply for.
 "The PSO system in Europe is clearly out of control. It is being abused by national Governments to 
protect high fare flag carriers while at the same time blocking low fare competition.  Italian consumers 
and visitors should not be forced to pay higher fares because the Italian authorities are abusing the PSO 
system to protect Alitalia and other high fare Italian airlines".
 Ends.                                                               Friday, 12(th) May 2006

 Cash Offer
 by
 Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley
 on behalf of
 Ryanair Holdings plc
 for
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 1.      Introduction
 The board of Ryanair announces that it has acquired through a wholly owned subsidiary, Coinside Limited, 
84,775,000 Aer Lingus Shares representing approximately 16 per cent. of the Issued Share Capital of Aer 
Lingus. The board of Ryanair now announces the terms of a Cash Offer for Aer Lingus to be made by Davy 
Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley on behalf of Ryanair, for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary 
share capital of Aer Lingus not already in the beneficial ownership or control of Ryanair.  The making of 
the Cash Offer is subject to certain conditions set out in Appendix I, including, amongst other 
conditions, the acceptance by Aer Lingus Shareholders holding not less than 90 per cent. of the issued and 
to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus (or such lower percentage as Ryanair may determine subject always 
to the Takeover Rules) not already in the beneficial ownership or control of Ryanair and the passing of 
the Ryanair Shareholder Resolutions at an EGM to be held as soon as practicable to approve the Offer.
 2.      The Cash Offer
 On behalf of Ryanair, Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley will offer to acquire all of the issued 
and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus not already in the beneficial ownership or control of 
Ryanair, subject to the conditions and on the terms set out in Appendix I to this announcement and to be 
set out in the Offer Document and the related Forms of Acceptance, on the following basis:
 EUR2.80 in cash for every Aer Lingus Share
 The board of Ryanair believes the Cash Offer represents an excellent price for Aer Lingus Shares given 
that only 8 days ago the Government of Ireland, Aer Lingus and their respective advisers determined that 
EUR2.20 was an appropriate price at which to issue and sell Aer Lingus Shares pursuant to the IPO.
 The Cash Offer values each Aer Lingus Share at EUR2.80 and values the Issued Share Capital of Aer Lingus 
at approximately EUR1.481bn.  It represents:
 --    a premium of approximately 27 per cent. over the IPO Price of an Aer Lingus Share of EUR2.20 per 
share; and
 --    a premium of approximately 12 per cent. over the Closing Price of an Aer Lingus Share on 4 October 
2006, the last day prior to the date of this announcement, of EUR2.51.
 In addition, the board of Ryanair notes that the Aer Lingus Share price appreciation since the IPO 
occurred during the same short period in which Ryanair acquired approximately 16 per cent. of Aer Lingus 
Shares at an average price of EUR2.42 per Aer Lingus Share, which further emphasises the attractiveness of 
the Cash Offer. On 2 October and 3 October, days during which Ryanair was not actively buying Aer Lingus 
Shares, the price per Aer Lingus Share fell back from EUR2.48 to EUR2.41.
 The Offer will extend to all Aer Lingus Shares (other than those Aer Lingus Shares already beneficially 
owned by Ryanair as at the date of the Offer) unconditionally allotted or issued on the date of the Offer 
(including Aer Lingus Shares issued pursuant to the Over Allotment Arrangements), together with any 
further such shares which are unconditionally allotted or issued (including Aer Lingus Shares issued 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -3-
pursuant to the Over Allotment Arrangements) while the Offer remains open for acceptance or until such 
earlier date as, subject to the Takeover Rules, Ryanair may determine.
 The Aer Lingus Shares are to be acquired fully paid and free from all liens, charges and encumbrances, 
rights of pre-emption and any other third party rights or interests of any nature whatsoever and together 
with all rights attaching thereto including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions (if 
any) declared, made or paid thereafter.
 The Offer shall be made by Ryanair or a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair.

 If Ryanair receives acceptances of the Cash Offer in respect of, and/or otherwise acquires, 90 per cent. 
or more of the Aer Lingus Shares to which the Cash Offer relates (and in the case where the Aer Lingus 
Shares to which the Cash Offer relates are voting shares, not less than 90 per cent. of the voting rights 
carried by those Aer Lingus Shares) and assuming all other conditions of the Cash Offer have been 
satisfied or waived (if they are capable of being waived), Ryanair intends to exercise its rights pursuant 
to the provisions of Regulation 23 of the Takeover Regulations to acquire the remaining Aer Lingus Shares 
to which the Cash Offer relates on the same terms as the Cash Offer.
 As soon as it is appropriate and possible to do so and subject to the Offer becoming or being declared 
unconditional in all respects, and subject to any applicable requirements of the Irish Stock Exchange, the 
London Stock Exchange or the UK Listing Authority, Ryanair intends to apply for the cancellation of the 
listing of the Aer Lingus Shares on the Irish Stock Exchange and the UK Official List and for the 
cancellation of admission to trading of Aer Lingus Shares on the markets of the Irish Stock Exchange and 
the London Stock Exchange and to propose a resolution to re-register Aer Lingus as a private company under 
the relevant provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983. If this de-listing and cancellation 
occurs, it will significantly reduce the liquidity and marketability of any Aer Lingus Shares not assented 
to the Cash Offer. It is anticipated that the cancellations will take effect no earlier than 20 Business 
Days from either the date Ryanair has acquired 75% of the voting rights in Aer Lingus or on the first date 
of issue of compulsory acquisition notices by Ryanair pursuant to Regulation 23 of the Takeover 
Regulations.

 RYANAIR ADVISES THAT IT HAS ACQUIRED A 16% STAKE IN AER LINGUS AND ANNOUNCES AN ALL-CASH OFFER OF EUR2.80 
PER SHARE VALUING AER LINGUS AT EUR1.481BN
 The board of Ryanair Holdings plc today (5(th) October 2006) advises that it has acquired over 16% of the 
issued share capital of Aer Lingus Group plc.  Ryanair now announces its intention to make an all cash 
offer of EUR2.80 per share for the issued share capital of Aer Lingus not already in the ownership of 
Ryanair.  This offer is conditional on, among other things, obtaining at least a majority of the shares in 
Aer Lingus.  This cash offer values Aer Lingus at approximately EUR1.481bn and represents a premium of 27% 
(approximately) over last week's IPO share price of EUR2.20 per share and a premium of 12% (approximately) 
over last evening's closing price for Aer Lingus shares of EUR2.51.
 The share price appreciation since the Aer Lingus IPO occurred during the same short period in which 
Ryanair acquired over 16% of Aer Lingus shares at an average price of EUR2.42 per share.  During the 2(nd) 
and 3(rd) of October - the two days during which Ryanair was not actively buying Aer Lingus shares - the 
share price fell back from EUR2.48 to EUR2.41.
 Speaking at the launch of the offer this morning, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "This offer represents a unique opportunity to form one strong airline group for Ireland and for European 
consumers. We will expand, enhance and upgrade the Aer Lingus operations. This offer - if successful - 
means both companies will continue to operate separately and compete vigorously in the small number of 
routes on which we both operate - currently around 17 of the approximately 500 routes operated by the two 
airlines.   We believe the price of EUR2.80 to be an excellent offer. If accepted the Irish Government 
will realise over EUR500m from the sale of their Aer Lingus shares, and the employees will realise over 
EUR220m which equates to an average of over EUR60,000 per employee."
 The combined strength of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would establish an Irish airline group with over 50m 
passengers annually, capable of competing on the European and World stage against other large European 
airline groups, including Lufthansa/SAS/Swiss (75m passengers), Air France/KLM (70m passengers) and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus
BA/Iberia (63m passengers). As the European airline industry consolidates, this acquisition, if it 
proceeds, will largely replicate previous consolidations in, for example, France (Air France/Brit 
Air/Regionale/KLM), 
UK 
(BA/B.Cal/DanAir/City 
Express), 
Germany 
(Lufthansa/Eurowings/Lufthansa 
Cityline/Swiss) and Scandinavia (SAS/Braethens).
 There are benefits of combining these two Irish and European airlines into one group.  To give a flavour 
of what this offer - if successful - might mean to Aer Lingus, its stakeholders and the people of Ireland 
and Europe, Ryanair intends to:-
 -    Reduce Aer Lingus' average short haul fare (EUR87.55 in 2005) by 2 [1/2]% a year for a minimum 
period of four years;
 -    Reduce Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as the price of oil falls from recent highs;
 -    Retain the Aer Lingus brand;
 -    Retain the Heathrow slots;
 -    Retain all profitable routes currently operated by Aer Lingus;
 -    Reduce Aer Lingus' costs through improved efficiencies and Ryanair's superior purchasing power;
 -    Give Aer Lingus access to the benefit of Ryanair's lower cost aircraft deliveries and lower cost 
financing facilities;
 -    Upgrade Aer Lingus' transatlantic fleet and improve its long haul product;
 -    Maintain Aer Lingus as a stand alone, separate company within one strong Irish airline group under 
common ownership but run as separate competing airlines.
 As the above benefits demonstrate, the Board of Ryanair intends to deliver a publicly owned, Irish 
managed and headquartered airline group with the necessary ambition, expertise, financial strength and 
cost base to take on European and Global competitors well into the future.  As an island nation, Ireland 
is critically dependant upon strong and secure low fare airline services in order to sustain and develop 
tourism and economic growth. Investing in Aer Lingus is attractive for Ryanair and its shareholders 
because, amongst other things, Aer Lingus' earnings yield is superior to the returns currently available 
on Ryanair's cash deposits. Ryanair believes that there will be opportunities (by combining the purchasing 
power of Ryanair and Aer Lingus) to reduce operating costs, to increase efficiencies and to pass on these 
savings in the form of low fares to the travelling public.
 Ryanair has grown to be Europe's largest low fares airline by continuously lowering prices and funding 
these reductions through cost savings and efficiencies.  We believe there is an opportunity to apply this 
successful low fares formula to Aer Lingus where currently, in its short haul operation, fares and costs 
remain far too high.  We would also expect to work closely with Aer Lingus, if the offer is successful, to 
improve its long haul operations where we believe there is room to upgrade the long haul fleet and improve 
this product which has not kept pace with the competition in recent years.  Since we envisage that the two 
companies would be run separately, in the event that this offer is successful, nothing in this transaction 
will deflect Ryanair from continuing to focus on its own pan-European expansion or from continuing to 
deliver unit cost reductions and continuing to offer lower fares to millions of Ryanair's European 
passengers.
 There are numerous precedents across Europe (for example, in the UK, France, Spain, Germany and 
Scandinavia) for two airlines of similar nationality coming together to form a stronger, more widely 
diversified airline group. The European Union has recognised the value of competitive European airline 
consolidation because of the benefits which it brings to consumers.  This offer, if successful, will 
result in that precedent being largely replicated here in Ireland and elsewhere, with the added benefit 
that customers of Aer Lingus will enjoy lower fares in the short haul market, a better product and service 
in the long haul market by reducing fuel surcharges as oil prices fall, as Ryanair applies its philosophy 
of lower costs and lower fares to Aer Lingus' existing business.
 In accordance with the strict rules which apply to takeovers, Ryanair is limited in its ability to answer 
questions in relation to this offer.
 This release should be read in conjunction with the full text of the rule 2.5 announcement issued today.
 The directors of Ryanair accept responsibility for the information contained in this announcement other

WINCANTON plc
 PRE-CLOSE SEASON UPDATE
 Wincanton plc today issues the following pre-close season update for the six months ending 30 September 2003:
 "We are beginning to see the benefits of the broader service offering and geographic presence of the enlarged 
Wincanton.  New business activity continues to be encouraging in respect of both national and cross-border 
opportunities.
 Our UK businesses, although held back by reduced activity levels in our chilled consolidation network, are 
performing well and benefiting from our enhanced market position.  In Continental Europe, good performances in 
our 4PL operations and in countries such as Poland and Hungary are being offset to some extent by lower volumes 
in Spain and parts of our French business.  In Germany, the performance of our logistics and transport network 
operations continues to improve but our intermodal business has been adversely affected by very low Rhine water 
levels.
 We nonetheless anticipate full year performance, which will be more weighted towards the second half, to be 
broadly in line with our expectations.  Cashflow is also expected to benefit from asset disposals, particularly in 
respect of our property portfolio."

 If the Offer lapses, it will cease to be capable of further acceptance. Aer Lingus Shareholders who have 
already accepted the Offer shall then cease to be bound by the acceptances delivered on or before the date 
on which the Offer lapses.

 Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter Ended September 30, 2005
 Profit after tax, increased by 16% to EUR172.5m due to a 3% increase in average fares and strong 
ancillary revenue growth, which was offset by fuel costs which increased by 105% to EUR127.0m reflecting 
the higher US$ cost per gallon.  Operating margins, as a result, fell by 5 points to 37%, which in turn 
resulted in operating profit increasing by 18% to EUR202.2m compared to the previous quarter.
 Total operating revenues increased by 32% to EUR541.5m whilst passenger volumes increased by 28% to 9.5m.  
Total revenue per passenger increased by 3% in the quarter due to a combination of higher average fares, 
strong ancillary revenue growth but was partially offset by the weakening of Sterling exchange rate 
against the Euro.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 31% to EUR470.5m due to a combination of increased passenger 
volumes on existing routes, the successful launch of new bases at Luton, Liverpool and Shannon and a 3% 
increase in average fares, partially offset by the weakening of Sterling exchange rate against the Euro.
 Ancillary revenues increased 36% to EUR71.0m, a faster growth rate than passenger volumes, reflecting a 
strong performance in non-flight scheduled revenues, on-board sales and other ancillary products. 
Ancillary revenues continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes and remain at 13% of total 
revenues compared to the same period last year.
 Total operating expenses increased by 41% to EUR339.3m due to the increased level of activity, and the 
increased costs primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route charges and airport and handling costs associated 
with the growth of the airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by an increase in the 
average sector length, whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partially offset by the strength of the Euro 
exchange rate against the US$.
 Staff costs have increased by 18% to EUR41.5m primarily due to a 14% increase in average employee numbers 
to 2,876 and the impact of pay increases of 3% compared to the previous quarter ended September 30, 2004.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 22% to EUR26.1m. A higher depreciation charge due to an 
increase in the size of the 'owned' fleet from 66 to 74, offset by a lower amortisation charge due to the 
retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the positive impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of 
amortisation of 737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the Euro to US$ also had a positive impact on the 
depreciation and amortisation charge relating to new aircraft deliveries.
 Fuel costs rose by 105% to EUR127.0m due to an increase in the number of sectors flown, an 8% increase in 
sector length, and a significantly higher average US$ cost per gallon of fuel partially offset by the 
positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the US$ during the period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -6-
 Maintenance costs increased by 4% to EUR11.2m reflecting the improved reliability arising from the higher 
proportion of 737-800 operated and a lower level of maintenance costs incurred due to the return of six 
737-300's and the positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro exchange rate, partially offset by an 
increase in the number of leased 737-800 aircraft from 10 to 17.
 Marketing and distribution costsdecreased by 3% to EUR3.4m due to the reduction in the level of marketing 
activity and related expenditure compared to the previous year.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 31% to EUR10.7m reflecting an additional 7 aircraft on lease during 
the quarter offset by the savings arising from the return of 6 737-300's to ILFC.
 Route charges increased by 23% to EUR42.6m due to an increase in the number of sectors flown and an 
increase of 8% in the average sector length, offset by a reduction in enroute charges in certain EU 
countries.
 Airport and handling charges increased by 20% to EUR55.5m, which was slower than the growth in passenger 
volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at certain existing airports offset by lower costs and 
new airports and bases, and the strengthening of the Euro exchange rate against Sterling.
 Other expenses increased by 17% to EUR21.5m, which is lower than the growth in ancillary revenues due to 
improved margins on some existing products, and cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
 Operating margins have declined by 5 points to 37% due to the reasons outlined above whilst operating 
profits have increased by 18% to EUR202.2m during the quarter.
 Interest receivable has increased by EUR2.4m to EUR9.2m for the quarter due to the combined impact of 
higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and increases in average deposit rates earned in the quarter 
compared to last year.
 Interest payable increased by EUR5.1m to EUR18.4m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the purchase 
of new aircraft.
 Foreign exchange losses have decreased during the quarter to EUR0.5m due to the positive impact of 
changes in the Sterling exchange rate against the Euro compared to last year.
 Notes to the Financial Statements
 1.  Accounting Policies
 This period's financial information has been prepared on the basis of the recognition and measurement 
requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") in issue that either are adopted by 
the EU and effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March 2006 or are expected to be adopted and 
effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March 2006, the Group's first annual reporting date at 
which it is required to use accounting standards adopted by the EU.  Based on these recognition and 
measurement requirements, management has made assumptions about the accounting policies expected to be 
applied, when the first annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting standards 
adopted by the EU for the financial year ending 31 March 2006.   These preliminary accounting policies are 
set out in the document titled "Explanation of the financial impact following adoption of IFRS" published 
in August 2005 with the first quarter financial results.
 2.  Approval of the Preliminary Announcement
 The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the half year ended Sept 30, 2005 
on November 4th, 2005.
 3.  Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
 The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the half year ended Sept 30, 2005  and the 
comparative period are based on the results reported under the group's preliminary IFRS accounting 
policies, as adjusted certain for exceptional items.
 4.       Ancillary Products and Services
 In order to more accurately reflect the structure of certain ancillary contracts and to provide more 
meaningful information to users the Group has taken the opportunity to reclassify certain ancillary 
revenues and costs (primarily car hire and travel insurance). This has resulted in a reduction in revenues 
of EUR19.9 million with a corresponding reduction in costs in the period ended 30 September 2005 (30 
September 2004: EUR10.8 million). This has resulted in an increase in net margin of 0.5% to 25.1% in the 
period ended 30 September 2005 (30 September 2004 0.4% to 28.3%). Going forward the Group intends to 
report ancillary revenues and costs on a basis consistent with the treatment described herein."
 Independent review report to Ryanair Holdings plc for the six months ended 30 September 2005
 Introduction
 We have been instructed by the company to review the consolidated balance sheet of Ryanair Holdings plc 
at 30 September 2005 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' funds - 
equity and cash flows for the six month period then ended and the related notes as set out on pages 1 to 
7.  We have read the other information contained in the interim report and considered whether it contains 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial information.
 Directors' responsibilities
 The interim report, including the financial information contained therein, is the responsibility of, and 
has been approved by, the directors.  The directors are responsible for preparing the interim report in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -6-
accordance with the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange which require that the accounting policies 
and presentation applied to the interim figures should be consistent with those applied in preparing the 
preceding annual accounts except where there are any changes, and the reasons for them, are disclosed.  As 
explained in note 3 to the document published by Ryanair on 2nd August 2005, entitled "Explanation of the 
Financial Impact Following the Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards", EU law requires 
that the next annual consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with 
accounting standards adopted for use in the European Union further to IAS Regulation (EC 1606/2002).  
Therefore this interim financial information has been prepared on the basis of the recognition and 
measurement requirements of IFRS's in issue that either are adopted by the EU and effective (or available 
for early adoption) at 31 March 2006 or are expected to be adopted and effective (or available for early 
adoption) at 31 March 2006.

 Supply remains finite from both the occupiers' and the investors' points of view.  The planning 
environment is becoming even more restrictive including the proposal to bring the construction of 
mezzanine floors under planning control.
 Meanwhile, occupational demand continues to grow.  As a result rents have shown strong growth and are 
forecast to continue to do so.  These factors have all combined to produce a very competitive investment 
market.
 A notable trend has been the increased demand from investors for older schemes benefiting from relatively 
open A1 planning consents.  These can be refurbished, established tenants relocated, and new fashion or 
other high street tenants substituted, often producing dramatic uplift in rents.
 Out of town food stores have also continued to see good rental growth; particularly from favourable rent 
review settlements.  Accordingly, investors are prepared to accept low initial yields, even for shorter 
income streams, as there is ample evidence that traders are willing to renew or extend leases in good 
trading locations.
 Shopping Centres and High Street Retail
 Retailers continue to experience mixed fortunes.  Although there are few signs of consumers reducing 
their expenditure, retailer margins remain under pressure.
 However yields have sharpened, reflecting the strength of demand for property and, in the case of 
centres, the scope for enhancing returns through asset management.
 As with all sectors, yield compression has occurred such that the difference between prime and secondary 
or even tertiary schemes has narrowed.  Consequently, some investors who purchased one or two years ago 
are now realising profits.

 AFPLATS - RESULT OF EGM
 African Platinum plc ("Afplats") announces that at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held earlier 
today the ordinary resolution put to shareholders was, notwithstanding the Board's unanimous recommendation to 
the contrary, duly carried, and therefore that Mr. Charles Hansard is no longer a director of Afplats.
 The Board has also been informed by Dr. Mark Bristow that he is resigning as an independent non-executive 
director with effect from close of business, Friday 4 August 2006 as he does not agree with this removal of Mr. 
Charles Hansard as a director and is resigning on principle.
 The Board has now decided to appoint Mr. Brian Moritz as chairman on an interim basis.  The Board intends to 
appoint a chairman on a permanent basis and to consider external candidates for this purpose.
 The Board continues to believe Afplats has a strong platform for growth.
 A summary of the votes exercised at the meeting was as follows:

 Autocascade will offer remarketing systems and services to the automotive industry. This will enable fleet owners, 
including ourselves, to maximise yield on vehicle disposals through higher residual values and lower distribution 
costs. Autocascade is designed to leverage the significant development potential of the B2B market - initially in the 
UK, but with plans for European expansion.
 The exceptional charge of Euro 3.6 million relates to yourautochoice.com and this restructuring of our interests in 
the on-line remarketing of motor vehicles.
 Centrus (3 Arrows)
 Our 3 Arrows subsidiary, which accounts for approximately 4% of Group revenues, was repositioned earlier this 
year to operate within the Association of British Insurers third party hire initiative which provides a framework for the 
services charged at lower rates but faster settlement. Following agreements reached earlier this year, the detailed 
process of settlement of historic debt is progressing and levels are expected to reduce significantly by the end of 
the year. Recently rebranded Centrus, a number of major new accounts were secured during the first half and 
trends in monthly hire starts have increased an average of 37% in the 3 months to end August 2001.
 Summary and outlook
 "Despite extremely challenging market conditions, the Group continued to achieve double-digit revenue growth in 
key markets except Germany. The German market remains difficult and we continue to focus on improving yield, 
together with actions to further reduce costs. Underlying Group operating margins remained strong and actions to 
contain fleet costs are beginning to deliver benefits.
 Revenue growth trends in the first half have continued into the peak months of July and August, despite weakness 
in the US economy and slowing European GDP growth. Although general economic uncertainty remains, we expect 
these levels of growth to continue for the balance of the year, assuming no further marked deterioration in the 
economic environment.

 It is extraordinary for the Aer Lingus board to claim that Ryanair's Offer "significantly undervalues" 
Aer Lingus when Ryanair's EUR2.80 offer per share represents a 27% premium to the EUR2.20 per share 
valuation which the board of Aer Lingus agreed just 8 days previously.
 Minister Cullen's statement 6th October 2006
 Taking just a few of the points made by Minister Cullen in his statement, Ryanair responds as
 follows:
 (a)          "...I do not consider that the Government's and Ireland's strategic objectives would be well 
served by a takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair."
 Ryanair believes that its proposal represents Aer Lingus' best opportunity to remain an Irish 
headquartered, managed, controlled and regulated airline, fully focused on Irish strategic objectives. 
Ryanair's Offer clearly meets the Government's strategy by securing the future of Aer Lingus, retaining 
the Heathrow slots and Aer Lingus' branding. Ryanair's Offer - if accepted - will establish one strong 
Irish airline group (as there is in the UK (BA), Germany (Lufthansa) and France (Air France)) which 
clearly meets Ireland's strategic objectives.
 (b)           "The IPO means that Aer Lingus is better positioned than ever in the past, to grow and 
develop
 its business and to minimise the opportunities for competitors."
 If Ryanair's Offer fails, Aer Lingus will continue to be under the de facto control of the Government and 
unions. Given this Government's track record on aviation and transport issues generally (ranging from the 
state monopolies of Dublin Airport Authority, Dublin Bus, and CIE and all points between) this will mean 
that the dead hand of anti-competitive, monopolistic and anti-consumer policies continues to drag down Aer 
Lingus. Ryanair finds it unusual that the Minister now confirms that the rationale for the IPO of Aer 
Lingus was to "minimise the opportunities for competitors".
 (c)           "Delivering a single airline group as Ryanair suggests will not deliver the benefits to the 
Irish
 consumer that Ryanair has suggested."
 This claim is without foundation given that Ryanair's Offer, if successful, commits it to reducing Aer 
Lingus' fares by 21/2% per year for a minimum period of 4 years and reducing the fuel surcharge, both of 
which are clearly of benefit to, and have the support of, consumers.
 (d)           ".consumer interests are best served by having a variety of product offerings that meet the
 requirements of different segments of the market and our policy in respect of airlines and airports
 has been developed to deliver this and to facilitate flexibility and choice for the consumer."
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -2-
 Ryanair's Offer for Aer Lingus guarantees that Aer Lingus and Ryanair will continue to be run and managed 
separately, serving different market segments, with different product offerings. The combination of 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus will still find it difficult to advance consumer interests when dealing with 
uncompetitive monopolies, such as the DAA, which are owned, protected and operated by the Minister for 
Transport. The DAA currently proposes to increase passenger charges by 60% at Dublin Airport.
 (e)           "The Ryanair low-cost model has transformed the aviation experience for consumers and 
nowhere more than Ireland."
 For all of the reasons set out in this announcement and as our proven track record clearly demonstrates, 
Ryanair believes that our generous offer for Aer Lingus will ensure that Aer Lingus' customers will in 
future enjoy and benefit from our plan to lower fares and improve services in a stand alone, separately 
managed Aer Lingus.
 Ryanair's Cash Offer delivers excellent value for Aer Lingus' Shareholders whilst ensuring that the price 
on offer is one which will enable Ryanair to continue to realise its objective of developing Aer Lingus, 
lowering fares and advancing the best interests of Irish and European consumers.
 Full details of the Cash Offer, including the terms and conditions under which it is being made, will be 
posted to Aer Lingus shareholders on Monday next, 23(rd) October 2006.  The Cash Offer is conditional, 
amongst other things, upon acceptances being received in respect of more than 50% of the Aer Lingus Shares 
the subject of the Offer, including any Aer Lingus Shares beneficially owned or controlled by Ryanair.
 Full details for enquiries are printed at the end of this announcement:
 THE RYANAIR CASH OFFER
 Ryanair's generous cash offer
 1.         EUR2.80 is an excellent offer
 Ryanair's Offer of EUR2.80 in cash per Aer Lingus Share values Aer Lingus Group plc at approximately 
EUR1.481bn compared to its flotation value of EUR1.163bn just 8 days prior to Ryanair's Offer.
 2.         27% premium in just 1 week
 The Offer represents a premium of approx 27% over the IPO price of Aer Lingus (EUR2.20) which was agreed 
as an appropriate value by the Government of Ireland, the Board of Aer Lingus, the ESOT and their 
respective advisers, on 27 September - just 8 days prior to Ryanair's Offer.
 3.         Ryanair's bid is supporting an inflated share price
 If the Offer is not accepted, there is a likelihood that the share price of Aer Lingus will fall 
significantly. During the two days (Mon 2nd and Tue 3rd October) when Ryanair was not actively buying in 
the market, the Aer Lingus share price fell from EUR2.48 to EUR2.44, and from EUR2.44 to EUR2.41.
 4.         Government to realise over EUR500m
 If the Offer is accepted, the Irish Government will realise a total of over EUR500m from the sale of its 
stake in Aer Lingus, an enormous return from an airline which was, by its own admission, on the edge of 
bankruptcy just four years ago.
 5.         Aer Lingus employees realise an average of over EUR60k each - tax free structure for ESOT
 If the Offer is accepted, Aer Lingus employees stand to realise over EUR220m, which equates to an average 
of over EUR60,000 per employee, and there is a mechanism which would allow ESOT Members to realise the 
proceeds of the shares held by the ESOT on a tax free basis.
 6.         Volatile earnings record of Aer Lingus
 Aer Lingus is an airline with a volatile earnings record which came close to bankruptcy four years ago, 
and whose cumulative losses (EUR616m) exceeded its cumulative profits (EUR433m) over the past 14 years by 
over EUR180m.  Aer Lingus' earnings prospects will be enhanced by acceptance of the Ryanair Offer.
 7.         Ryanair's Offer will not lead to a monopoly
 Ryanair's Offer commits to maintaining Aer Lingus as a stand-alone separate airline. The two airlines 
will compete vigorously, therefore this will not lead to a monopoly. Aer Lingus' IPO document confirms 
that there is little crossover because Ryanair and Aer Lingus only compete on about 17 of more than 500 
combined routes (Source: IPO Prospectus, p79).
 Whilst Ryanair and Aer Lingus together account for 61% of aircraft movements at Dublin Airport, this is 
not dissimilar to other large airline groupings at other European airports. For instance, SAS and its 
Lufthansa partners have over 85% of seats in Copenhagen, Austrian and its Lufthansa partners have over 70% 
of movements in Vienna, Olympic has over 73% of seats in Athens, TAP and its Star Alliance Partners have 
60% of seats in Lisbon, Air France and its Sky Team Associates have 62% of movements in Charles de Gaulle, 
and Lufthansa and its Star Alliance Partners have 67% of movements in Munich.
 In addition, Dublin continues to be served by over 50 other scheduled airlines currently serving 112 
international destinations, each of which is free to open new routes and increase services at Dublin 
should they so wish. Some of these airlines are significantly larger than the Ryanair/Aer Lingus 
combination would be (e.g. British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France/KLM). Moreover, these airlines can be 
joined by other airlines who wish to enter or grow the market as Ryanair continues to do.
 8.         Good for competition and good for consumers
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -2-
 During the 6 months to 30 June 2006, Aer Lingus' average short haul fare increased by 2% to EUR86.49. 
This is in line with Aer Lingus' stated strategy to "Maximise Passenger Revenues" (Source: IPO Prospectus, 
p71). Similarly, Aer Lingus has recently refused to reduce its fuel surcharge despite recent falls in oil 
prices (Source: Irish Independent, 4 October 2006). Rising fares and high fuel surcharges are bad for 
competition and bad for consumers.
 By contrast, Ryanair's Offer guarantees to reduce Aer Lingus' short haul fares by 2.5% per year for a 
minimum period of 4 years and to reduce Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as oil prices fall. Lower fares and 
lower surcharges will be good for consumers. Ryanair's Offer will therefore increase competition and lower 
prices which is good for consumers and should stimulate growth.
 YOUR ALTERNATIVE (IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE CASH OFFER)
 AER LINGUS FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS A SMALL REGIONAL AIRLINE
 IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WITH A HIGH FARE STRUCTURE
 AND AN UNCOMPETITIVE COST BASE.
 SUSTAINABILITY OF AER LINGUS PROFITABILITY IS UNCERTAIN
 1.     Aer Lingus' short haul fares are uncompetitive
 Aer Lingus' average short haul fare of EUR87.55 is hopelessly uncompetitive in the face of Ryanair's 
average equivalent of EUR41.23. As a result, Aer Lingus has seen its share of traffic between Ireland and 
the UK collapse in recent years as highlighted in the table below.
Aer Lingus' Share of Traffic

Adjusted earnings per share is presented to help understand the underlying performance of the Group. The 
adjustments in 2005 are items that do not reflect the underlying business performance. As IAS 39 and IFRS 4 have 
been implemented with effect from 1 January 2005, the adjustments in 2004 reflect the impact that these standards 
would have had on the effective interest rate and insurance business had they been applied from 1 January 2004.

In 2004 the Group changed the presentation of income from bonuses received from suppliers for meeting certain 
turnover levels. Previously the Group presented the income in the financial activities. Since the financial statements 
prepared for the first half of 2004 the Group decreases the cost of sales by the amount of bonuses received. In 
order to ensure comparability the Group changed the presentation for the first half of 2003. The amount of 
reclassified bonuses relating to the first half of 2003 was PLN 1,001 thousand.

Body
 The financial information contained in this announcement does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in 
Section 240 of the Companies Act 1985 and is unaudited.  NP Statutory accounts for 2004 prepared under UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.  The 
auditors have reported on those 2004 accounts; their report was unqualified and did not contain statements under 
s.237(2) or (3) Companies Act 1985.
 2.  Earnings per Share
 The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year after taxation of GBP31,098,000 
(2004: Loss GBP6,894,000) and 123,004,284 (2004 - 110,189,645) ordinary shares, being the weighted average 
number of shares in issue for the year.
 The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on an adjusted profit for the year after taxation as adjusted 
for the assumed conversion of convertible debt.  The number of shares outstanding, however, is adjusted to show 
the potential dilution of the conversion of convertible debt and of employee and other share options being converted 
into ordinary shares.  The weighted average number of ordinary shares is therefore increased by 8,227,621 (2004: 
nil) in respect of the share option scheme, resulting in a diluted weighted average number of shares of 131,231,905 
(2004: 110,189,645).
 The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based upon the following:

 3.  Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
 The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 and the comparative 
quarter are based on the results reported under the group's IFRS accounting policies, as adjusted for certain 
exceptional items.
 4.  Accounting for Aircraft Spare Parts Maintenance
 Under IAS 16 spare parts held by an entity are classified as Property, Plant and Equipment if they are expected to 
be used for more than one period.  In this quarter's financial information this has resulted in a reclassification of the 
maintenance expense incurred relating to the stock of spare aircraft parts owned from "Maintenance, materials and 
repairs" to "Depreciation and amortisation".
 5.  Accounting for Share-Based Payments
 Under SFAS No. 123R, which was adopted by the Company on April 1, 2006, the Company is required to account 
for share-based employee compensation using a fair value based method.  The Company has elected to use the 
Binomial Lattice option pricing model to determine the fair-value of share-based awards under SFAS No. 123R, 
consistent with that previously used for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123 ("Accounting for Stock-Based 
Compensation").
 The Company has elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123R and 
accordingly prior quarter's have not been restated to reflect the impact of the revised standard.  In this quarter's 
financial information, the Company has, as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, recorded incremental share-
based compensation expense of EUR1.043 million in its US GAAP income statement.
 Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company measured compensation expense for its employee share-
based compensation plans using the intrinsic method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25.  The Company applied 
the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, as if the fair value based method has been applied in measuring 
compensation expense.  Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Group's employee share 
options was equal to the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, no compensation expense was 
recognised.  If the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to share-based 
compensation during the three month quarter ended June 30, 2005, reported income under US GAAP would have 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Qtr Rlt Original HTML -6-
been reduced by EUR0.291m from EUR71.041m to EUR70.750m with resulting Net income per ADS, basic and 
diluted, of 46.51 Euro cent and 46.33 Euro cent respectively.

(1) The business segment information is based on management accounts information. Income on capital is 
allocated to the divisions on the basis of the capital required to support the level of risk weighted assets. Interest 
income earned on capital not allocated to divisions is reported in Group.
 (2) The fungible nature of liabilities within the banking industry inevitably leads to allocations of liabilities to 
segments, some of which are necessarily subjective. Accordingly, the directors believe that the analysis of total 
assets is more meaningful than the analysis of net assets.
 (3) The geographical distribution of profit before taxation is based primarily on the location of the office recording 
the transaction.

The purchase consideration for the acquisition of CellMed AG included the following:
 Deferred consideration
 The deferred shares consideration, representing a fixed number of shares, totalled GBP3.9 million at acquisition 
and was revalued at the balance sheet date using the market bid price of the shares, which resulted in a reduction 
to the fair value of the shares to be issued of GBP0.7 million.
 Contingent consideration
 The total consideration included contingent consideration which may become payable in shares and cash 
calculated on cash received from the commercialisation of certain intellectual property.  The Company has not 
valued this consideration because: due to the early clinical stage of the programme, it does not believe the 
consideration to be probable and; due to the ground-breaking nature of the programme, it is not able to measure 
the consideration reliably.  The maximum contingent consideration payable is EUR3.6 million in cash and the issue 
of 2.4 million shares.
 Put option
 A put option was negotiated which allows the Company to sell the CellMed AG share capital acquired back to the 
original holders at two dates: 30 June 2006 and 31 December 2006.  The option was included as a means of 
mitigating risk in the acquisition to protect the Company in the event that the company's programmes did not 
proceed according to plan.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0237A -24-
thousand and provision for deferred tax in the amount of PLN 1,473 thousand. The Group does not compensate 
deferred tax assets and provisions for deferred tax relating to different companies.
 Major items of provision for deferred tax relate to the valuation of long-term contracts. The provision made by the 
Parent Company because of valuation of long-term contracts amounted to PLN 13,551 thousand as at 30 June 
2004.
 The positive temporary differences in income tax are expected to expire in the long-term.

 3 million sq ft London Offices - developments carefully timed and customer focused
 Our London office development programme represents the best way to meet customer needs in this sector, with 
high quality buildings of architectural merit in the right locations, offering flexible, efficient floor plates and an 
attractive working environment.  In turn, the economics are more attractive to us than the current investment market 
offers.  We expect office rental growth to generate higher rents during 2007-2009 and our developments should be 
well timed for delivery into this improving market.
 The Willis Building, EC3, was 'topped out' in September and is on programme for completion in early 2007.  The 
offices at York House, W1 have reached practical completion on time and within budget; we are now fitting out the 
c. 40,000 sq ft to be occupied as our new head office.  The residential apartments at York House are scheduled for 
practical completion at the end of this calendar year.  Construction of 201 Bishopsgate and The Broadgate Tower 
are also progressing well with the steel frame for the tower reaching level 20 - and making its mark on the London 
skyline.  The design is energy efficient and is expected to produce a significantly lower level of emissions than is 
required by current building regulations.
 At Ropemaker Place, EC2, piling and preparation works are proceeding.  The redesigns for the new development 
are in hand and we are submitting a revised planning application for a larger, more efficient building to provide 
590,000 sq ft of prime office and ancillary space on this 1.2 acre island site.

 The next phase of the development of the Regent's Place, NW1 estate will be to provide 380,000 sq ft of offices 
and 110,000 sq ft of residential accommodation at Osnaburgh Street in the West End.  We have now acquired the 
remaining freehold interest from The Crown Estate, enabling construction to begin in early 2007.
 2.3 million sq ft retail - new projects in UK and Spain
 Giltbrook Retail Park, Nottingham is a retail warehouse scheme of 60,000 sq ft let to Decathlon and Next, and a 
site of 20.8 acres opposite with an existing planning consent for a further 150,000 sq ft of retail and 75,000 sq ft of 
industrial/office accommodation.  We have been working on the project design and following local consultations 
have recently submitted a revised planning application for a 240,000 sq ft mixed use retail, industrial and office 
scheme, with improved environmental attributes.  With the new park expected to complete in 2008, anchored by an 
adjacent existing IKEA store, we expect this to become an important regional retail destination.
 Our Joint Venture development of Puerto Venecia is under way at Zaragoza, to create a retail warehouse park, a 
specialist retail and leisure scheme and a shopping centre (with ancillary facilities), in total 195,000 sq m (2.1 million 
sq ft).  Infrastructure works have begun and IKEA is progressing well with the construction of its store, expected to 
open for trading mid-2007 to anchor the retail park.  Further anchor tenants agreed for the schemes include the 
major retailers Leroy Merlin, Decathlon, Porcelanosa and Conforama.

 Portfolio valuation
 The table below shows principal valuation movements for both the three months and the six months to 30 
September  2006 by sector for our GBP15.9 billion portfolio.  All sectors improved in value.
 The 6.2% uplift for the six months was comparable with that reported by IPD for the market overall (after 
adjustment for differences in calculation method, including time weighting).  Contributing to the uplift was like for like 
growth in rental value (ERV) for the portfolio ahead of the market at 2.8%.  The net equivalent yield (after notional 
purchasers' costs) on the portfolio has also tightened by 16 bps to 4.7% during the six months.
 The main sector drivers of the valuation increase over the six months were:

Highlights
 --     Turnover and operating profit increased in each of the Group's three lines of business.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0069A
 --     Increased operating profit in Process Gas Solutions was driven by the increased contribution from 
new projects, increased merchant volumes, firm pricing and by improved business efficiency leading to 
lower costs.
 --     An underlying improvement in Industrial and Special Products' operating profit was further 
strengthened by favourable movements in the South African rand and Australian dollar exchange rates.
 --     BOC Edwards' operating profit increased, reflecting improved semiconductor equipment and gases 
sales as well as cost reductions.
 --     The performance of Afrox hospitals also improved and the results were further boosted by a 
favourable exchange rate movement.
 --     Gist achieved flat operating profit despite the loss of general merchandise business for Marks & 
Spencer that was announced last year.
 --     Profit before tax increased faster than operating profit, benefiting from lower interest on net 
debt and a higher net pension credit.
 Chief executive, Tony Isaac, said
 'We are now beginning to benefit from an upturn in trading conditions around the world. Our margins were 
helped by firm pricing as well as business efficiency and cost saving programmes. Cash flow is strong and 
the changes we are making to our business portfolio with recent acquisitions and planned disposals will 
further strengthen the Group.'

PROCESS GAS SOLUTIONS (PGS)
 The increase in turnover reflected a generally improving economic environment as well as additional sales of Linde 
BOC Process Plants compared with a year ago, the effect of higher natural gas prices on turnover in Mexico and 
the acquisition of the water services business in late October 2002. Excluding these elements, which had little 
impact on operating profit, the increase in turnover was 5 per cent.
 Firm pricing trends coupled with greater business efficiency led to the higher growth of adjusted operating profit.
 Increased demand for nitrogen, particularly for food freezing, led to an overall improvement in US nitrogen 
volumes. New business at Celanese Clear Lake, Texas, and with Citgo at Lemont, Illinois, also contributed to an 
overall increase in turnover and adjusted operating profit. However, turnover comparisons in north America 
continued to be affected by reduced volumes of oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide to certain customers as reported 
in May last year.
 In Europe, tonnage and merchant volumes improved across a broad range of customers leading to increased 
turnover. The impact of customer relocations and closures in the UK was significantly reduced and there was a 
better trading environment in the first quarter.
 The increased turnover coupled with cost savings in plant operations and distribution led to a significant 
improvement in adjusted operating profit in Europe.
 Increased demand from steel customers and in the general merchant business in south China was reflected in 
turnover growth and a more significant increase in adjusted operating profit from north Asia.

 INDUSTRIAL AND SPECIAL PRODUCTS (ISP)
 Growth of both turnover and adjusted operating profit on a constant currency basis reflected better industrial 
activity in most markets. This growth was further strengthened upon translation of overseas results into sterling.
 The acquisitions of businesses in Poland and Canada contributed to the growth of turnover and adjusted operating 
profit during the first quarter.
 Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in Europe as a result of the integration of the Polish acquisition, 
additional helium business and the growth of medical gases revenues.
 Manufacturing activity increased in Australia leading to better sales volumes. At the same time prices remained 
firm and the business mix was favourable, resulting in a significant increase in adjusted operating profit. Colder 
weather than a year ago and improved margins led to an increased adjusted operating profit in the liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG) business.
 The stronger South African rand was favourable to the translation of results but it affected export volumes and 
there was a slowdown in manufacturing during the first quarter leading to somewhat lower turnover. Despite this, 
margins improved for most products including LPG so that adjusted operating profit was similar to a year ago.
 Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in Latin America with volume growth supported by strong pricing 
trends and the recent acquisition of an LPG distributor in Colombia.
 On a global basis, medical products, helium and packaged chemicals benefited from both volume growth and firm 
pricing trends.
 BOC has announced its intention to sell its US packaged gas business, which generated annual turnover of 
approximately USD 240 million in 2003, to Airgas Inc for up to USD 200 million in cash. The transaction remains 
subject to a definitive agreement and customary conditions, including financing and US antitrust approval.
 The transaction will be earnings enhancing for BOC in the year immediately following completion. The balance of 
the ISP business in the US including helium, bulk medical gases, tube-trailer hydrogen and bulk gas supplies to 
distributors will be excluded from the disposal. This part of the business had annual turnover in excess of USD 200 
million in 2003.
 BOC EDWARDS
 After an improvement in semiconductor equipment orders in the fourth quarter, there was a further sequential 
improvement in both turnover and adjusted operating profit in the first quarter.
 Following earlier concern about the potential sustainability of an emerging upturn in the semiconductor industry, 
sentiment is strengthening. There was another increase in semiconductor equipment order intake during the 
quarter.
 Electronic materials revenues increased in all regions but particularly so in Asia. Demand for nitrogen trifluoride 
(NF3) picked up in Taiwan and production was more than doubled compared with the previous quarter.
 Vacuum equipment sales improved further in the first quarter with a particularly strong trend in Asia. US sales of 
turbomolecular pumps for on-tool applications increased and demand in Asia was strengthened by the expansion of 
flat panel display manufacturing.
 The US dollar is BOC Edwards' major revenue currency but manufacturing costs are mainly in sterling. The 
movement in the dollar exchange rate therefore affects margins. Adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 
2004 would have been approximately GBP4 million more at the exchange rates of a year ago. If the current dollar 
exchange rate persists there will be a similar negative transaction impact on each of the remaining quarters of this 
year.

(1) The results and financial position for the year ended 31 December 2004 have been restated to represent the 
results of Ark Life as a discontinued operation to reflect the disposal (note 3) and the application of International 
Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'), with the exception of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 which apply with effect 
from 1 January 2005 (see Basis of preparation on page 23). The historical information has not been restated for 
IFRS and is therefore presented as previously reported under Irish GAAP. Thus the five year trends will not be 
entirely comparable.
 (2) Excluding the impact of the exceptional foreign exchange dealing losses, the return on average total assets was 
1.23% and the return on average ordinary shareholders' equity was 20.4%.
 (3) Excluding the impact of the deposit interest retention tax settlement, the return on average total assets was 
1.26% and the return on average ordinary shareholders' equity was 19.5%.

(1) On transition to IFRS, at 1 January 2005, IAS 39 requires the recognition of a liability for acceptances from the 
date of acceptance. A corresponding asset due from the originator is also recognised. Under Irish GAAP, 
acceptances were accounted for on a net basis and shown as a contingent liability.
 The Group's maximum exposure to credit loss under contingent liabilities and commitments to extend credit, in the 
event of non-performance by the other party where all counterclaims, collateral or security prove valueless, is 
represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments.

commitments as it does for on balance sheet lending including counterparty credit approval, limit setting and 
monitoring procedures. In addition, in relation to derivative instruments, the Group's exposure to market risk is 
controlled within the risk limits in the Group's Interest Rate Risk and Foreign Exchange Risk Policies and is further 
constrained by the risk parameters incorporated in the Group's Derivatives Policy as approved by the Board.

Notes
 19 Long-term assurance business (continued)
 Presentation in the Group balance sheet
 Holdings of shares in Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c., (by the parent or subsidiary companies), for any reason, are 
deducted in arriving at shareholders' equity. At 31 December 2005, shares in AIB with a value of EUR 77m (2004: 
EUR 74m) were held within the long-term business funds to meet the liabilities to policyholders.
 Long-term assurance assets attributable to policyholders are presented in the Group balance sheet net of the 
carrying value of the shares in AIB held within the fund. Group shareholders' funds have been reduced by a similar 
amount.

Body
 At a time when the overwhelming majority of major European airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa 
and Air France, have moved from government to private ownership through stock market flotations, the 
future of Aer Lingus, and so your investment, can only be damaged if the Irish government and employee 
interests continue to maintain de facto control of Aer Lingus in the event of this bid not succeeding.
 APPENDIX
 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE CASH OFFER REGARDING THE ESOT/APSS
 If accepted, the Cash Offer would result in ESOT Members realising over EUR186 million for their Aer 
Lingus Shares, which equates to an estimated average of EUR60,000 per ESOT Member.
 These members can realise this money on a tax free basis, as explained below.
 The Irish Revenue Commissioners will, on a concessional basis, normally permit the reinvestment of all 
ESOT cash proceeds in Ryanair Shares without incurring a liability to tax. This concession is subject to 
formal Revenue approval. The availability of this tax free treatment in respect of shares held in the ESOT 
will require majority approval of ESOT Members.
 Assuming an entitlement of EUR60,000, if the ESOT reinvests in Ryanair Shares as set out above, Ryanair 
Shares to the value of EUR25,400 can be released tax free to ESOT Members by the end of August 2007 (if 
shares are allocated to the APSS in 2006) or by January 2008 (if no shares are allocated to the APSS until 
2007). On release these members could immediately sell their shares in the market for up to EUR25,400 tax 
free.
 Further allocations up to EUR12,700 can be made for subsequent tax years until all the shares have been 
appropriated - these shares can be released tax free to ESOT Members, the precise timing of such 
allocations and releases will be dependant on a number of factors, including satisfaction of the requisite 
3 year hold period.
 This structure would enable ESOT Members to receive tax free proceeds, subject to the then value of 
Ryanair Shares, of up to EUR25,400 by August 2007 or January 2008 and of EUR34,600 in subsequent tax 
years.
 On release from trust, ESOT Members would be free to sell their Ryanair Shares on the market to realise 
cash.
 The calculations of ESOT entitlements in this announcement are based on the ESOT's shareholding assuming 
exercise of the ESOT Option and assuming 3,200 ESOT Members. References to amounts Aer Lingus employees' 
may realise assume reinvestment of the cash proceeds acquired by the ESOT in Ryanair Shares as outlined 
above and do not take into account any tax consequences which may apply to any employees or former 
employees. It is also assumed that the Aer Lingus Shares held by the APSS at Admission and Aer Lingus

Shares acquired by employees and former employees since that date have not been disposed of. The above is 
a summary of the Irish tax considerations that may apply. The comments are intended only as a general 
guide and do not constitute tax advice. You are recommended to seek your own personal financial and 
taxation advice.
 This announcement does not constitute an offer or an invitation to offer to purchase or subscribe for any

 The directors of Ryanair accept responsibility for the information contained in this announcement, save

in this announcement relating to Aer Lingus and the Aer Lingus Group, which has been compiled from 
published sources, has been to ensure that such information has been correctly and fairly reproduced or 
presented (and no steps have been taken by the directors of Ryanair to verify this information). To the 
best of the knowledge and belief of the directors of Ryanair (who have taken all reasonable care to ensure 
that such is the case), the information contained in this announcement for which they accept

words 'will', 'may', 'should', 'could', 'would', 'can', 'continue', 'opportunity', 'believes', 'expects', 
'intends', 'anticipates', 'estimates' or similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The 
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Many of these risks and uncertainties 
relate to factors that are beyond the companies' abilities to control or estimate precisely, such as 
future market conditions and the behaviours of other market participants, and therefore undue reliance 
should not be placed on such statements. Ryanair assumes no obligation in respect of, nor intends to 
update these forward-looking statements, except as required pursuant to applicable law.
 Any person who is the holder of 1 per cent. or more of any class of shares in Aer Lingus or Ryanair may

 Notes
 3 Disposal of Ark Life Assurance Company Limited ('Ark Life'). Acquisition of an interest of 24.99% in Hibernian 
Life Holdings Limited (continued)
 Under IFRS 5, 'Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations', the income and expenses of Ark Life 
for December 2005 and December 2004 of the operations deemed to be disposed of have been reported net of 
taxation as a discontinued operation below profit after taxation. The impact of the December 2004 restatement on 
the previously reported figures is outlined below on the Income Statement captions impacted. The assets and 
liabilities of Ark Life (note 19) as at 31 December 2005 have been classified as held for sale and are separate from 
other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. There has been no restatement of prior year balance sheet figures 
as the assets and liabilities were not held for sale at that date.

Notes to the Accounts
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0004A -5-
 For the year ended 31 December 2005
 1.    Basis of preparation The financial information set out above does not constitute the company's 
statutory accounts for the years ended 31 December 2005 or 2004, but is derived from those accounts. 
Statutory accounts for 2004 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2005 will be 
delivered following the company's annual general meeting. The auditors have reported on those accounts; 
their reports were unqualified and did not contain statements under s. 237 (2) or (3) Companies Act 1985.
 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
 The group has applied IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of International financial Reporting Standards, in 
preparing the statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005. Consequently, 2004 comparative 
information has been restated under these new accounting standards from that which was contained in the 
financial statements for the period.
 While the information included in this preliminary announcement has been computed in accordance with 
IFRSs, this announcement does not itself contain sufficient information to comply with IFRSs. The company 
expects to publish full financial statements that comply with IFRSs in April 2006.
 2. Segmental information
 For management purposes, the group is currently organised into three operating divisions - CTC 
Management, CTC Services and CTC Run-off Services.
 Principal activities are as follows:
 CTC Management - Mutual management, captive management, investment management and risk management.
 CTC Services - Energy, Aviation, Non-Marine and Marine (including Average) adjusting.
 CTC Run-off Services - insurance company acquisition and run-off services. The results of insurance 
companies have been shown separately in the segmental information. Segmental information about these 
businesses is presented below:

 CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
 Results and dividend
 The good start to the financial year to which I referred in my AGM statement has continued.  We have 
delivered impressive results in the six months to 28th September 2002.  Total operating profit rose by 11% 
to GBP5.1 million; pre tax profits rose by 9% to GBP4.2 million and underlying earnings per share improved 
by 16% to 14.3 pence.  The interim dividend has therefore been increased by 5% to 3.00 pence and will be 
paid on 4th February 2003 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 10th January 2003.
 Acquisition
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0079A
 In July we purchased the freehold (or virtual freehold) interest in 94 pubs which we had previously 
operated under short leases, through our acquisition of JER UK Public House LLC, an American property 
investment company.   The company was acquired for GBP16.9 m less assumed debt (see note 6).  This 
transaction has been immediately earnings enhancing by replacing rental payments with interest on a new 
GBP17 million loan: a 5 yearly upward only rent review would otherwise have occurred this year.  By owning 
the freeholds, we now have greater control over the management of these properties and we can benefit from 
improved trading through increased value.  Less than 5% of our pubs are now held under short lease.
 Property
 We have continued to add pubs to our estate: as well as 4 tenancies, we acquired 2 managed houses from 
small pub operators: these are high turnover sites adjacent to the student campuses at Salford University 
and the University of North Wales (Bangor).  Both pubs were acquired in time to benefit from the 
university Freshers' Weeks and sales are on target.  They compliment our recent strategic investment in 
student bars.  Further capital investment in the core estate has been made: 22 refurbishment schemes were 
completed, and results are encouraging.
 In accordance with the applicable accounting standard a revaluation of our property portfolio will be 
carried out at the year end.  In line with our strategy of improving the quality of our estate, we are 
currently negotiating the sale of a package of low volume, poor performing tenanted pubs.
 Operating review
 Group turnover fell by 1% or GBP0.2 million; this is due to the termination in August 2001 of an 
unprofitable brewing contract, which remained with Burtonwood when the brewery was transferred to Thomas 
Hardy Burtonwood Limited.  Turnover from ongoing operations, excluding this contract, rose by 2%.  Total 
operating profit rose by 11% to GBP5.1 million.
 TENANTED
 The tenanted estate grew turnover by 6% and profits by 10%, including the benefit of rent savings since 
the JER acquisition in July.  Like for like non invested houses increased profits by 7%.  Beer volumes 
rose and operating margins increased from 35% to 36%.  This strong trading performance benefited from the 
reasonable weather, and in particular, the Indian summer which we enjoyed in September, when turnover was 
over 10% up on the same period last year.  The weekend of the Queen's Golden Jubilee was particularly busy 
in our pubs; our tenants sold more beer at that time than over Christmas period.  Machine income was a 
strong contributor to profit growth again, the benefit of the increased GBP25 jackpot payout still being 
felt.
 20 pubs were refurbished, including major investment at the Radclyffe Arms at Middleton; Queens Head at 
Mold; Ducie Arms in Manchester, Ring O Bells near Cannock, and The George at Hayfield.
 MANAGED
 The managed estate began the year with 35 sites, following a number of transfers to tenancy late last 
year. Nevertheless profits rose and average turnover and EBITDA per house actually rose by 9% and 12%  
respectively. The World Cup provided an opportunity to increase sales and we took it: pubs with big screen 
TV's which opened early for live matches, improved their takings by up to 35%.  2 pubs received capital 
investment.
 Finance Review
 --                     Profit
 Profit before tax rose to GBP4.2 million: this includes our share of the associate's profits of GBP75,000 
and goodwill amortisation of GBP188,000.  The acquisition of JER gave rise to goodwill of GBP644,000
 (see note 6).  The directors have concluded that its useful economic life, being the period over which 
the value of the acquisition is expected to exceed the value of its net assets, is the current financial 
year.  As a result GBP188,000 has been written off in these interim accounts: the balance of GBP456,000 
will be written off during the second half of the year.  For this reason, basic earnings per share fell, 
but adjusting for this goodwill and last year's tax credit, underlying EPS rose by 16% to 14.3 pence.
 --                     Interest
 The interest charge rose to GBP0.9 million, reflecting the new GBP17 million loan.  Interest cover 
remains comfortable at over 5 times.
 --                     Taxation
 The group's effective rate of Corporation tax payable is 29%; including deferred tax, the effective rate 
is 31%.
 --                     Cashflow
 The business produced a healthy operating cashflow of GBP8.2 million (2001 GBP6.4 million).  Investment 
in new and existing pubs amounted to GBP5.4 million.  The acquisition of JER was funded by a secured
 GBP17 million variable rate loan with a 15 year term.  Interest on GBP10 million has been fixed by way of 
a swap.  Net debt at the period end was GBP41 million giving a balance sheet gearing ratio of 46%.

 Our level of involvement has increased during the period such that it has been appropriate to treat our 
investment as an associate.  The accounts therefore include the following amounts representing our 40%

The high speed bottling line was commissioned in April.  After a gradual build up is now being fully utilised to 
package national and international flavoured spirit brands.  Demand from suppliers is buoyant despite the recent 
duty increase.  Brewing volumes are steady.
 People Our property director, Tony Biddle, left the company in October.  I thank Tony for his contribution and wish 
him well.
 A dedicated acquisitions manager is being recruited to continue the search for new pubs.
 Outlook
 As a result of our progress in the first six months and our current sales performance.  I am confident that we will 
have a successful year.

 Key points
 --     Allergy Therapeutics ("The Group") is a fully integrated, specialty pharmaceuticals business 
focused on the treatment and prevention of allergies. The Group was formed in June 1998 following a 
management buy-in ("MBI") of the Bencard allergy vaccine business from SmithKline Beecham.
 --     The Group has a manufacturing, sales & marketing and product development infrastructure supporting 
a portfolio of marketed products and a development pipeline of innovative patented vaccines, focused on 
achieving market approvals from the major regulatory agencies world-wide.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0033A
 --     In the year ended 30 June 2004, the Group made gross sales of approximately GBP19.1 million 
resulting in an operating profit before R&D of GBP2.4m and a net profit of approximately GBP1.2 million.
 --     The treatment of allergies is one of the largest therapeutic areas with estimated related sales of 
over US$12 billion worldwide. In the US alone, it is estimated that between 40 and 60 million people 
suffer from allergies.
 --     The directors believe that capturing maximum market share with allergy vaccines will come by 
improving the characteristics of the products and achieving registrations in major markets. The Group has 
certain exclusive rights world-wide to MPL(R) , a novel vaccine adjuvant. Allergy Therapeutics' short 
course, fast acting, well-tolerated MPL(R) -based vaccines are designed, once registered, to achieve this 
market expansion.
 --     The directors believe that the Group's subcutaneous development products, owing to the extensive 
clinical experience already gained, present low development risk and that an efficacious, convenient 
sublingual allergy vaccine would have the potential to be a first line treatment for allergic disease.
 Commenting on the fundraising and admission to AIM, Keith Carter, Chief Executive of Allergy 
Therapeutics, said:
 "We are delighted by the success of the fundraising.   The response from investors has been very 
positive, which is demonstrated by the fact that the placing was fully subscribed.
 "Since the MBI in 1998 we have focused our efforts on building the infrastructure from which to grow a 
substantial, high value, specialty pharmaceutical business. We believe this foundation has been firmly 
established and supports a profitable core business, robust intellectual property and a late stage 
development pipeline.
 "The proceeds from the placing will be used to accelerate the progress of our MPL(R)-based development 
products through the clinic and to achieve market approvals from the major regulatory agencies world-wide.  
We believe the introduction of efficacious short-course, innovative, registered patent-protected products 
will bring allergy vaccination into mainstream pharmaceutical markets and provide a better alternative to 
the traditional symptomatic treatment of allergies."

vaccine business from SmithKline Beecham (now part of GSK). The Group has a manufacturing, sales and 
marketing and product development infrastructure dedicated to a portfolio of marketed products and a 
pipeline of development products, focused on achieving market approvals from the major regulatory agencies 
world-wide.
 Through its own sales force in Germany, Italy and Spain and indirectly in more than 20 countries, 
including 8 countries through licensing agreements, the Group currently sells and distributes four 
families of vaccine products, injected and sub-lingual, ranging from registered standard seasonal pollen 
allergy vaccinations for common allergens (such as grass and trees) to patient-specific (named-patient 
products). The Group also sells a range of skin-prick diagnostic tests.
 The Group has a history of pioneering innovative short course allergy vaccines by developing well-
characterised modified allergens using tyrosine as a depot adjuvant. Allergy Therapeutics' short term 
development objective is to create allergy vaccines capable of use as a first line therapy for the 
treatment and cure of allergic diseases including allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis and allergic 
asthma. To achieve this the Group has a pipeline of new vaccines based on the patented innovative adjuvant 
MPL(R) to which the Group has licensed certain exclusive rights.
 With its established business and current infrastructure, the Directors believe that the Group has the 
basis to build a broad-based specialty pharmaceutical business.
 Development pipeline
 Ultra Short Course Subcutaneous Allergy Vaccines
 The Group is developing a range of ultra-short course MPL(R) -based subcutaneous allergy vaccines, 
administered as four injections before the start of the pollen season. The products are for the treatment 
of allergic rhino-conjunctivitis to specific, high-prevalence pollens and house-dust mites. The objective 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0033A
of the products is to relieve the symptoms and reduce the dependence of the patient on symptomatic 
medication such as anti-histamines and steroids.
 The Group is in the advantageous position of having already conducted successful preliminary double-blind 
placebo controlled studies on these vaccines and, as a consequence, having marketed these products under 
the brand name Pollinex(R) Quattro in certain European markets since 1999 as named-patient products. This 
product, based on the MPL(R) adjuvant, achieves significant symptom relief and reduced use of symptomatic 
medication with just four injections, a major improvement on the dosing required by most allergy vaccines. 
With the benefit of these preliminary studies and the wealth of safety and efficacy data generated by the 
clinical use of the products (over 80,000 treatment sets have been sold to date), the directors believe 
that the probability of success with the Phase III registration studies is high.
 Pollinex(R) Quattro was recently awarded the highly prestigious MMW-Arzneimittelpreis in Germany.  The 
purpose of the award is to recognise pharmaceutical "classics of the future" - a development the judges 
believe has advanced an existing therapy considerably and set new standards.  Previous winners have 
included, amongst others, Bayer in 1988, for its development of aspirin as the standard in the prevention 
and treatment of cardiovascular disease, SmithKline Beecham in 1990, for its work with penicillin, 
producing the leading anti-bacterial drug, Amoxycillin, Eli Lilly for insulin in 1990, and Zeneca in 1999 
for Tamoxifen, the top-selling breast cancer drug.
 The Group currently has ultra-short course vaccines for allergy to five key allergens in various stages 
of full scale development for registration: grass, tree, ragweed, housedust mite and Japanese cedar. It is 
estimated that these allergy vaccines cover the needs of approximately three-quarters of allergic rhino-
conjunctivitis sufferers in the main pharmaceutical markets of Europe, the US and Japan.
 Large Phase III pivotal trials for registration of the grass, tree and ragweed products in Europe and the 
US are planned and the directors expect that first registrations will be achieved in early 2008. First 
registrations for the Japanese cedar and housedust mite products are expected to be achieved in 2009.

 --      Under IFRS the results from associates and jointly controlled entities (joint ventures), 
accounted for under the equity method, are required to be presented net of finance costs and tax on the 
face of the income statement.  Under UK GAAP the operating results of BG Group's associates and joint 
ventures were included within total operating profit.  Given the importance of such businesses to the 
Group, information will be included in the income statement to continue to report total operating profit 
including the operating results of these entities.
 --      Items which were classified as exceptional under UK GAAP, in particular profits and losses on the 
disposal of property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets will be separately identified from 
results in respect of business performance.  Management believes that the separate identification of these 
items facilitates understanding of the underlying performance of the business and improves comparability 
of results. These items will be reported in a column separated from business performance in the income 
statement.
 --      Charges and credits recognised in the income statement which arise from the re-measurement of 
derivative instruments, in particular commodity instruments, will be separately identified from business 
performance as they reflect movements in external market prices rather than the underlying performance of 
the business during the period.  These items will be reported in a column separated from business 
performance in the income statement.

 net investment hedges was to pool these at a Group level and consider the
 effectiveness of hedging at a consolidated Group level.  IFRS requires
 each borrowing to be considered separately for hedge effectiveness.
 There is currently a question as to whether hedge effectiveness under
 IAS39 can be established for all our foreign currency borrowings and, if
 not, potentially volatile exchange gains or losses would be reported in
 net finance costs when there are equal and offsetting losses or gains in
 reserves on consolidation and no net impact on Group equity.

 (iv)  Certain existing assets will be derecognised at date of transition
 but these will not be material.
 (v)  Interest accruals will be reclassified from other
 receivables/payables to form part of the carrying value of the related
 financial asset or liability.
 (vi)  The net debt position as reported in the accounts will change with
 the implementation of IAS39.
 With the publication of the first quarter result for 2005, which will
 reflect the application of IAS32 and IAS39, the Group will provide a
 restatement of the opening balances at 1 January 2005 to explain the
 changes as a result of these two standards.

6.   Taxation
 According to the Estonian Income Tax Act the accrued profit of a resident legal entity is not subject to 
corporate income tax, instead the tax is due on the dividend distribution. The tax rate applicable in 2004 
was 26/74 on the dividends paid.
 In case dividends are paid from the retained earnings for the period 1994-1999, it is possible to 
discount the income tax paid earlier on the part of the retained earnings and prepayments of the tax on 
dividends made before 2000 from the amount of income tax to be paid on the respective amount of 
distribution.

 Ryanair operates a low fares scheduled passenger airline serving short-haul,  point-to-point  routes in 
Europe from its bases at Dublin, London (Stansted), Glasgow (Prestwick), Brussels (Charleroi), Frankfurt 
(Hahn), Milan (Bergamo), Stockholm (Skavsta), Rome (Ciampino), Barcelona (Girona), Nottingham East 
Midlands, London (Luton), Liverpool, Shannon, Pisa and Cork airports, which together are referred to as 
"Ryanair's bases of operations" or "Ryanair's bases". An additional base at Marseille, France was 
announced during May 2006 and is expected to commence operations in November 2006. In addition, on 
September 19, 2006, Ryanair announced a new base at Bremen, Germany, expected to commence operations in 
April 2007. In operation since 1985, Ryanair pioneered the low fares operating model in Europe under a new 
management team in the early 1990s.  As of September 15, 2006, the Company offered over 750 scheduled 
short-haul flights per day serving 115 locations throughout Europe, including 24 locations in the United 
Kingdom and Ireland, with an operating fleet of 107 aircraft flying approximately 305 routes.
 Ryanair had a turnover and operating profit before taxation of EUR1,692,530,000 and EUR375,046,000 
respectively for the year ended 31 March, 2006.
 Aggregate expenditure by Ryanair to acquire its approximate 16 per cent. interest in Aer Lingus was over 
EUR204.8m (excluding expenses), all of which was funded from the cash reserves of Ryanair.
 Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley are acting as financial advisers to Ryanair.
 5.      Reasons for the Offer and Ryanair's Strategy for Aer Lingus
 The directors of Ryanair believe that the combination of Aer Lingus and Ryanair will create a highly 
efficient, pro-consumer and, above all, vigorously competitive airline delivering lower fares for 
consumers.
 Aer Lingus's offering on both its short-haul and long-haul routes, including its key strategic slots in 
Heathrow, will complement Ryanair's different type of offering on its rapidly growing trans-European 
network.
 The combined strength of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would establish an Irish airline group with over 50m 
passengers annually, capable of competing on the European and World stage against other large European 
airline groups, including Lufthansa/SAS/Swiss (75m passengers), Air France/KLM (70m passengers) and 
BA/Iberia (63m passengers). As the European airline industry consolidates, this acquisition, if it 
proceeds, will replicate previous consolidations in France (Air France/Brit Air/Regionale/KLM), UK 
(BA/B.Cal/DanAir/City Express), Germany (Lufthansa/Eurowings/Lufthansa Cityline/Swiss) and Scandinavia 
(SAS/Braethens).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -4-
 The board of Ryanair believes that there are benefits of combining these two Irish and European airlines 
into one group, and to give a flavour of what this offer - if successful - might mean to Aer Lingus, its 
stakeholders and the people of Ireland and Europe, Ryanair intends to:-
 --    Reduce Aer Lingus' average short haul fare (EUR87.55 in 2005 (source : IPO Prospectus)) by 2 [1/2]% 
a year for a minimum period of four years;
 --    Reduce Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as the price of oil falls from recent highs;
 --    Retain the Aer Lingus brand;
 --    Retain the Heathrow slots;
 --    Retain all profitable routes currently operated by Aer Lingus;
 --    Reduce Aer Lingus' costs through improved efficiencies and Ryanair's superior purchasing power;
 --    Give Aer Lingus access to the benefit of Ryanair's lower cost aircraft deliveries and lower cost 
financing facilities;
 --    Upgrade Aer Lingus' transatlantic fleet and improve its long haul product;
 --    Maintain Aer Lingus as a stand alone, separate company within one strong Irish airline group under 
common ownership but run as separate competing airlines.
 As the above benefits demonstrate, the board of Ryanair intends to deliver a publicly owned, Irish 
managed and headquartered airline group with the necessary ambition, expertise, financial strength and 
cost base to take on European and global competitors well into the future.  As an island nation, Ireland 
is critically dependent upon strong and secure low fare airline services in order to sustain and develop 
tourism and economic growth. Investing in Aer Lingus is attractive for Ryanair and its shareholders 
because, amongst other things, Aer Lingus' earnings yield is superior to the returns currently available 
on Ryanair's cash deposits. The board of Ryanair believes that there will be opportunities (by combining 
the purchasing power of Ryanair and Aer Lingus) to reduce operating costs, to increase efficiencies and to 
pass on these savings in the form of low fares to the travelling public.
 Ryanair has grown to be Europe's largest low fares airline by continuously lowering prices and funding 
these reductions through cost savings and efficiencies.  The board of Ryanair believes there is an 
opportunity to apply this successful low fares formula to Aer Lingus where currently, in its short haul 
operation, fares and costs remain far too high.  Ryanair would also expect to work closely with Aer 
Lingus, if the offer is successful, to improve its long haul operations where the board of Ryanair 
believes there is room to upgrade the long haul fleet and improve this product which has not kept pace 
with the competition in recent years.  Since the board of Ryanair envisages that the two companies would 
be run separately, in the event that the Offer is successful, nothing in this transaction will deflect 
Ryanair from continuing to focus on its own pan-European expansion or from continuing to deliver unit cost 
reductions and continuing to offer lower fares to millions of Ryanair's European passengers.
 There are numerous precedents across Europe (in the UK, France, Spain, Germany and Scandinavia) for two 
airlines of similar nationality coming together to form a stronger, more widely diversified airline group. 
The European Union has recognised the value of competitive European airline consolidation because of the 
benefits which it brings to consumers.  The board of Ryanair believes this Offer, if successful, will 
result in that precedent being replicated in Ireland, with the added benefit that customers of Aer Lingus 
will enjoy lower fares in the short haul market, a better product and service in the long haul market by 
reducing fuel surcharges as oil prices fall, as Ryanair applies its philosophy of lower costs and lower 
fares to Aer Lingus' existing business.
 6.      Financing
 The Offer will be financed from the cash reserves of Ryanair.
 Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley confirm that they are satisfied that resources are available to 
Ryanair sufficient to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer.
 7.      Employees
 Following the Cash Offer becoming or being declared unconditional in all respects, the existing 
employment rights of the management and employees of the Aer Lingus Group will be safeguarded in 
accordance with statutory requirements.  However, Ryanair would expect to continue the effective 
rationalisation programme followed by Aer Lingus in recent years.
 8.            Ryanair Shareholder approval
 In view of the size of Aer Lingus relative to Ryanair, amongst other conditions to the Cash Offer (as set 
out in Appendix I), the approval of Ryanair shareholders at an EGM is required in accordance with the 
Listing Rules of The Irish Stock Exchange and the UK Listing Authority.  An ordinary resolution of Ryanair 
shareholders will be proposed to approve, implement and effect the Offer by Ryanair and to authorise the 
directors of Ryanair to do all such things as they consider necessary or appropriate in connection with 
the Offer.
 9.         Offer Document
 The Offer Document, containing the full terms and conditions of the Offer, will be posted as soon as 
practicable to Aer Lingus Shareholders.
 10.       Disclosure of Interests in Aer Lingus
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -4-
 As at the close of business on 4 October, 2006, being the latest practicable day prior to the date of 
this announcement, parties acting in concert with Ryanair owned 85,034,469 Aer Lingus Shares representing 
approximately 16 per cent. of the existing issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus. All such Aer 
Lingus Shares are owned by Coinside Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair except for 259,469 Aer 
Lingus Shares which are held by an affiliate of Davy Corporate Finance on its own account and on behalf of 
certain discretionary clients.
 Save for these interests, neither Ryanair, nor the directors of Ryanair, nor any party acting in concert 
with Ryanair, owns or controls any Aer Lingus Shares or holds any options to acquire or subscribe for any 
Aer Lingus Shares or any derivative referenced to Aer Lingus Shares.
 Neither Ryanair nor any persons acting in concert with Ryanair has any arrangement in relation to Aer 
Lingus Shares, or any securities convertible or exchangeable into Aer Lingus Shares or options (including 
traded options) in respect of, or derivatives referenced to, Aer Lingus Shares.  For these purposes, 
'arrangement' includes an indemnity or option arrangement, any agreement or understanding, formal or 
informal, of whatever nature, relating to relevant securities which is, or may be, an inducement to deal 
or refrain from dealing in such securities.
 11.       Regulatory Issues
 Having taken legal advice, the board of Ryanair is confident that any regulatory aspects relating to the 
consummation of the Offer are capable of being successfully dealt with.
 12.       Settlement, Compulsory Acquisition, De-listing and Re-registration
 The consideration will, in relation to Aer Lingus Shareholders who validly accept the Cash Offer up to 
the time the Cash Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects, be despatched not later than 
14 days after the Cash Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects, or thereafter within 14 
days of receipt of acceptance of the Cash Offer.

(1)   The Group operates in certain countries (principally South Africa and Venezuela) where the existence 
of exchange controls may restrict the use of certain cash balances.  These restrictions are not expected 
to have any material effect on the Group's ability to meet its ongoing obligations.
 (2)   Excludes overdrafts, which are included as cash and cash equivalents.  Short term borrowings on the 
balance sheet of $2,076 million (2004: $3,383 million) include $111 million (2004: $174 million) of 
overdrafts.
 (3)   Derivatives of net debt items that have been designated as hedged and are effective are included 
within this table to give a true reflection of the Group's net debt position at period end.  These

 Brambles Industries plc
 Treatment of Prior Year Comparatives
 Brambles will be releasing its interim results for the six months to December 2002 at the start of the 
London trading day on 26 February 2003.  In order to assist understanding of the underlying business 
performance, Brambles press release and presentations to analysts will be made on the basis described 
below and comparative data for the six months to December 2001 should be adjusted.  The changes are in 
presentation only and do not affect the profits of the Group reported last year.
 a)      CHEP - Analysis of Profitability by Geography
 An analysis of CHEP's profit by region will be included.  Schedule 1 attached reflects the following in 
respect of the prior half year:-
 --        Geographic breakdown
 --        An allocation of the ongoing accounting harmonisation
 --        An allocation of the one off element of the accounting harmonisation
 For ongoing measurement, the profit after ongoing harmonisation and described as EBITA on Schedule 1 is 
the appropriate comparison of performance.
 The context for the changes in presentation is that in February 2002, Brambles Industries announced a 
harmonisation of accounting policies within CHEP, affecting pallet depreciation and loss provisioning.  At 
the same time, there was a write-down of pallets in the non-participating distributor (NPD) channel in the 
USA. Full details of these changes can be found in the Annual Review for the year to June 2002, available 
on our website http://www.brambles.com/.  At the time of this announcement, CHEP's EBITA (profit before 
interest, tax and goodwill amortisation) was not split out by geography and the effect of the accounting 
harmonisation on specific regions was not identified.
 Additionally the full year results to 30 June 2002 included the CHEP harmonisation in operating 
activities rather than "operating exceptional items".  The half year results to 31 December 2001 now 
reflect the same treatment.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0070A
 The post on-going harmonisation figures (EBITA in Schedule 1) will be used as prior year comparatives to 
explain trading movements in the press release and analyst presentations when results for the current 
financial year are released.
 b)      Treatment of Businesses Since Divested
 As in previous periods and in line with accounting standards, results for those businesses which have 
since been divested are shown as 'Discontinued'.  Schedule 2 shows the effect of the reallocation on the 
prior year segmental analysis.
 c)      Use of Constant Currency comparators
 The press release and presentations to analysts will measure financial performance in constant currency.  
The basis for the calculation of the constant currency will be the prior year average exchange rates for 
the six months to 31 December 2001, which will be applied to the current year.
 Schedule 3 shows the net effect of all the changes identified on the Combined Profit and Loss Account for 
the six months to December 2001.

Note:  The new loss provisioning policy was introduced with effect from December 2001 and hence the effects for 
the first half were originally included in the 'one-off' charge.  To ensure proper comparison with subsequent year 
figures, a GBP5million loss provisioning charge has been moved from 'one-off' to 'on-going' in the analysis shown 
above i.e. as if the policy had been in effect for the financial year starting on 1 July 2001.  The net effect is 
unchanged.

 We are now half way through a four year turnaround programme under a new management team, designed to 
deliver strong investment performance, positive net new business flows and higher profitability.  Investment 
performance has improved markedly but there is further work to do.  Net business outflows in 2003 were down on 
the previous year, although this was in part due to certain expected client withdrawals being deferred to 2004.  
Meanwhile the cost base has been reduced significantly which has resulted in increased profitability.
 *  See Note at end of section
 The reorganisation of the firm is now complete and the emphasis is on extending the improvement in investment 
performance, developing new products and distribution channels, and growing revenues.  In an increasingly 
competitive environment and with higher levels of client turnover than the industry has seen historically, inflows and 
outflows of business can be sizeable and their timing unpredictable.  Nonetheless, as Schroders celebrates its 
200(th) anniversary year, we expect the improving trend in net business flows and financial performance to 
continue.

Note
 *  During the year  GBP3.5 billion of sub-advisory assets were transferred from Institutional to Retail to reflect more 
closely the underlying source of this business.  In Asia, GBP0.3 billion was transferred from Private Banking to 
Institutional.  Of the GBP2.1 billion adjustment to reflect the sales of Schroder Hermes and Schroder Pensions, 
GBP1.5 billion was classified as institutional assets and GBP0.6 billion as retail assets. These changes have been 
reflected as appropriate throughout this announcement.

 Pre-clinical studies with MPL(R) administered sub-lingually have demonstrated immune system stimulation. The 
directors believe that if similar responses were to be shown in humans, highly efficacious sublingual allergy 
vaccines based on MPL(R) with allergen could be developed. Such sublingual allergy vaccines would be self-
administered in the form of drops placed under the tongue using a pump that meters the dose, as with the currently 
marketed Oralvac(R) plus product. By incorporating MPL(R) , the intention is to improve the efficacy of sublingual 
vaccines and simplify the dosing regimes. The added convenience of safe and easy home administration would 
make the product suitable for prescription by family practitioners.
 Allergy Therapeutics plans to conduct an initial proof of concept study in humans in the immediate future, as soon 
as the requisite toxicology work has been completed. Depending on the outcome of these studies, the Group 
intends to develop sublingual vaccines against allergy to the same range of allergens as Pollinex(R) Quattro (grass, 
tree, ragweed, Japanese cedar and housedust mite). A large scale development plan will be put in place and the 
directors believe that first registrations could be obtained as early as 2009.
 Allergy market
 The incidence of Type 1 Allergy in most developed countries is commonly in the range of 20 to 30 per cent. of the 
total population, of which one third may develop allergic asthma. This incidence has been rising since the early 
1980s at a rate of 3 per cent. per annum. In the US alone, it is estimated that between 40 and 60 million people 
suffer from allergies. It is estimated that more than 30 million people suffer from allergies in Japan and over 50 
million in Europe.
 Current allergy treatment is almost exclusively concerned with the management of allergic symptoms using drugs 
such as anti-histamines and steroids supplemented with, in the case of allergic asthma, drugs to improve breathing 
such as <BETA>-agonists. These medicines are available, as oral or inhaled formulations, by prescription and over-
the-counter ("OTC"). Although these palliative drugs provide temporary symptomatic relief, they can be 
inconvenient to use and can cause unwanted side effects. Most importantly, they need to be administered 
chronically and do not modify the underlying disease state, nor do they prevent the so-called Allergic March from 
seasonal/perennial rhino-conjunctivitis to allergic asthma. Sales of these palliative symptomatic anti-allergy drugs 
exceed US$12 billion.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0033A -2-
 An alternative to this palliative treatment is allergy vaccination (also referred to as specific immunotherapy or de-
sensitisation). Allergy vaccination (both injectable and sublingual) is currently the only treatment for Type 1 Allergy 
hypersensitivity that can alter or cure the underlying disease process.
 Allergy vaccine market
 Conventional immunotherapy is a gradual immunisation process in which increasing individualised concentrations 
of pollen extracts are administered to induce increased tolerance to natural allergen exposure. Practice varies, but 
typically the procedure involves weekly or monthly doses of the offending allergens which, over time, induce 
immunological tolerance. Three years or more of allergy vaccination is required for long term effect of the treatment. 
Because of the number of injections (as many as 180), length of treatment and potential risk of serious side effects, 
a significant portion of patients do not complete the therapy course. As a result, allergy vaccination has less than a 
5 per cent. market share in most markets.
 It is unsurprising that conventional immunotherapy has not captured a significant portion of the growing market for 
the treatment and prevention of allergies because its complexity and risk limits its use to qualified allergists and 
limits its attractiveness to patients. Hence Allergy Therapeutics believes that capturing maximum market share with 
allergy vaccines will come by improving the characteristics of the products. Allergy Therapeutics' short term, well-
tolerated, safe and effective MPL(R) -based vaccines are designed, once registered, to achieve this market 
expansion.

 Information for US Investors
 RECONCILIATION TO UNITED STATES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
 The Group profit and loss account and Group balance sheet set out on pages 9, 10 and 11 are prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP) which differ in certain 
material respects from those generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP).  The differences as they apply to 
AstraZeneca PLC are explained in the Group's 2001 Annual Report and Form 20-F except that, in the current year, 
AstraZeneca adopted SFAS No141 'Business Combinations' and SFAS No142 'Goodwill and Other Intangible 
Assets'.  As a result goodwill is no longer amortised but tested annually for impairment.  The effect has been to 
increase profit by approximately $755m.  The approximate effects on Group income and shareholders' equity of the 
GAAP differences are shown below.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
 1. Significant Accounting Policies
 The preliminary results for the year ended 31 December 2005 and the results for the year ended 31 December 
2004 are prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the EU ('IFRS').  The 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0064A -4-
accounting policies applied in preparing the 2005 preliminary results are in accordance with IFRS and are therefore 
different to those applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004. The Group's 
current accounting policies were included in the 2005 Interim Report as published on 16 September 2005.
 The financial information set out in this preliminary announcement does not constitute the Company's statutory 
accounts for the years ended 31 December 2005 or 31 December 2004.  The financial information for the year 
ended 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 are prepared under IFRS. For the year ended 31 December 
2004 the statutory accounts were originally presented under UK GAAP. The auditors reported on those accounts:  
their report was unqualified and did not contain a statement under either Section 237(2) or Section 237(3) of the 
Companies Act 1985.
 2. Loss per share
 The calculation of basic loss per ordinary share has been based on the loss of GBP4,691,000 (2004: GBP300,000) 
and on 35,079,334 (2004: 38,421,309) ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in 
issue.
 Potential ordinary shares are not treated as dilutive as their conversion to ordinary shares does not increase the 
net loss per share.
 3. Business combinations
 On 7 March 2005, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of CellMed AG, a medical technology company 
developing medical device and drug delivery products in Germany. The acquired business contributed revenues of 
GBP72,000 and net loss of  GBP1,381,000 to the Group for the period from 7 March 2005 to 31 December 2005.

Body
 To manage our underwriting, we assign maximum gross and net line sizes for all underwriters.  This limit 
is adjusted according to the nature of the business being underwritten and the experience of the 
underwriter and cannot be exceeded unless appropriately authorised.  To ensure that our decisions are 
robust, there is a comprehensive sign-off process for underwriting transactions including dual sign-off 
for all line underwriters.
 Reserving activities are rigorously controlled to ensure adequate reserves are set. A quarterly peer 
review process exists for the underwriting teams and group actuary to independently determine required 
movements.
 3    Segmental analysis
 Segment information is presented in respect of business segments (primary) and Lloyd's/non-Lloyd's 
(secondary)
 segments.   This is based on the group's management and internal reporting structures.
 Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those 
that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
 All inter-segment transactions are determined on an arm's length basis.
 a)    Primary reporting segment - business segments
 The group is organised into four business segments: specialty lines, property, reinsurance and marine.  A 
description of the business undertaken by each segment is given in note 2.
 All foreign exchange differences on non-monetary items have been left unallocated.  This has been 
separately disclosed as it provides a fairer representation of the loss ratios, which would otherwise be 
distorted by the mismatch arising under IFRSs whereby unearned premium reserve, reinsurance share of 
unearned premium reserve and DAC are treated as non-monetary items and claims reserves are treated as 
monetary items.

1. Segmental information (continued)
Primary reporting format - by business segment (continued)
(1) Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received
 or receivable for all significant products. Where a by-product
 is not regarded as significant, then revenue may be credited against
 cost of sales. The amount credited to cost of sales for the 12
 months ended 31 December 2005 was $76 million (December 2004:
 $81 million) and related principally to AngloGold Ashanti who
 credit uranium, silver and acid to cost of sales in accordance
 with the Gold Industry Standard on production cost.
 (2) Base Metals' turnover is stated net of treatment and refining
 charges on concentrate sales to external parties and refining
 charges on copper anode sales from Chagres to refineries.
 (3) Segment result is defined as being segment revenue less segment
 expense; that is operating profit and gains and losses from foreign
 currency derivatives that have been recycled in the income statement
 in cash flow hedges of sales and purchases. In addition net income
 from associates is shown by segment. There are no material inter-segment
 transfers or transactions that would affect the segment result.
 Special items are set out in note 4. Associates' operating profit
 is reconciled to 'Net income from associates' as follows:

Notes to the financial statements
1 The interim results have been prepared in accordance with
 applicable Accounting Standards under the historical cost convention
 and are in accordance with the Company's accounting policies
 as set out in the annual report and accounts for the year ended
 31 December 2001. The financial information for the twelve months
 to 31 December 2001 is extracted from the annual report and
 accounts for that period, which contained an unqualified auditor's
 report and which have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.
2 The goodwill amortisation charge relates to the amortisation
 of purchased goodwill arising on the acquisition of Bywater
 Limited in October 2001 over its estimated useful life. The
 directors have reviewed the estimated useful life and now regard
 10 years as a reasonable period.
3 The interim tax charge reflects an estimate of the likely
 effective tax rate for the full year applied to the interim
 profit on ordinary activities.
4 Earnings per share has been calculated in accordance with
 Financial Reporting Standard 14, by dividing the consolidated
 profit after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
 weighted average number of 1p ordinary shares outstanding during
 the period.
Diluted earnings per share has also been calculated on the same
 basis as above except that the weighted average number of ordinary
 shares that would be issued on the conversion of all of the
 dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares has
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0049A -3-
 been added to the denominator. There are no changes to the profit
 (numerator) as a result of the dilutive calculation.

 and the after tax effect of reorganisation costs.

 Summary
 2005 has been an excellent year for Venture, with the Company meeting market expectations.  This has been 
accomplished due to three main factors.  Firstly, increased production volumes have generated stronger cashflows 
and profitability.  Secondly, with strong commodity prices and with a greater proportion of unhedged production, the 
Company has been able to deliver more of the revenues achieved to profit and cashflow.  Finally, lower unit lifting 
costs have generated greater cashflow per unit of production.  All of these factors should continue to drive 
profitability during 2006.

The Group has titles of temporary differences which cause both deferred tax asset (Note 6A - PLN 45,178 
thousand) and provision for deferred tax (Note 21A - PLN 17,172 thousand). In the financial statements each of the 
companies discloses deferred tax after compensation, i.e. net asset or provision. As at 30 June 2004, after 
compensation, in the consolidated balance sheet the Group presented deferred tax asset amounting to PLN 29,479 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0237A -14-
thousand and provision for deferred tax in the amount of PLN 1,473 thousand. The Group does not compensate 
deferred tax assets and provisions for deferred tax relating to different companies.
 Major items of the deferred tax asset relate to the following:
 1) tax loss of Softbank S.A. for year 2002 in the amount of PLN 17,061 thousand - resulting mostly from the 
disposal of TDC Internet Polska S.A., tax loss of Softbank S.A. for year 2003 in the amount of PLN 4,742 thousand 
- resulting mostly from the disposal of FinFin S.A. and tax loss generated at the end of first half of 2004 in the 
amount of PLN 1,607 thousand,
 2) impairment of financial assets of Prokom Software S.A. (deferred tax asset in the amount of PLN 22,205 
thousand).
 At the end of first half of 2004 the Parent Company verified its estimates regarding the future taxable income and 
states that the recoverability of the deferred tax asset recognized by the Group is probable on the basis of the plan 
of the Group entities and current corporate income tax regulations. Additionally, the capitalization of tax losses of 
the group of Softbank S.A. amounting to PLN 14,770 thousand may be justified by the analysis of future taxable 
income, prepared by the Management of Softbank S.A. At the end of first half of 2004 Softbank S.A. verified its 
estimates relating to the possibility of future taxable income and stated that such value is recoverable and therefore 
the Management of Softbank S.A. maintained the estimates close to those of 2003.
 Most of deductible temporary differences are expected to expire in 2004-2011.

 GBPm   GBPm
Basic      16.8p   3.1p
 Diluted    16.7p   3.1p
Basic
 Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit after tax of GBP59.9m (2005: GBP11.1m) by the 
weighted average number of issued shares during the year of 355.8m (2005: 358.8m).  The shares held in the 
Employee Share Options Plan (ESOP) have been excluded from the calculation, until such time as they vest 
unconditionally with the employees.
 Diluted
 Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit after tax of GBP59.9m (2005: GBP11.1m) by the 
adjusted weighted average number of shares of 359.3m (2005: 362.1m). The adjusted weighted average number of 
shares assumes conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being shares from the SAYE, retention and 
deferred share schemes.  The shares held in the ESOP have been excluded from the calculation, until such time as 
they vest unconditionally with the employees.
 11  Dividends per share
 A final dividend of 3.2p (2005: 2.5p) per ordinary share is payable on 10 May 2007 to shareholders registered on 
13 April 2007 in respect of the year ended 31 December 2006.  Together with the interim dividend of 1.6p (2005: 
1.5p) this brings the total to 4.8p (2005: 4.0p).  These financial statements do not provide for the final dividend as a 
liability.

On 22 March 2000, BG announced plans to pursue a demerger which will separate the activities of its two 
principal businesses, Transco and BG International.  It is currently planned to issue detailed 
documentation and to obtain shareholder approval for the demerger at an Extraordinary General Meeting 
(EGM) in October 2000.
 For further information regarding the split of the balance sheet and the results between the two proposed 
new groups, see note 9, page 25.
 i)            BG's 1999 results included a restatement of that year's quarterly figures to reflect the 
implementation of Financial Reporting Standard 15, 'Tangible Fixed Assets'.
 ii)           The 2000 results of Transco include a GBP50 million charge in the second quarter in respect 
of potential liabilities arising under the Network Code and other shipper issues.
 iii)          The 2000 results of BG Storage include an exceptional charge in the second quarter in 
respect of an impairment of assets.
 iv)          The segmental analysis above reflects the impact of BG's 1999 restructuring.  BG's 1999 
results included a restatement of that year's quarterly figures on this basis.
 v)           Within Other activities, GBP56 million in respect of the six months to 30 June 2000 and 
GBP25 million in respect of the three months to 30 June 2000 is attributable to the businesses which it is 
proposed will be demerged later in the year.

Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 19 'Deferred tax' which was issued on 7 December 2000 and is mandatory for 
accounting periods ending on or after 23 January 2002, requires full provision to be made for deferred tax assets 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0030A -3-
and liabilities, subject to certain exceptions. Previously deferred tax was provided for in respect of timing differences 
to the extent that it was probable that a liability would crystalise in the foreseeable future. FRS 19 has been applied 
in preparing these Accounts and comparative figures have been restated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and 
related Notes. The effect on the Group's previously reported net assets is as follows:
31 Dec 2001
 Net assets                                      GBP million

 As restated                                           162.2
The change in accounting policy, has no effect on the prior period results and has no effect on the profit for the year 
ended 31 December 2002.

INDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT TO BRITISH AIRWAYS Plc
Introduction
 We have been instructed by the Company to review the financial information set out
 within the Group Profit and Loss Account, Group Balance Sheet, Group Cash Flow Statement
 Group Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses and Notes to the Accounts
 and we have read the other information contained in the
 interim report and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material
 inconsistencies with the financial information.
Directors' responsibilities
 The interim report, including the financial information contained therein, is the
 responsibility of, and has been approved by the directors. The Listing Rules of
 the Financial Services Authority require that the accounting policies and presentation
 applied to the interim figures should be consistent with those applied in preparing
 the preceding annual accounts except where any changes, and the reasons for them,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0071A -4-
 are disclosed.
Review work performed
 We conducted our review in accordance with guidance contained in Bulletin 1999/4
 issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review
 consists principally of making enquires of Group management and applying analytical
 procedures to the financial information and underlying financial data and based
 thereon, assessing whether the accounting policies and presentation have been
 consistently applied unless otherwise disclosed. A review excludes audit procedures
 such as tests of controls and verification of assets, liabilities and transactions.
 It is substantially less in scope than an audit performed in accordance with United
 Kingdom Auditing Standards and therefore provides a lower level of assurance than
 an audit.
 Accordingly we do not express an audit opinion on the financial information.
Review conclusion
 On the basis of our review we are not aware of any material modifications that
 should be made to the financial information as presented for the three months ended
 June 30, 2003.

 (ii) The fair value of the loans was calculated by discounting future cash flows by the market yield at
 the date of acquisition.
 (iii) The directors believe that the useful economic life of the goodwill arising on the acquisition is 
the current financial year.  GBP188,000 has therefore been written off in these accounts; the balance will 
be written off in the second half of the year.

4.   Special items and remeasurements
 'Special items' are those items of financial performance that the Group believes should be separately 
disclosed on the face of the income statement to assist in the understanding of the underlying financial 
performance achieved by the Group and its businesses.  Such items are material by nature or amount to the 
period's results and require separate disclosure in accordance with IAS 1.86.  Special items that relate 
to the operating performance of the business are classified as special operating items and include 
impairment charges and reversals and other exceptional items including significant legal provisions. Non-
operating special items include profits and losses on disposals of investments and businesses.  The Group 
believes that items which were previously referred to as 'exceptional items' under UK GAAP fall within the 
scope of special items under IFRS.
 Remeasurements comprise other items which the Group believes should be reported separately to aid an 
understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.  This category includes unrealised gains and 
losses on non-hedge derivative instruments that are recorded in the income statement, and foreign exchange 
gains and losses on dollar denominated De Beers' preference shares held by a Rand functional currency 
subsidiary of the Group.  Remeasurements are defined as operating, non-operating or financing according to 
the nature of the underlying expense.

a)           Software costs of GBP25.2m treated as tangible fixed
 assets under UK GAAP have been reclassified as intangible
 fixed assets under IFRS.
 GBP5.1m of revalued leasehold land classified as
 a finance lease under UK GAAP has been reclassified
 as an operating lease under IFRS.
 b)           Amortisation of GBP9.6m charged under UK GAAP for
 the period has been reversed under IFRS, as goodwill
 is not amortised under IFRS but instead is tested
 annually for impairment.
 c)           The revaluation reserve recognised under UK GAAP
 has been reclassified as other reserves under IFRS,
 as the Group has elected, under IFRS 1, to retain
 UK GAAP carrying values of property, plant and equipment
 including revaluations as deemed cost at transition.
 d)           IFRS 2 requires the fair value of option and share
 awards to be charged to the Income Statement over
 the vesting period. The fair value is determined
 at the date of grant using an appropriate pricing
 model. The Group have elected to take the exemption
 under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS 2 to grants of equity
 instruments on or before 7 November 2002 that had
 vested prior to 1 January 2005.
 e)           Pension liabilities increased by GBP0.9m (net of
 deferred tax) under IFRS because the method of valuing
 pension scheme assets differs from UK GAAP.
 Deferred tax assets of GBP25.4m which were netted
 off against the related pension liabilities under
 UK GAAP are now included within the deferred tax
 headings on the face of the balance sheet.
 f)           Adjustments to deferred tax relate to the recognition
 of:
 (i)   A deferred tax asset of GBP0.7m relating to the cost
 of share options granted to employees under IFRS.
 (ii)   A deferred tax liability of GBP2.0m in respect of
 certain revalued land under IFRS.
 (iii)   A deferred tax asset of GBP1.4m in respect of certain
 qualifying revalued buildings under IFRS.
 (iv)    A deferred tax asset of GBP0.2m relating to the cost
 of holiday pay accrued under IFRS.
 (v)     A deferred tax liability of GBP0.3m under IFRS, relating
 to goodwill amortised on assets acquired post April
 2002, which is deductible for taxation purposes.
 (vi)    The reclassification of the deferred tax asset of
 GBP25.4m relating to the pension liability which
 is netted against the pension liability under UK
 GAAP, and the reclassification of the resulting deferred
 tax asset to non-pension items.
 g)           Under IFRS, a liability is recognised for wages and
 salaries costs accrued in respect of untaken holiday
 at the balance sheet date.
 h)           The adjustments to retained earnings are as follows:

 f)                                         Under UK GAAP, dividends are
 recognised as an expense in
 the period to which they relate.
 Under IFRS, dividends are
 recognised as an appropriation

 Therefore the final proposed

 -----------------------------------------------------          ------
(i)     Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over its useful economic
 life, not exceeding 20 years. Under IFRS, goodwill is not
 amortised but tested annually for impairment.
 (ii)    Under IFRS, a liability is recognised for wages and salaries
 costs accrued in respect of untaken holiday at the balance
 sheet date.
 (iii)   IFRS 2 requires the fair value of option and share awards
 to be charged to the Income Statement over the vesting period.
 The fair value is determined at the date of grant using
 an appropriate pricing model. The Group have elected to
 take the exemption under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS 2 to grants
 of equity instruments on or before 7 November 2002 that
 had vested prior to 1 January 2005.
 (iv)    Under IFRS certain leasehold land is reclassified as being
 held under an operating lease rather than a finance lease.
 The associated lease premium is reclassified as a prepayment
 and is released to the Income Statement over the term of
 the associated lease.
 (v)     Under IFRS, the expected return on pension scheme assets
 net of interest cost on the benefit obligation is reclassified
 as an administrative expense.
b)   The expected return on pension scheme assets is lower
 under IFRS than UK GAAP, because the method of valuing
 pension scheme assets differs from UK GAAP. The resulting
 expected return on pension scheme assets net of interest
 cost on the benefit obligation is a net cost of GBP1.2m
 which is reclassified as an administrative expense
 under IFRS. In the opinion of the Directors this
 net cost should be classified in the same profit
 and loss heading as the other pension expenses.
c)
(i)    A deferred tax charge of GBP320,000 is recognised under
 IFRS in relation to taxation on the amortisation of intangibles
 purchased post April 2002, which continues to be deductible
 for tax purposes but is not amortised for accounting purposes
 under IFRS.
 (ii)    Under IFRS, the deferred tax charge in relation to the expected
 return on pension scheme assets is GBP30,000 lower compared
 to UK GAAP.
 (iii)   Deferred income tax is recognised under IFRS in relation
 to certain revalued land (GBP14,000), share options granted
 to employees (GBP23,000) and holiday pay accrued for untaken
 holiday (GBP196,000).
Explanation of material adjustments to the consolidated statement of cash flows
 There are no material differences between the statement of cash flows prepared under IFRS and the cash flow 
statement prepared under UK GAAP.

Operating special charges of $186 million (2004: gain of $25 million) relates principally to impairment 
and closure costs.  Following difficult market conditions, Paper and Packaging have recorded impairment 
and restructuring costs of $77 million in relation to the Corrugated division.  A review of the expected 
life of mine at AngloGold Ashanti's Bibiani operation has led to a $38 million special charge to operating 
profit. One-off costs and charges of $31 million were incurred following the decision to close AngloGold 
Ashanti's Ergo operation.
 Unrealised losses of $301 million on non-hedge derivatives (2004: nil) have been included in operating 
remeasurements. These unrealised losses were recorded principally at AngloGold Ashanti.
 Associates' operating special items and remeasurements includes $113 million for share of De Beers' legal 
settlement.
 Financing remeasurements
 AngloGold Ashanti records the option element of its convertible bond at fair value in the income 
statement following the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39. As a result, a charge of $32 million (2004: nil) 
has been included in financing remeasurements.
 The Group holds US dollar preference shares issued by De Beers which are held in a Rand functional 
currency subsidiary of the Group. As a result of the adoption of IAS 21 and 28, these shares have been 
reclassified as 'non-current investments' and are retranslated at each period end. As a result, a gain of 
$72 million (2004: loss of $112 million) has been included in financing remeasurements.
 Profits and losses on disposals
 Anglo Platinum has entered into the Marikana Pooling and Sharing agreement with Aquarius Platinum to 
jointly mine contiguous properties.  A gain of $27 million arose on transfer of assets to the joint 
venture.
 The sale of Boart Longyear's subsidiary Wendt was concluded in March 2005 for proceeds of $62 million, 
realising a profit on sale of $21 million.  In July 2005 the remainder of the Boart Longyear Group was 
sold for $383 million, with a profit on sale of $21 million.  In the first half of the year, proceeds of 
$116 million were received on the sale of Acerinox leading to a profit on disposal of $25 million.
 Under the terms of an agreement between Kumba Resources Ltd ('Kumba') and Hancock Prospecting Pty Limited 
('Hancock'), Hancock purchased Kumba's interest in the Hope Downs project on 1 July 2005. The proceeds of 
$176 million led to a loss on sale of $57 million for the Group owing to value assigned to the Hope Downs 
project on the acquisition of Kumba by the Group in 2003.
 5.    Net finance costs
 Finance costs and foreign exchange gains/(losses) are presented net of effective cash flow hedges for 
respective interest bearing and foreign currency borrowings.  Fair value gains/(losses) on derivatives, 
presented below, include the mark-to- market value changes of interest rate and currency derivatives 
designated as fair value hedges, net of fair value changes in the associated hedged risk; and fair value 
changes of non-hedge derivatives of non-operating items, including the mark-to-market of the conversion 
option within the AngloGold Ashanti convertible bond.

Reed Elsevier businesses focus on adjusted operating cash flow as a key cash flow measure. Adjusted operating 
cash flow is measured after dividends from joint ventures, tangible fixed asset spend and proceeds from the sale of 
tangible fixed assets but before exceptional payments and proceeds. Adjusted operating cash flow conversion 
expresses adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of adjusted operating profit.

1         Basis of preparation
 The Reed Elsevier combined financial information encompasses the businesses of Reed Elsevier Group plc 
and Elsevier Reed Finance BV and their respective subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, together 
with the parent companies, Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV. The combined financial information has 
been abridged from the audited combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2003. 
Financial information is presented in both sterling and euros.
 The combined financial information has been prepared on the basis of accounting policies in accordance 
with applicable UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  Following changes to Dutch GAAP 
effective for the 2003 financial year in respect of the presentation of dividends and pension accounting, 
UK and Dutch GAAP have diverged such that the Reed Elsevier accounting policies, which previously have 
been in accordance with both UK and Dutch GAAP, no longer accord with Dutch GAAP.  Under Article 362.1 of 
Book 2 Title 9 of the Dutch Civil Code, UK GAAP may be adopted by Dutch companies with international 
operations for the preparation of financial statements and, accordingly, UK GAAP has been so adopted 
ensuring consistency with the prior year of the accounting policies applied in the combined financial 
information.

The information in this announcement, which was approved by the Board of Directors on 4th August 2004, does not 
comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 240 of the Companies Act 1985 (the "Act").  Statutory 
accounts for the year ended 31st December 2003, including the Group's Annual Report on Form 20-F to the US 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0056A
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and which contained an unqualified audit report under Section 235 of 
the Act and did not make any statements under Section 237 of the Act, have been delivered to the Registrar of 
Companies in accordance with Section 242 of the Act.
 This document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect 
to certain of the Group's plans and its current goals and expectations relating to its future financial condition and 
performance.  These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to 
historical or current facts.  Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as "anticipate", "target", 
"expect", "estimate", "intend", "plan", "goal", "believe", or other words of similar meaning.  By their nature, forward-
looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances, including, 
but not limited to, UK domestic and global economic and business conditions, market related risks such as changes 
in interest rates and exchange rates, the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory authorities, changes 
in legislation, the outcome of pending and future litigation and the impact of competition, a number of which are 
beyond the Group's control.  As a result, the Group's actual future results may differ materially from the plans, 
goals, and expectations set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements.  Any forward-looking statements made 
by or on behalf of Barclays speak only as of the date they are made.  Barclays does not undertake to update 
forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in Barclays expectations with regard thereto or any changes in 
events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.  The reader should, however, consult 
any additional disclosures that Barclays has made or may make in documents it has filed or may file with the SEC 
including its most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F.
 Comparative figures have been restated for the changes in accounting policy and presentation detailed on page 
49.
 In this document the profit and loss analysis compares, unless stated otherwise, the half-year to 30th June 2004 to 
the corresponding period of 2003. Balance sheet comparisons, unless stated otherwise, relate to the corresponding 
position at 31st December 2003. Average balance sheet comparisons relate the half-year to 30th June 2004 to the 
corresponding period of 2003.

 BARCLAYS PLC - SUMMARY
 "Barclays had a record half year with all businesses delivering higher profits. Good progress in our core 
UK businesses and excellent performances in our global product businesses demonstrate the benefits of our 
distinctive portfolio."
 Matthew W. Barrett, Group Chief Executive
 Performance Summary
 --      Group performance was very strong:
 -      profit before tax up 23% to GBP2,411m
 -      earnings per share up 25% at 26.7p
 -      dividend per share up 17% to 8.25p
 -      return on equity of 20.4%
 --      All businesses had higher profits, demonstrating good progress across the whole portfolio.
 --      Income growth was particularly strong, up 14%, with good broad based contributions by business 
and by income type.
 --      Expenses increased broadly in line with income growth with the majority of the increase 
attributable to increased variable performance based compensation costs and to higher levels of investment 
spend.
 --      Provisions fell 10% to GBP589m reflecting a decline in non-performing loans and potential problem 
loans.
 --      Delinquency and arrears experience in the UK retail businesses remained stable.
 --      The core UK businesses performed well with good profit generation despite absorbing considerable 
investment in infrastructure and in additional customer facing staff.
 --      The global product businesses performed very strongly demonstrating the success of prior period 
investments.
 --      The integrations of the acquisitions of Charles Schwab Europe, and Clydesdale Financial Services, 
made during 2003, have been completed. The integrations of Banco Zaragozano and Gerrard are progressing 
well and are ahead of schedule.
 --      Balance sheet growth reflects higher levels of customer activity across the Group.
 --      Group net interest margin of 2.56% was almost identical to the margin of 2.57% in the second half 
of 2003 and 10 basis points lower than the first half of 2003.
 --      The Group's capital position remained healthy. Almost GBP1.5bn was returned to shareholders 
through the final dividend for 2003 and share buybacks of GBP600m.
 --      The Group continues to be well positioned for growth across its portfolio of businesses.

1  Growth rates are calculated based on constant rates of exchange.
 2  Euro funds are savings that receive an annual bonus declaration,
 based on the investment performance of the underlying funds.
Principal economic assumptions - deterministic calculations
 Economic assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of 
each reporting period. The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free 
yields to obtain investment return assumptions for ordinary shares and property and to produce risk discount rates. 
Expense inflation is derived as a fixed margin above a local measure of long-term price inflation. Risk-free rates and 
price inflation have been harmonised across territories within the Euro currency zone, except for expense inflation 
in Ireland where significant differences remain. Required capital is shown as a multiple of the EU statutory minimum 
solvency margin.
 Investment return assumptions are generally derived by major product class, based on hypothecating the assets at 
the valuation date. Assumptions about future investment mix are consistent with long-term plans. In most cases, the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0047A -9-
investment mix is assumed to continue unchanged throughout the projection period. The changes in assumptions 
between reporting dates reflect the actual movements in risk-free yields in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone and 
other territories. The principal economic assumptions used are as follows:

For service companies, expense inflation relates to the underlying expenses rather than the fees charged to the life 
company. Future returns on corporate fixed interest investments are calculated from prospective yields less an 
adjustment for credit risk. Required capital in the United Kingdom is 150% EU minimum for Norwich Union Annuity 
Limited and 100% for other companies. Required capital in Spain is 125% EU minimum for Aviva Vida y Pensiones 
and 110% for bancassurance companies.

retention plan.  These shares are purchased on the market and carried at cost.
 On the third anniversary of an award the shares under the deferred share plan are transferred from the trust to the 
employees. Under the retention plan, on the third anniversary, and each year after that, 15.0% of the shares 
awarded are transferred to the employees.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0014A -19-
 The deferred share plan is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over a period of three years, 
while the retention share plan is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over a period of six 
years.

8. Borrowings
 On 12 December 2003, the Group renewed its multi-currency revolving credit facility with Bank of Scotland. The 
new facility is GBP10 million and is committed for three years at an interest rate of 1.5% above LIBOR and is 
provided for the purpose of financing acquisitions. At 31 December 2004, GBP8.1 million (2003: GBP8.4 million) 
had been drawn down under this facility. In addition to this, the Group has a GBP10 million (2003: GBP10 million) 
working capital facility which is repayable on demand. Both facilities are secured on the assets of the Group.
 9. Own shares
 Own shares includes 656,251 (2003 - 774,851) shares in the Group's employee share ownership plan (ESOP).  
These shares are carried at the lower of cost and market value.
 The treatment of ESOP shares has changed following the adoption of Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) Abstract 
38 Accounting for ESOP trusts.  However, the carrying value was less than GBP100,000 at 31 December 2003, 
therefore the adjustment does not result in a change to shareholders' funds in the current or prior year.
 Own shares also includes 888,750 (2003 - nil) treasury shares (refer to note 11 below).

It is expected that the consideration due on the remaining 75% of MPI-XP Power AG will be paid in December 
2005. The final consideration is based on the earnings of MPI-XP Power AG and is estimated to be in the region of 
5.5 million Swiss Francs (GBP2.5 million). The liability for this is included within creditors.
 The Group has options to acquire the remaining 60% of the shares of Powersolve Electronics Limited between 
2007 and 2012. The current best estimate of the consideration payable is GBP6 million. A loan of GBP0.5 million 
has been made to the majority shareholder during the year which is repayable in full in 2007 on the exercise date of 
the first option.

Impairment tests
 Goodwill, syndicate capacity and licences are deemed to have indefinite life.  Consequently, they are not amortised 
but annually tested for impairment.  They are allocated to the group's cash generating units (CGUs) as follows:

When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use.  Value 
in use is calculated using projected cash flows based on financial budgets approved by management covering 
a three-year period.  Cash flows beyond a three-year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth 
rate of 2% (2005: 2%).   This growth rate is consistent with the long-term average growth rate for the 
industry.  A pre-tax discount rate of 8% (2005: 8%) has been used to discount the projected cash flows.

Review to Improve Shareholder Returns
 The Company's investment strategy is to provide net income for distribution from the spread between the interest 
income earned from a portfolio of residential mortgage-backed securities and the cost to finance their acquisition.
 In addition to overseeing the Company's investment activities, the Board of Directors is currently reviewing 
additional options to further enhance Shareholder Returns, which includes but is not limited to, the purchase of 
Company shares.  The Company currently has authority to undertake a share purchase of up to 14.99% of the 
share capital of the Company and the Board of Directors has approved the use of on-market purchases of ordinary 
shares for cancellation at appropriate prices which will enhance Net Asset Value.
 Outlook
 "We believe that the true performance of Prodesse's investment strategy will be recognized by the Company's 
investors from the dividend yield they receive over the long term," said Wellington Denahan-Norris, chief investment 
officer for Prodesse's Investment Manager, FIDAC.
 "We continue to employ all of the portfolio management tools available to us in order to maximize long-term 
financial performance and deliver shareholder value.  In this phase of the interest rate cycle, our investment team is 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0040A -2-
working to position the Company's portfolio for not only current market conditions, but for expected market 
conditions as well."

8. Borrowings
 On 12 December 2003, the Group renewed its multi-currency revolving credit facility with Bank of Scotland. The 
new facility is GBP10 million and is committed for three years at an interest rate of 1.5% above LIBOR and is 
provided for the purpose of financing acquisitions. At 31 December 2004, GBP8.1 million (2003: GBP8.4 million) 
had been drawn down under this facility. In addition to this, the Group has a GBP10 million (2003: GBP10 million) 
working capital facility which is repayable on demand. Both facilities are secured on the assets of the Group.
 9. Own shares
 Own shares includes 656,251 (2003 - 774,851) shares in the Group's employee share ownership plan (ESOP).  
These shares are carried at the lower of cost and market value.
 The treatment of ESOP shares has changed following the adoption of Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) Abstract 
38 Accounting for ESOP trusts.  However, the carrying value was less than GBP100,000 at 31 December 2003, 
therefore the adjustment does not result in a change to shareholders' funds in the current or prior year.
 Own shares also includes 888,750 (2003 - nil) treasury shares (refer to note 11 below).

It is expected that the consideration due on the remaining 75% of MPI-XP Power AG will be paid in December 
2005. The final consideration is based on the earnings of MPI-XP Power AG and is estimated to be in the region of 
5.5 million Swiss Francs (GBP2.5 million). The liability for this is included within creditors.
 The Group has options to acquire the remaining 60% of the shares of Powersolve Electronics Limited between 
2007 and 2012. The current best estimate of the consideration payable is GBP6 million. A loan of GBP0.5 million 
has been made to the majority shareholder during the year which is repayable in full in 2007 on the exercise date of 
the first option.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
 1.     Basis of preparation The results for the 3 months to 31 December 2003 have been prepared on an 
accounting basis consistent with that applied in the financial year to 30 September 2003, except for 
changes arising from the adoption of UITF 38 (Accounting for ESOP trusts). This new pronouncement changes 
the treatment of own shares held in an ESOP trust from being a fixed asset investment to a reduction in 
shareholders' funds.  Consideration paid for the purchase of own shares represents the cost of shares 
purchased by the company.  Consideration received for the sale of own shares represents the prices paid by 
employees on the exercise of options.  The credit in respect of employee share schemes represents the 
charge for those schemes under UITF17 (Employee Share Schemes). Comparative figures have been restated 
accordingly. Financial information for the year to 30 September 2003 has been based on the full Group 
accounts for that period.  The 2003 accounts received an unqualified audit report and have been delivered 
to the Registrar of Companies.  The results for the 3 months to 31 December 2003 are unaudited.

respect of land and building under operating leases:

58,896  263,195
25           CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
 At 31 December 2005, the Group had capital commitments contracted for as follows:
 -       in respect of the acquisition of a gantry from an non-related supplier in the sum of RMB 
4,700,000 intended for use by a subsidiary company, Keen Chance Terminal (GZ) Company Limited.
 -       in respect of the acquisition of eight vessels amounting to US$Nil (2004: US$49,320,000).
 -       in respect of the acquisition of plant, machinery and equipment amounting to US$Nil, primarily 
mining equipment intended for use by a subsidiary, Fujian Sanko Mining Limited (2004: US$40,399,000)
 The Company had no capital commitments.
 26           CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
 (a) On 23 July 1998, a subsidiary of the Company, Keen Chance Terminal (GZ) Company Limited ("KCT"), gave 
a guarantee for RMB50 million (equivalent to approximately US$5.9 million) in favour of the Huangpu Branch 
of the Industry and Commercial Bank of China for banking facilities granted to Harbour Economic 
Development Company Limited ("HEDCL"), a fellow investor in KCT and its ultimate controlling party, 
Guangzhou Huangpu Foreign Trade Group Company Limited and secured over their equity interests in KCT.  
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0012A -7-
HEDCL was unable to repay the loans due to the bank. The bank took action against KCT to enforce the 
guarantee for the outstanding loan.
 (b) On 9 November 1999, KCT gave a guarantee for RMB18 million (equivalent to approximately US$2.1 
million) in favour of Nangang Rural Credit Co-operation Bank for banking facilities granted to Miaotou 
Economic Development Company Limited ("MEDCL"), a fellow investor in KCT, secured over its equity 
interests in KCT. MEDCL was unable to repay the outstanding loan.
 26           CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)
 On 27 September 2001, the Guangzhou Law Court delivered an order and notice that the guarantees above 
were invalid and MEDCL's equity interest in KCT was frozen.
 Based on legal advice, the equity interests had no material impact on the operations of KCT and the 
directors consider that no provision is required.
 KCT maintains that the guarantee given was invalid on the following grounds:
 (1)          such guarantee did not have approval from the board of directors of KCT;
 (2)  in accordance with the law of the People's Republic of China, the board of directors and the 
management of KCT cannot give KCT's properties for guarantee to its shareholder; and
 (3)  the controlling party of HEDCL has not held a valid business licence since 1998 and ceased 
operations in 1999. In accordance with the banking regulations of the People's Republic of China, the bank 
cannot lend money to enterprises which do not have a valid business licence.
 The legal proceedings are still in progress.  Based on legal advice, the directors are of the opinion 
that, the loan agreement was void because it was illegal and accordingly, the guarantee contract was also 
invalid.
 Furthermore, Keen Lloyd Holdings Limited, the Company's parent company, has indemnified the Group against 
any loss KCT will suffer should the guarantee be enforceable.
 Accordingly, the directors are of the opinion that no provision should be made in the financial 
statements for any possible claim from the bank in respect of the litigation.
 27           ULTIMATE CONTROLLING PARTY
 The directors consider that Chin Dynasty Foundation Limited ("CDFL"), a company incorporated in the 
British Virgin Islands is the ultimate holding company.  CDFL is controlled by the Chin Dynasty Fund.
 The Chin Dynasty Fund is a discretionary trust where Mr Qin Shun Chao is the settlor.  Members of Mr 
Qin's family are the potential beneficiaries of the trust.
 No group financial statements for CDFL are published.
 The company's immediate parent company is Keen Lloyd Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in the 
British Virgin Islands.

 BANQUE INTERNATIONALE ARABE DE TUNISIE
 REPORT OF THE AUDITORS
 INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 AS AT JUNE 30, 2003
 Pursuant to the provisions of article 21 of law 94-117 dated November 14, 1994 relating to the reorganization of 
financial market, we have conducted a limited audit review of the interim financial statements of BANQUE 
INTERNATIONALE ARABE DE TUNISIE <<B.I.A.T>> for the period starting from January 1st, 2003 to June 30, 
2003, showing net total assets of TND 2,877,971 thousand and a net profit of TND 14,039 thousand.
 These provisional financial statements are the responsibility of the Bank's management. Our responsibility is to 
issue a report on these financial statements based on our limited audit review.
 Our limited audit review was conducted in accordance with the generally accepted auditing standards in Tunisia 
applicable to review engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform the limited audit review to 
obtain moderate assurance as to whether the interim financial statements are free from material misstatements.
 A limited audit review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank's personnel and analytical procedures applied to 
financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit.
 We have not performed an audit, and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
 Based on our limited audit review, nothing has come to our attention that caused us to believe that the attached 
financial statements do not give a true and fair view of the financial position of BANQUE INTERNATIONALE 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0054A

1  Present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) is the present value
 of new regular premiums plus 100% of single premiums, calculated
 using assumptions consistent with those used to determine new business
 contribution.
 2  New business contribution is after the effect of required capital.
 The effect of required capital represents the impact of holding
 the required capital (expressed as a % of minimum European Union
 (EU) solvency margin or equivalent for non-EU operations) and discounting
 to present value the projected future releases from the required
 capital to shareholders.
 3  New business contribution after the effect of required capital
 includes minority interests in 2006 of GBP39 million (three months
 to 31 March 2005: GBP27 million). This comprises minority interests
 in France of GBP4 million (three months to 31 March 2005: GBP3
 million), Italy GBP9 million (three months to 31 March 2005: GBP6
 million), Spain GBP22 million (three months to 31 March 2005: GBP16
 million), Poland GBP1 million (three months to 31 March 2005: GBP1

 principal accounting policies as set out on pages 35 to 40 of the
 Group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 January
 2006, which have been consistently applied in the six months ended
 31 July 2006.
The figures for the six months to 31 July 2006 and 31 July 2005 are
 unaudited and do not constitute statutory accounts. However, the
 auditors have carried out a review of the figures to 31 July 2006
 and their report is set out in the Independent review report.
A copy of the statutory accounts for the year ended 31 January 2006,
 prepared in accordance with IFRS as detailed in the preceding annualaccounts,
 has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and contained an
 unqualified auditors' report in accordance with section 235 of the
 Companies Act 1985.
The Group has chosen not to adopt IAS 34 'Interim Financial Statements',
 in preparing its interim statements for the six months ended 31 July
 2006 and therefore, this interim statement is not in compliance with
 international financial reporting standards.
(2) Balance Sheet as at 31
 January 2006
 The Group Balance Sheet as at 31 January 2006, as previously published,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0018A -4-
 reported deferred taxation assets of GBP8.5m under non-current assets
 and GBP2.1m under current assets. In order to comply with latest
 accounting standards, the deferred taxation asset under current assets
 has been reclassified under non-current assets. Therefore, the comparative
 balance sheet, as at 31 January 2006, now reports a non-current deferred
 taxation asset of GBP10.6m.
(3) Going Concern Basis
The Group's accounts have been prepared on the basis that the Group
 is a going concern. After making enquiries, the directors have a
 reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue
 in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason,
 they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
 statements.

 PRESS RELEASE
 January 27, 2005
 AXA CONSOLIDATED full year 2004 REVENUES UP 1%
 (2% ON A COMPARABLE BASIS) TO Euro 72.2 BILLION
 STRONG RECOVERY IN LIFE & SAVINGS REVENUES in 4Q04
 --   Life & Savings revenues increased approximately 6% in 4Q04, leading to a 1% growth in full year 2004 
to Euro 47.1 billion, with full year 2004 unit-linked sales up 14%. The full year revenue growth was 
mainly supported by continued strong premium increase in France (+9%) and, as anticipated, a US recovery 
in 4Q04, with US 4Q04 revenues up 6% compared to 4Q03 and to 3Q04.
 --   Property & Casualty revenues increased by 3% to Euro 17.9 billion, with Personal and Commercial 
lines growing 4% and 6%, respectively, as the Group continued to attract new clients and favorable pricing 
persisted in most business lines. This was partly offset by further restructuring in Other lines.
 --   Asset Management revenues increased by 14% to Euro 3.1 billion, benefiting from higher average 
Assets Under Management (AUM) (+16% versus full year 2003), the result of very strong 2004 net inflows 
(Euro 35 billion) and market appreciation.
 --   International Insurance revenues were Euro 3.4 billion, declining by 6% as AXA RE reduced its 
revenues by 15%, in line with its strategic repositioning implemented in 2002.
 Numbers herein have not been audited or adjusted for scope and currency changes.  Growth rates are on a 
comparable basis and, accordingly, have been adjusted for changes in scope, accounting methods and 
currency.
 PARIS-AXA reported today consolidated revenues of Euro 72.2 billion for full year 2004. On a comparable 
basis, revenues grew by 2% compared to full year 2003.
 On a reported basis, total revenues were up 1% from full year 2003 (Euro 71.6 billion), mainly driven by 
organic growth (revenues on a comparable basis up Euro 1.3 billion, or +2%) and MONY's 2H04 revenues (Euro 
1.0 billion impact, or +1%), partly offset by the strength of the Euro versus other currencies (Euro -1.6 
billion impact, or -2%).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0048A
 "As expected, our competitive product offering and the expansion of the distribution platform have 
contributed to our growth momentum in the fourth quarter of 2004," said AXA Chief Executive Officer Henri 
de Castries.
 "Our P&C and Asset Management revenues growth are in line with our long term targets, and we are 
particularly pleased with the strong Asset Management net inflows.
 "Total revenues in our Life & Savings activities have returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2004, 
owing to continued strong performance in France, Southern Europe and Japan, as well as to an anticipated 
recovery in the United States and the United Kingdom. In addition, business mix continues to significantly 
improve as reflected by the increased percentage of unit-linked sales in our total revenues.
 "The benefits of higher revenues within the context of improved margins will become more apparent with 
the disclosure of our 2004 new business contribution growth for Life & Savings operations which, we 
anticipate, should be higher than the half year 2004 increase."

LIFE & SAVINGS: 65% of consolidated revenues
 Life & Savings revenues increased approximately 6% in 4Q04, leading to a 1% growth in full year 2004 to Euro 
47,063 million. This full year performance was mainly supported by continued strong revenue increase in France 
(+9%) stemming from a 58% surge in individual unit-linked premiums. Revenues also benefited from a US recovery 
in 4Q04, with US 4Q04 revenues up 6% compared to 4Q03 and to 3Q04.
 Full year 2004 unit-linked revenues increased by 14% to represent 35% of total Life & Savings revenues, mainly 
driven by the US, France and the UK.

(a) 2H04 revenues include Euro 980 million from MONY, which AXA Financial acquired on July 8, 2004.
 (b) Effective January 1, 2004, the minority interests of Assurances La Poste have been bought out. Belgium full 
year 2003 Life & Savings revenues would have been Euro 82 million higher if the minority buyout had been 
effective as of January 1, 2003.
 France: Revenues increased by 9% and APE was up 14%, mainly resulting from a surge in Individual unit-linked 
premiums and in Health. The individual savings segment recorded a 58% growth in unit-linked premiums, 
compared with a 34% increase for the overall market , due to a strong focus on these products in all sales 
networks, while general account premiums increased slightly (+1%). Unit-linked premiums represented 21% of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0048A
individual savings premiums versus 14% last year. Sales in the new French retirement PERP product experienced 
a promising start in 2004 as 140,000 accounts were opened, with AXA being one of the market's top three 
players(2) .
 Group retirement premiums were up 13% due to new business with major companies and renewals of contracts, 
reflecting AXA's favorable competitive position in both unit-linked and non unit-linked markets.
 Life and Health premiums grew by 8%, reflecting a 15% growth in Health premiums, due to an increasing number 
of contracts in individual Health as well as rate increases, and a 4% growth in Life premiums.
 United States: Excluding the contribution of MONY, revenues for the fourth quarter of 2004 increased by 6%, 
reflecting a 13% growth in Variable Annuity ("VA") sales and a 28% growth in first year life sales partially offset by 
lower fixed annuity sales (-22%) and renewal life premiums (-2%).
 Full year 2004 revenues were down 5% and APE was down 2%, as increases in First Year Life premiums (+25%) 
and Institutional Separate Account premiums (+65%) were more than offset by a 10% decrease in VA premiums 
from a very high 2003 level . Compared to 2002, 2004 VA sales increased by 19% on a CAGR basis.
 MONY's 4Q04 revenues were up 20% compared to 3Q04, and included 14% from sales of AXA-Equitable 
products, up from 8% in 3Q04.
 United Kingdom: Total revenues increased by a strong 16% in 4Q04, leading to revenues up 6% and APE up 3% 
in full year 2004. This was driven by continued growth in sales of single premium unit-linked bonds (up 12%) and 
strong sales of Group Pension regular premium business (up 32%), partly offset by decreased Individual pension 
business (down 20%) reflecting the impact of actions taken in 2003 to improve profitability.
 Since the beginning of 4Q04, significant distribution agreements have been reached with Britannia Building 
Society, Millfield Group and THINC Destini, as well as further agreements for the distribution of the new Protection 
offer with Bankhall, Tenet Group and Sesame.
 Japan: Revenues decreased by 7%, but were up 8% excluding the impact of group pension transfers (Euro 217 
million versus Euro 882 million last year) and conversions (Euro 695 million versus Euro 822 million last year). This 
8% increase was driven by the 25% growth in Investment & Savings premiums, reflecting strong individual annuity 
sales in the bancassurance channel which benefited from new partnerships signed since August 2003, and by the 
16% growth of Health premiums fuelled by continuing focus of the salesforce on strong margin Key6 products such 
as Medical Whole Life and Medical Riders.
 In November 2004, AXA Japan signed a partnership agreement with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi for the distribution 
of AXA Japan's newly launched US dollar-denominated individual annuity certain product.
 Germany: Revenues increased by 2%, driven by unit-linked Investment & Savings premiums, which nearly doubled 
compared to last year, fuelled by strong new business from the "Pensionskasse" (group pension fund product). 
Health revenues increased by 14% due to higher regular premiums, following significant new business inflows in 
2003 and legal premium rate adjustments.
 Life revenues, which represented half of Germany's revenues, were flat.

 17.       Bonds loan
 The Extraordinary General Assembly Meeting held on 11 November 1999 decided to issue convertible bonds 
with a maturity period of four years, and having second priority for repayment after the medium and long 
term loans, which can be traded or transferred into stocks amounting to USD 86.017 million of which USD 
27.017 million were underwritten in a public offering.  These bonds were issued at a face value of USD 
1,000 each, and issued at a discount of 9.025%, in addition to bond issuance cost of  USD 0.25 per bond, 
at an annual variable interest rate of 2.9% over libor of US dollars (for three months) to be paid every 
three months.
 On 1 June 2003 the bondholder's assembly resolved the following:-
 1-   The early retirement of bonds amounting to USD 40 million at the due date of coupon no. (15) On 12 
October 2003.
 2-   The maturity date of the remaining bonds amounting to USD 34.136 million - after the early 
retirement - is 31 December 2006.
 3-   The rest of the bonds issuance conditions remain without amendment.
 According to the board of directors resolution dated 16 February 2006 it was decided to convert a number 
of 29 009 bonds from the issued bonds into 7 542 340 shares (note no. 21-2 issued and paid in capital).
 Accordingly, the number of the outstanding bonds as of 30 September 2006 is 5 043 bond with a total mount

 previously recognised in equity, are included in the initial
 carrying value of the asset.  Where the underlying transaction does
 not result in such an asset, the accumulated gains and losses are
 recognised in the profit and loss account in the same period in
 which the hedged item affects the income statement.
 For derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges, the
 carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for the fair value
 changes attributable to the risk being hedged, with the
 corresponding entry being made in the income statement.  The changes
 in fair value of these derivatives are also recognised in the income
 statement.
 - 21 -
 For derivatives that are designated as hedges of net investments in
 foreign operations, the changes in their fair values are recognised
 directly in equity, to the extent that they are effective, with the
 ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement.  Where
 non-derivatives such as foreign currency borrowings are designated
 as net investment hedges, the relevant exchange differences are
 similarly recognised.  The accumulated gains and losses are
 recognised in the income statement when the foreign operation is
 disposed of.
 For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not
 designated as hedges, the changes in their fair values are
 recognised in the income statement in the period in which they
 arise.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0057A -14-
 Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is
 derecognised (e.g. through expiry or disposal), or no longer
 qualifies for hedge accounting.  Where the hedged item is a forecast
 transaction, the related gains and losses remain in equity until the
 transaction takes place, when they are removed from equity in the
 same manner as for cash flow hedges as described above.
 When a hedged future transaction is no longer expected to occur, any
 related gains and losses, previously recognised in equity, are
 immediately recognised in the income statement.
 Application of IAS32 and IAS39:  As noted above, the Group has
 adopted IFRS for the first time in 2005.  It has applied the
 financial instruments' standards IAS32 and IAS39 prospectively from
 1 January 2005, as permitted by these two standards.  The impact of
 this application is set out in the notes and reflects the following
 changes from UK GAAP:
 - The measurement of available-for-sale investments at fair value;
 - The measurement of all derivative financial instruments at fair
 value and the designation of derivatives as qualifying hedges
 wherever possible;
 - Derecognition of deferred gains on derivatives that were reported
 under UK GAAP as assets and liabilities; and
 - Interest accruals reclassified from other receivables/payables to
 form part of the carrying value of the related asset or liability.
 For 2004, financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with
 UK GAAP and thus are not comparable with the amounts reported for
 2005.  However, the relevant balance sheet amounts for 2004 have
 been classified in accordance with those for 2005.  Also, as an aid
 to comparability in the relevant notes to the accounts, the
 disclosures have also been restated as at 1 January 2005 to comply
 with the requirements of IAS32 and 39.

 16  Dividends
 Final dividend distributions to the Company's shareholders are
 recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements in the
 period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's
 shareholders, while interim dividend distributions are recognised in
 the period in which the dividends are declared.
 17  Segmental analysis
 A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is
 engaged in providing products or services within a particular
 economic environment and the Group's geographical segments form the
 focus of the Group's internal reporting systems. The Group is a
 single product business providing cigarettes and other tobacco
 products. While the Group has clearly differentiated brands, global
 segmentation between a wide portfolio of brands is not part of the
 regular internally reported financial information. It is not
 feasible to segment global results without a high degree of
 estimation, especially given that geographically the same operations
 are used to produce the different brands and brand results are
 managed in the context of the geographic markets in which they are
 sold.
 The prices agreed between Group companies for intra group sales of
 materials, manufactured goods, charges for royalties, commissions,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0057A -14-
 services and fees are based on normal commercial practices which
 would apply between independent businesses. Royalty income, less
 related expenditure, is included in the region in which the licensor
 is based.
 18  Contingent liabilities
 Subsidiaries and associated companies are defendants in tobacco
 related litigation.  Provision for this litigation would be made at
 such time as an unfavourable outcome became probable and the amount
 could be reasonably estimated.
 The Group records its external legal fees and other external defence
 costs for tobacco related litigation as these costs are incurred.
 19  Repurchase of share capital
 When share capital is repurchased the amount of consideration paid,
 including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a charge in
 equity.  Repurchased shares which are not cancelled, or shares
 purchased for the Employee Share Ownership Trusts, are classified as
 treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.

In addition to the reclassifications noted above, sales through
 the Navigator platform that were previously excluded from investment
 sales figures and were reported separately have now been included.
 This change increases the total investment sales figure by GBP310
 million for the first quarter of 2006 (2005: GBP178 million). If
 sales through the Navigator platform had not been included in investment
 sales, the total long-term savings growth for the first quarter
 of 2006 would be 24%.                                              Cumulative (GBP million)

 Present value of life new business premiums
 The present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) is derived from the single premiums and regular 
premiums of the products sold during the financial period and is expressed at the point of sale.
 The PVNBP calculation is equal to total single premium sales received in the year plus the discounted 
value of regular premiums expected to be received over the term of the new contracts. The premium volumes 
and projection assumptions used to calculate the present value of regular premiums for each product are

the same as those used to calculate new business contribution, so the components of the new business 
margin are on a consistent basis.
 The discounted value of regular premiums is also expressed as annualised regular premiums multiplied by a 
Weighted Average Capitalisation Factor(WACF). The WACF will vary over time depending on the mix of new 
products sold, the average outstanding term of the new contracts and the projection assumptions. The table 
below sets out the factors required to derive the present value of regular premiums by business units, and 
combined with single premium sales derives the present value of future new business premiums.

Notes to the Preliminary Announcement
 1          BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 The results for the full year ended 31 December 2002 have been prepared in accordance with UK generally 
accepted accounting principles.  The accounting policies applied are those set out in AstraZeneca PLC's 
2001 Annual Report and Form 20-F except that, in the current period, AstraZeneca adopted Financial 
Reporting Standard No. 19 "Deferred Tax".  Prior periods have been restated and the effects of this 
restatement were to reduce profits for the full year ended 31 December 2001 by $61m and reduce net assets 
at that date by $193m.  The table below illustrates the effect on EPS before exceptional items of this 
restatement.
 The results for the year ended 31 December 2002 presented in this preliminary announcement are extracted 
from, and are consistent with, those in the Group's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 
December 2002 and those financial statements will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies following the 
Company's Annual General Meeting.

As part of AstraZeneca's objective to align with accounting best practice, cash discounts arising from 
prompt payment of invoices have been reclassified from cost of sales to sales.  Comparatives have also 
been reclassified for consistency of presentation.  Both sales and cost of sales have been reduced by $74m 
in the fourth quarter 2002 and $287m in the current year (2001 $258m, 2000 $221m).  Furthermore, neither 
profits nor net assets have been affected.  The change has minimal impact on previously stated sales 
growth rates.    The reclassified quarterly sales figures are presented below.  Additional detail at the 
product and territorial level are available on the AstraZeneca website.

 The tax assessed differs from the standard
 rate of
 corporation tax in the UK (30%). The
 differences are explained below:
 Loss on ordinary activities before tax            (5,566,150)  (7,195,665)

In respect of subsidiary companies operating in Hong Kong, provisions for Hong Kong profits tax are 
calculated at 17.5% (2004: 17.5%) of the estimated assessable profits for the year.
 Subsidiary companies operating in the People's Republic of China are subject to Enterprise Income Tax 
('EIT') at rates ranging from 15% to 33%. However, certain subsidiaries are subject to tax holidays from 
the local tax authorities under income tax law.  Others had tax losses brought forward from previous 
years. Accordingly, no provision for EIT has been made for the year.
 No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of the overseas subsidiary companies, as no 
dividend payments due to UK parent company are expected to be made in the foreseeable future.  A deferred 
tax asset of US$71,939 (2004: US$16,864) has not been recognised in respect of tax losses carried forward 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of future taxable profits against which these losses can be offset.
 8              LOSS PER SHARE
 Basic loss per share for the year is based on a loss of US$5,907,500 (2004: US$7,168,582) and the 
weighted average number of shares in issue of 1,978,895,097 (2004: 1,978,017,406).
 Dilutive loss per share for 2005 and 2004 is equivalent to basic loss per share as the effect of dilutive 
potential ordinary shares would decrease the net loss per share and so the potential ordinary shares are 
not treated as dilutive in accordance with FRS22 Earnings per share.

 -------------------------------------------------  ----------------  ----------------
IAS 1 requires income from associates to be presented net of tax on the face of the income statement. The 
associates' tax is no longer included within the Group's total tax charge. Associates' tax included within 
'Net income from associates' for the year ended 31 December 2005 is $274 million (2004: $280 million).
 The effective rate of taxation before special items and remeasurements including share of associates' tax 
before special items and remeasurements was 26.5%. This was a decrease from the equivalent effective rate 
of 27.7% in the year ended 31 December 2004. The reduction in the effective tax rate was principally due 
to a reduction in the South African statutory rate from 30% to 29% and a reduction in the Ghanaian tax 
rate, which resulted in a $187 million reduction in deferred tax, the benefit of which was taken in 2005. 
Without this one off benefit the effective tax rate for the period would have been 29.7%. In future 
periods it is expected the effective tax rate, including associates' tax, will remain at or above current 
levels.

(1) Basic and diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding represent the weighted average for the period.  
The average number of ordinary shares in issue             excludes the shares held by the employee 
benefit trust.
 (2) Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
 'Underlying earnings' is an alternative earnings measure, which the directors believe provides a clearer 
picture of the underlying financial performance of the Group's operations following the adoption of IAS 32 
and IAS 39. Underlying earnings is presented after minority interest and excludes special items and 
remeasurements (see note 4).  Underlying earnings is distinct from 'headline earnings', which is a 
Johannesburg Stock Exchange ('JSE Ltd') defined performance measure.
 The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share, based on underlying earnings, uses the following 
earnings data:

 Overall, the operating loss increased from GBP7.8m in 2004 to GBP11.0m.
 Net finance income was GBP4.4m (2004: GBP2.1m) and benefited from a one off payment of GBP2.1m following 
the release of the funds in the escrow account as noted below.
 The Group has recognised Research and Development tax credits of GBP0.4m (2004: GBP0.5m) which are 
receivable from the Inland Revenue.  This is as a result of the Group having been classed as a small or medium 
sized enterprise (SME) since 2004.  A deferred tax credit of GBP0.1m (2004: GBPnil) was recognized in the Income 
Statement in respect of the amortisation of the intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of CellMed and this 
took the total income tax credit to GBP0.5m (2004: GBP0.5m).
 A further gain on sale of discontinued operations of GBP1.4m was made, following an additional provision release, 
leaving the remaining disposal provision balance at GBP1.9m to cover the liabilities associated with the remaining 
warranties and indemnities given as part of the 2002 disposals of the cardiovascular, eyecare and urology divisions.
 At the year-end the Group had 91 employees (2004: 74) and the increase reflects the employees joining the Group 
on the acquisition of CellMed.
 Isostent Lawsuit and Return of Capital
 In May 2005, Biocompatibles announced settlement of the Isostent Litigation.  As a result Abbott authorised the 
release of the GBP17.6m of funds held in an escrow account.  The escrow was security for the indemnity provided 
by Biocompatibles as part of the sale of the cardiovascular business to Abbott in respect of the Isostent Litigation.  
The indemnity remains in place.
 Release of the escrow resulted in the transfer of funds of GBP17.6m from other receivables to cash in the 
Company's Balance Sheet and GBP2.1m of interest receivable has been recognised in the Company's Income 
Statement.  On 14 September the UK High Court approved the reduction in the Company's share premium account 
and this allowed the payment of 29p per share (GBP11.6m) by the end of September.  The share capital was 
subject to a sub-division and consolidation on the basis of 83 new 21 53/94p shares for every 94 existing 19 4/99p 
shares.
 Cash Flow
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0064A -3-
 The net cash used in operating activities was GBP7.4m (2004: GBP7.3m).  Net cash generated from investing 
activities was GBP16.2m (2004: GBP0.9m).  This primarily represented the cash inflow from the release of the 
funds in escrow less the cash spent in acquiring CellMed.  Net cash used in financing activities was GBP11.9m 
(2004: cash inflow GBP0.8m), mainly relating to the return of capital.
 Balance Sheet
 Net assets at 31 December 2005 were GBP37.6m (2004: GBP48.5m).  These included net funds(1) of GBP41.0m 
(2004: GBP45.2m) and goodwill and intangible assets arising from the acquisition of CellMed of GBP9.2m (2004: 
GBPnil). The creditor relating to the royalty prepaid by Abbott decreased from GBP5.3m to GBP5.1m in the year 
due to the recognition of royalty income arising from Abbott's sales of its Dexamet stent.
 CellMed AG Acquisition
 In March 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of 100 per cent. of the shares of CellMed AG.  A detailed 
description of the terms of this acquisition were included in the Financial Review in the 2004 Annual Report. The 
consolidated financial statements include CellMed's results from 7 March 2005.
 2005 Sales and Cash Expectation
 The Company expects total 2006 cash outflow to be GBP10m. The increase reflects the investment in clinical 
expenditure on the PRECISION V trial and the growth in marketing expenditure for the DC Bead.  This will leave 
our cash, cash equivalents and available for sale financial assets at around GBP31.0m at the end of the year.
 The Company expects to achieve consolidated sales in the range of GBP5m to GBP6.5m, the mid point of which 
represents growth of approximately 69%.  Sales growth in 2006 is expected from continued growth in sales of the 
Bead products and from development income from CellMed's cosmetic dermatology programme.

Management Statement
 2003 was a year of good progress with higher profits, better investment performance and reduced net business 
outflows.
 Despite the rise in equity markets from the second quarter of 2003, average market levels were lower than in 2002.  
Driven by lower costs, underlying asset management profit, before project expenditure and redundancy costs, rose 
5.2 per cent. to GBP81.0 million (2002: GBP77.0 million).  Asset management net revenues were GBP417.8 
million, down 5.1 per cent. from GBP440.4 million in the previous year.
 Profit from private equity was GBP16.8 million (2002: GBP12.9 million) as we benefited from carried interests and 
realisations from Schroder Ventures funds, the rise in the share price of Schroder Ventures International Investment 
Trust plc (SVIIT) and the realised gain from the sale of 5.9 per cent. of SVIIT in March 2003.
 Group costs at GBP406.2 million were GBP63.9 million lower than the previous year and GBP113.8 million lower 
than in 2001.
 Profit before goodwill was GBP75.9 million (2002: GBP29.5 million) and profit before tax was GBP65.6 million 
(2002: GBP18.9 million).
 Funds Under Management
 From an opening position of GBP86.2 billion at the end of December 2002, adjusted to exclude GBP2.1 billion on 
the completion of the sales of Schroder Hermes and Schroder Pensions in January and February 2003 
respectively, funds under management rose 14.0 per cent. to GBP98.3 billion during the period.  Net business 
outflows were GBP0.5 billion, an improvement from the net outflows of GBP2.2 billion in 2002.
 In September a simpler management structure was introduced to extend the improvement in investment 
performance and combine the Group's business development and client service skills across institutional and retail.  
Asset management now operates through four divisions: Investment, Distribution, Private Banking and 
Infrastructure.
 Investment
 During 2003, we continued to invest in strengthening our portfolio management and research capabilities.  None of 
the cost reduction achieved over the past two years has been at the expense of our investment platform.  This year 
we expect to spend more on portfolio management and research than we did in either 2002 or 2003.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0009A
 We generated good investment performance across a range of key products during the year, including UK equities, 
specialist European equities, Pacific Basin equities and international fixed income.  Our UK multi-asset pooled fund 
has also outperformed its benchmark over three and five years.  However, further improvement is required in some 
other asset classes.
 We added to our product offerings during the year with a US tax-exempt fixed income capability which has started 
well, two further single strategy hedge funds, new property and private equity funds and a range of structured 
products.
 Distribution
 Overall net outflows of institutional funds were GBP4.3 billion, down from GBP5.4 billion in 2002. Institutional funds 
under management ended the year at GBP71.2 billion.*
 The net outflow was due in part to underperformance in some asset classes but, as importantly, to restructuring by 
clients in the UK and elsewhere from balanced and multi-asset mandates to specialist mandates.  The latter was 
the major factor underlying a net outflow in the UK of GBP3.7 billion.
 There was a net outflow of GBP1.5 billion from our Americas business, due to weak international equity 
performance.  We saw good net inflows in continental Europe of GBP1.1 billion and a small net outflow in Asia 
Pacific with the "daiko henjo" effect in Japan, as corporate pension plans returned assets to Government schemes, 
offsetting strong new business flows elsewhere.
 Net retail sales were GBP4.2 billion, against GBP3.5 billion in 2002.  Retail funds under management ended the 
year at GBP22.1 billion.*
 Retail fund performance continued to be strong with two-thirds of UK and Luxembourg domiciled retail assets 
above the peer group median.  This is reflected in the high proportion of our funds rated by Standard & Poors, the 
37 awards won by our funds around the world and our being named as Investment Management House of 2003 by 
Financial Times Fund Ratings.
 New retail business flows were well diversified geographically.  In the UK and continental Europe net sales were 
GBP2.6 billion.  In Japan we had another strong year with net sales of GBP900 million, and a further GBP700 
million of net inflows elsewhere in Asia Pacific.
 Investor demand for more actively managed funds is growing and we have followed the success of our UK Alpha 
fund with the launch of other Alpha products in European and Japanese asset classes.  We have also seen a high 
level of interest in our multi-manager offering.
 *  See Note at end of section
 Private Banking
 Net outflows during the year, including the transfer of a small book of business to another private bank, amounted 
to GBP0.4 billion.  Private banking funds under management ended the year at GBP5.0 billion*.
 The Private Bank provides solutions-led, bespoke asset management and banking services predominantly for high 
net worth individuals.  In 2003 we strengthened our client relationship, marketing and banking teams and introduced 
new administration systems in London and Zurich which will shortly be extended to the Channel Islands.
 The Private Bank is now positioned to deliver superior risk adjusted returns and a broader range of specialist 
banking products supported by an efficient systems platform.  The benefits of this are starting to come through in 
terms of business flows and revenues.
 Board Changes
 Andrew Sykes leaves the Board in March 2004 and he goes with the Board's thanks and good wishes after 25 
years with the Group.
 In November 2003, in the context of the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance, we announced that 
Charles Sinclair and Nicholas Ferguson, who have served as non-executive Directors since 1990 and 2001 
respectively, will retire from the Board at the 2004 Annual General Meeting in April.  The Board would like to thank 
them for their major contribution to the Group.
 We also announced in November that Sir Peter Job, who joined the Board in 1999 as a non-executive Director, 
had been appointed as the Senior Independent Director.

register at 26th March 2004, which brings the total dividend to 18.5 pence per share, unchanged on 2002.

Notes to the Interim Statement
 1     BASIS OF PREPARATION
 The interim financial information has been prepared in accordance with the principal accounting policies 
of the Group as set out in the Group's 2006 annual report and financial statements.
 The financial information set out in this report does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in 
section 240 of the Companies Act 1985. The figures for the year ended 31 March 2006 have been extracted 
from the statutory accounts, which have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The auditors' report 
on these financial statements was unqualified and did not contain a statement under section 237(2) of the 
Companies Act 1985.
 The interim financial statements have been reviewed by the company's auditors. A copy of the auditor's 
review report is attached to the interim report.
 Changes in accounting policy
 Share based payments
 The company operates equity-settled share option schemes under which options have been granted to 
employees (including directors). The group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS20 and 
has applied FRS20 only to options which vest after 31 March 2006.
 The fair value of share options granted is recognised as employee benefit cost with a corresponding 
increase in the share-based payment reserve. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the 
period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using a Black Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual 
number of share options that vest.
 The effect of the change in accounting policy is a charge to the profit and loss account of GBP18,854 and 
the creation of a share options reserve in the balance sheet.
 2     TAXATION
 The Group has received to date R&D tax credits totalling GBP570,008 for financial years ending 31 March 
2002 and 31 March 2003. The Group has submitted claims for R&D tax credits for the financial years ending 
31 March 2004 and 31 March 2005 totalling GBP509,037. As for all companies that have received these 
credits, the amounts are subject to potential future HM Revenue & Customs claw back.
 3     current asset investment
 All current asset investments relate to the Company's investment in IDOX plc, an AIM listed UK company. 
The stock exchange value of the Group's holding in IDOX plc at 30 September 2006 was GBP343,095, compared 
to a book value of GBP571,358. Subsequent to the period end the value of the share price has fallen. The 
market value at 15 November 2006 was GBP245,068. This fall in market value has not been reflected in the 
interim financial statements on the grounds that the directors believe it to be temporary.
 4     (LOSS) / EARNINGS PER SHARE
 The (loss) / earnings per share is calculated by reference to the (loss) / profit attributed to ordinary 
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period, as follows:

The notes presented on pages 16 to 47 form an integral part of the consolidated and Parent Company 
financial statements.
 1.   Significant accounting policies
 Significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements of AS Eesti 
Telekom (the parent company) and its subsidiary companies (together referred as "the Group") are set out 
below.
 Statement of compliance
 The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the financial statements of the parent company are 
prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
 The financial statements present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of 
the Group and the parent company.
 The preparation of the annual financial statements involves estimates made by the Management Board of the 
parent company about circumstances that influence the Group's and the parent company's assets and 
liabilities as of the balance sheet date, and about income received and expenses incurred during the 
financial year. These estimates are based upon up-to-date information about the state of the Group and 
take into consideration the Group's plans and risks as they stand at the date of the financial statements' 
preparation. The actual results may differ from the estimates.
 Basis of preparation
 The financial statements are presented in thousands of Estonian kroons (EEK), unless indicated otherwise.
 The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial 
instruments that are stated at their fair value.
 The main accounting policies applied in preparation of the financial statements are presented below.
 Principles of consolidation
 The consolidated financial statements include all significant subsidiaries that are controlled by the 
parent company. When an entity began or ceased to be controlled during the year, the results are included 
only from the date control commenced to the date control ceased. Control is presumed to exist where more 
than one half of the subsidiary's voting power is controlled by the parent company, or the parent company 
is able to govern the financial and operation policies of the subsidiary, or control the removal or 
appointment of a majority of the subsidiary's supervisory council.
 Group companies use in all material aspects the same accounting principles. In case the accounting 
principles are changed, the comparative data from previous periods is also changed retrospectively.
 All inter-company transactions and balances, also unearned profits and losses have been eliminated.
 Minority interests in the equity and financial results of subsidiaries are shown as a separate line item 
in the consolidated financial statements.
 Foreign currency
 Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange quoted by the Bank of Estonia 
on the transaction date. On the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange quoted by the Bank of Estonia on that date. Respective 
exchange differences are recognised in the income statement for the year.
 The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded at the Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank) 
effective exchange rates. Upon the acquisition of a foreign subsidiary, the parent company's share of the 
net assets of the subsidiary is established and recorded, using the exchange rate prevailing on the date 
of acquisition. These parts of the equity of the subsidiary will maintain their acquisition value even 
after the rest of the subsidiary's balance sheet has been retranslated. If a foreign subsidiary issues 
shares, these shares are recorded, using the exchange rate on the day of the issuance. Concerning the 
following consolidation of the balance sheet of a foreign subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are 
recorded, using the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are 
recorded, using the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences, which arise, are charged 
to equity and transferred to the Group's recorded reserve. Such recording differences are recognised as 
income from, or as expenses of, subsidiaries in the period in which the operation has taken place. A 
recorded reserve in consolidated equity is considered in the calculation of the results of sales of shares 
of a subsidiary.

 The Shanghai operation should allow revenues to grow much faster than costs from now on. The Board 
believes that Shanghai's re-emergence as a major financial centre also presents Lombard Risk with 
significant local revenue opportunities over coming years in addition to the cost benefits of offshore 
development.
 With our revenues for the full year expected to grow at around 50% p.a. on a like for like basis, our 
hope and expectation is that the company's share price will be a candidate for significant re-rating once 
we demonstrate a return to sustained profitability. There is of course still work to do before we reach 
that point, and we also want to complete the spin-out of the independent valuation business during that 
period. Our team and I are confident that profitability for the software business is now achievable in the 
next few months.
 I would like to thank all my colleagues, as well as our advisors, for their hard work and support.
 J M Wisbey
 Chairman & CEO
 23 November 2006
 The interim report was approved by the Board of Directors on 22 November 2006
 Introduction
 We have been instructed by the company to review the financial information for the six months ended 30 
September 2006 which comprises the consolidated profit and loss account, consolidated balance sheet, 
consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 8. We have read the other information 
contained in the interim report which comprises only the Chairman's Statement and considered whether it 
contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial information. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
 This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with guidance contained in 
APB Bulletin 1999/4 "Review of Interim Financial Information". Our review work has been undertaken so that 
we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in a review report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our review work, 
for this report, or for the conclusion we have formed.
 Directors' responsibilities
 The interim report including the financial information contained therein is the responsibility of, and 
has been approved by, the directors. They are responsible for preparing the interim report and ensuring 
that the accounting policies and presentation applied to the interim figures should be consistent with 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0017A -2-
those applied in preparing the preceding annual accounts except where any changes, and the reasons for 
them, are disclosed.
 Review work performed
 We conducted our review in accordance with guidance contained in Bulletin 1999/4 "Review of Interim 
Financial Information" issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review 
consists principally of making enquiries of management and applying analytical procedures to the financial 
information and underlying financial data and, based thereon, assessing whether the accounting policies 
and presentation have been consistently applied unless otherwise disclosed. A review excludes audit 
procedures such as tests of controls and verification of assets, liabilities and transactions. It is 
substantially less in scope than an audit performed in accordance with International Standards of Auditing 
(UK & Ireland) and therefore provides a lower level of assurance than an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion on the financial information.
 Review conclusion
 On the basis of our review we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the 
financial information as presented for the six months ended 30 September 2006.

 The maintenance and integrity of the Lombard Risk Management plc website is the responsibility of the 
directors: the interim review does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the 
company's reporting accountants accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the 
interim report since it was initially presented on the website.
 Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the interim report 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

8.        Pension schemes
 Pension costs are accounted for in accordance with the UK accounting standard, SSAP24.  A new UK 
financial reporting standard, FRS17:  Retirement Benefits requires additional information to be disclosed 
based on methodologies set out in the standard which are different from those used under SSAP24 and by the 
scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
 Reed Elsevier operates a number of pension schemes around the world.  The major schemes are of the 
defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds. The two largest schemes, 
which cover the majority of employees, are in the UK and US. The main UK scheme was subject to a triennial 
valuation by Watson Wyatt Partners as at 5 April 2003.  The main US scheme is valued annually and was 
subject to a valuation by Towers Perrin as at 1 January 2003. The actuarial values placed on scheme assets 
under SSAP24 as at their last valuation date were sufficient to cover 113% and 104% of the benefits that 
had accrued to members of the main UK and US schemes, respectively.
 The net pension charge was GBP59m/EUR86m (2002: GBP59m/EUR94m).  Pension contributions made in the year 
amounted to GBP47m/EUR68m (2002: GBP47m/EUR75m).  The net SSAP24 charge on the main UK scheme comprises a 
regular cost of GBP23m/EUR33m (2002: GBP27m/EUR43m), less amortisation of the net actuarial surplus of 
GBP13m/EUR19m (2002: GBP24m/EUR38m).  Based on the advice of scheme actuaries, no employer contributions 
have been made to the main UK scheme in 2003 and, with effect from 1 January 2004, employer contributions 
will be made at a rate of 5% of pensionable salaries until the next triennial valuation in 2006.
 At 31 December 2003, the aggregate net deficit in respect of the defined benefit schemes under FRS17 
comprised GBP189m/EUR268m (2002: GBP66m/EUR101m) in respect of funded schemes and liabilities of 
GBP62m/EUR88m (2002: GBP71m/EUR109m) in respect of unfunded schemes, of which GBP52m/EUR74m (2002: 
GBP52m/EUR80m) is provided for within creditors under SSAP24.
 Basis of preparation
 The Reed Elsevier PLC share of the Reed Elsevier combined results has been calculated on the basis of the 
52.9% economic interest of the Reed Elsevier PLC shareholders in the Reed Elsevier combined businesses, 
after taking account of results arising in Reed Elsevier PLC and its subsidiary undertakings. Reed 
Elsevier PLC's 52.9% economic interest in the net assets of the combined businesses is shown in the 
balance sheet as interests in joint ventures, net of the other assets and liabilities reported within Reed 
Elsevier PLC and its subsidiary undertakings.  Adjusted figures, which exclude the amortisation of 
goodwill and intangible assets, exceptional items and related tax effects, are presented as additional 
performance measures.

Adjusted earnings per share is based upon the Reed Elsevier PLC shareholders' 52.9% share of the adjusted profit 
attributable of the Reed Elsevier combined businesses. Tax on profit on ordinary activities includes GBP97m (2002: 
GBP56m) in respect of joint ventures.
 Dividends
 The directors of Reed Elsevier PLC have proposed a final dividend of 8.7p per ordinary share (2002: 8.0p) which, 
when added to the interim dividend already paid of 3.3p per ordinary share (2002: 3.2p), amounts to a total 2003 
dividend of 12.0p per ordinary share (2002: 11.2p), an increase of 7%. The Reed Elsevier PLC final dividend will be 
paid on 21 May 2004, with an ex-dividend and record date of 28 April 2004 and 30 April 2004 respectively. 
Dividends paid to Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV shareholders are equalised at the gross level inclusive 
of the UK tax credit received by certain Reed Elsevier PLC shareholders. The equalisation adjustment equalises the 
benefit of the tax credit between the two sets of shareholders in accordance with the equalisation agreement.

of convertible bonds, the Management of the Parent Company decided not to separate  and disclose the equity

registered by the court as at 30 June 2004. The share capital increase was registered on 28 July 2004.

 We have audited the annual accounts of AS Eesti Telekom ("the Parent") and of AS Eesti Telekom and its 
subsidiaries ("the Group") for the year ended 31 December 2004. These annual accounts are the 
responsibility of the Parent's Management Board. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
annual accounts based on our audit.
 We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards require 
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts are 
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the annual accounts. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by the management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of 
the annual accounts. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 In our opinion, the annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
the Parent and the Group as of 31 December 2004, the results of their operations and their cash flows for 
the year then ended, in accordance with Estonian Accounting Law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards.

 Notes on IFRS adjustments
 Discontinued operations
 Under IFRS, non-current assets and groups of assets to be disposed of are classified as assets held for 
sale if their      carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. The assets and       associated liabilities of Andover Controls have been reclassified as 
held for sale at 26 June 2004. The results of    discontinued businesses are reported separately in the 
income statement (see note 4).

Body
 British Land uses derivatives to manage its interest rate risk.  In accordance with UK GAAP British Land's 
derivatives are not valued when they are hedges and any income or costs are recognised in the profit and loss 
account consistently with the underlying hedged transaction.  IAS requires all derivatives, whether cash flow hedges 
or fair value hedges, to be carried at their fair values in the balance sheet.  The disclosures in note 14 to the interim 
statement shows the fair values of the Group's derivatives.  The hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 reduce the 
sensitivity of the profit and loss account to movements in the fair values of cash flow hedge derivatives.  IAS 
prescribes a number of stringent tests to determine whether or not derivatives qualify as effective hedges.  The 
Group expects to account for its current portfolio of interest rate derivatives as effective hedges.
 Dividends
 Unlike UK GAAP which requires proposed final dividends to be accrued, IAS only permits recognition of the liability 
to pay a final dividend when this has been approved by the shareholders.  This will lead to a one off increase in net 
asset value by the net cost of the proposed dividend.

PROPERTY REVIEW
 Property is continuing to be an attractive investment class, combining a regular income flow from 
committed rents with longer term capital appreciation from rental growth and/or tightening of yields.  
Institutional and private investor demand has increased substantially across all property sectors.
 Valuation: up 3.8%, adding GBP400 million
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0072A -4-
 The external valuation of the British Land portfolio, including its share of joint ventures at 30 
September 2004 was GBP11,065.9 million, an increase in the six months since 31 March 2004 of 3.8% (GBP400 
million: including the valuation movement in developments, purchases and capital expenditure, and 
excluding sales).
 Values have increased in every sector of the portfolio.  Our retail assets have risen by 4.3% in the six 
months: retail warehouses continue to outperform, ahead 9% and high street shops are up 5.7%.  The office 
portfolio increased in value by 3.4%, with the City, despite a testing letting market, putting on 3.2% 
primarily due to the quality of the properties and the successful letting of the developments.
 Details of the valuation by use and data for the portfolio's long lease profile and current reversions 
are shown on the tables at the front of this section.  Due to negotiation of new long leases and active 
management, the weighted average lease term has been maintained at 16.9 years (15.7 years to first break).
 The majority of the property valuations were carried out by ATIS REAL Weatheralls, whose commentary on 
the commercial property market follows this review.
 Activity: investment in preferred sectors
 Purchases of GBP153 million, including joint venture properties, were completed during the six months to 
September 2004, and acquisitions of a further GBP491 million of property were completed in October 2004. 
Principal transactions were:
 --              the investment of GBP97.1 million in Songbird Estates plc, representing 15.8% of the 
consortium which acquired 66.3% of Canary Wharf Group PLC;

 The share option programme allows group employees to acquire shares of the company.  The fair value of 
options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in employee share 
options reserve. The fair value of the options granted is measured at grant date and spread over the 
period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.  The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using the Black Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the options were granted.   The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the 
actual number of share options that vest, except where forfeiture is due to the share option achieving the 
vesting conditions.
 The following is a summary of the assumptions used to calculate the fair value:

23.2 Assumptions, changes in assumptions and sensitivity
 a)    Process used to decide on assumptions
 The peer review reserving process
 Beazley uses a quarterly dual track process to set its reserve:
 --      The actuarial team uses several actuarial and statistical methods to estimate the ultimate 
premium and claims costs. The most appropriate methods are selected depending on the nature of each class 
of business; and
 --      The underwriting teams concurrently review the development of the incurred loss ratio over time, 
work with our claims managers to set specific reserve estimates for flagged claims and utilise their 
detailed understanding of the risks underwritten to establish an alternative estimate of ultimate claims 
cost which are compared to the actuarially established figures.
 A formal internal peer review process is then undertaken to determine the reserves held for accounting 
purposes which, in totality, is not lower than the actuarially established.  The group also commissions an 
annual independent review by the group's syndicate reporting actuary to ensure that the reserves 
established are reasonable.
 Actuarial assumptions
 Chain-ladder techniques are applied to premiums, paid claims and incurred claims (i.e. paid claims plus 
case estimates).  The basic technique involves the analysis of historical claims development factors and 
the selection of estimated development factors based on historical patterns.  The selected development 
factors are then applied to cumulative claims data for each underwriting year that is not yet fully 
developed to produce an estimated ultimate claims cost for each underwriting year.
 Chain-ladder techniques are most appropriate for classes of business that have a relatively stable 
development pattern.  Chain-ladder techniques are less suitable in cases in which the insurer does not 
have a developed claims history for a particular class of business or for underwriting years that are 
still at immature stages of development where there is a relatively higher level of assumption volatility.
 The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses a combination of a benchmark/market-based estimate and an estimate 
based on claims experience.  The former is based on a measure of exposure such as premiums; the latter is 
based on the paid or incurred claims observed to date.  The two estimates are combined using a formula 
that gives more weight to the experience-based estimate as time passes.  This technique has been used in 
situations where developed claims experience was not available for the projection (i.e. recent 
underwriting years or new classes of business).
 The expected loss ratio method uses a benchmark/market-based estimate applied to the expected premium and 
is used for classes with little or no relevant historical data.

 We are delighted to have announced today a ten-year extension to our ongoing contract with Manchester 
Airport (see separate announcement). The contract is expected to realise turnover in excess of GBP800 
million over the ten years and involves the delivery of retail services in all three of Manchester's 
terminals.
 Strategic Review
 Following my appointment in May, I initiated a review of the Group's strategy.  Whilst, as for any group, 
this is an ongoing process, a number of key issues have already become apparent.
 There is no doubt that Alpha has world-class examples of tax and duty free stores and capabilities in the 
provision of catering on aircraft.  What is essential, though, is that we concentrate on ensuring that we 
maximise returns on those markets where we have scale or can achieve scale either with existing facilities 
or through acquisition.
 In the more developed markets in which we operate, there is intense competition for new contracts in both 
airline and airport services.  For example, in places such as the UK, returns are not as good as those, 
for instance, in emerging economies.  However, as an international business with international customers, 
it is imperative that we have a well established domestic business which then qualifies us for the new 
business opportunities that exist in emerging markets.
 Consequently, we will continue to operate only in those countries where we have scale or believe we can 
achieve scale.  In all markets, we will review each contract and each retail outlet to ensure that we have 
the correct focus and return on capital employed.
 Another key issue for our longer-term strategy is innovation.  Alpha, has since its inception been a 
pioneer in inflight catering and duty and tax free retailing in the UK/Europe and we must continue to 
exploit this strength.
 More recently Alpha has pioneered the buy-on-board and the Blue Sky Services menu concept which has been 
very successful with airlines such as MyTravel.  In both our markets there is a danger that the only 
comparison is one of price.  Whilst cost is obviously an important issue for our customers, it is 
important that Alpha continues to provide innovation in its offer to differentiate itself from its 
competitors.
 Outlook
 Security issues around the world continue to influence the Board's view of performance in the second half 
of the current financial year.
 It is estimated that the initial impact of the UK security issues in August impacted that month's 
operating profit by approximately GBP0.3m.  During September, there has been a gradual return towards 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0018A -2-
normality but airport retailing continues to be affected by lower passenger spending.  The recent easing 
of hand baggage restrictions is welcome but it will take time to restore confidence fully in air travel 
and it is too early to form views about the longer term.
 Our overseas operations, particularly in Jordan and Sri Lanka, have their own security issues. However, 
Alpha has a reputation for its innovation and flexibility which will stand it in good stead in a rapidly 
changing environment.
 Our domestic markets remain very competitive.  Some consolidation in the UK is a possibility and Alpha 
will look to take advantage of any suitable opportunities that might arise   There are also a number of 
potential international opportunities which would enable us to leverage Alpha's management skills and 
industry knowledge.
 The second half of the year remains a challenge but we are confident that the full-year results will 
subject to the current security concerns, be in line with our expectations.

 Operational Review
 Biocompatibles made good progress in 2005 - with the PRECISION I clinical trial data establishing the 
benefit of the PRECISION Bead Products in HCC and providing a basis for evaluating the drug eluting bead 
technology in other indications.
 In the 2005 Annual Report the Company established twelve goals that were planned for announcement during 
the course of the year, the most important of which were achieved.  A review of the 2005 goals is shown 
below:

Body
 With the acquisition of International Bioproducts Inc in September 2003, the Group acquired a 21% holding in 
Tecra Holdings Pty Limited, a company registered in Australia. International Bioproducts Inc is a distributor of Tecra 
products in North America. Following the acquisition of Tecra Holdings Pty Limited in June 2004, the transactions 
and balances previously treated as related party transactions have been included in the consolidated accounts for 
the Group.
 11  Transition to IFRS
 As stated in the accounting policies note, these are the Group's first condensed consolidated interim financial 
statements for part of the period covered by the first IFRS annual consolidated financial statements prepared in 
accordance with IFRS.
 The accounting policies have been applied in preparing the condensed consolidated interim financial statements 
for the six months ended 30 June 2005, the comparative information for the six months ended 30 June 2004, the 
comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 
January 2004 (the Group's date of transition).
 In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, comparative information for the six months ended 30 June 2004 and 
for the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements 
prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
 An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the Group's financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows is set out in the following tables and the notes that accompany the tables.
 Notes to the adjustments made for the transition to IFRS from UK GAAP:
 Dividends
 Under UK GAAP dividends proposed were included in the group accounts and dividends proposed and paid were 
shown on the face of the profits and loss account. In accordance with IFRS we have only included dividends paid in 
these accounts and they are shown as a movement on reserves. The details of the dividends paid and proposed 
are shown in note 4.
 Share options
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0066A -8-
 In accordance with IFRS 2 share options granted since 7 November 2002 have been valued at the date of grant 
and this value is being amortised over the vesting period of the options in issue. This charge is effective from 1 
January 2004 and the equivalent amount is credited to retained profits in the balance sheet.
 Goodwill
 Under UK GAAP the Group's policy was to amortise goodwill over 20 years. Under IFRS 3 there is no amortisation 
of goodwill, so goodwill amortisation charged in 2004 has been excluded from the restated accounts and the 
carrying value of goodwill on the balance sheet is retained at the value stated under UK GAAP at the start of 2004.
 Foreign exchange forward contracts
 Under UK GAAP the notional gains and losses on future forward exchange contracts were noted in the accounts, 
but not recognised in the results for the Group. Under IFRS the fair value of these contracts is recognised in the 
balance sheet at the period end date, with the equivalent amount shown in the hedging reserve. This treatment is 
permissible as the contracts are 100% effective as a hedge of future cash flows.
 Gains or losses included in the hedging reserve are then recycled to profit or loss when the forecasted transaction 
occurs.  This change in accounting has been applied only from 1 January 2005 as an opening balance adjustment 
at that date.
 Impairment reviews
 Under IFRS an impairment review is required every year for tangible and intangible assets that have not been 
amortised. An impairment review of goodwill has been carried out and no adjustments are required.
 Reconciliation between comparative figures under IFRS and previously published data (UK GAAP).

 The Group holds financial instruments in order to finance its operations and to manage interest rate and currency 
risks.  Group operations are financed by means of retained profits and a mixture of both short and medium term 
debts.  The Group borrows, through banks and from related parties, in local currencies at fixed rates.  The Group 
does not trade in any way in financial instruments.
 The principal risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and exchange 
rate risk.  The Group board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are 
summarised below.  These policies have been developed during the current accounting period as a consequence of 
the Group's expansion.
 Financial instruments such as investments in and advances to subsidiary undertakings and short term debtors and 
creditors have been excluded from the disclosures below.
 Details of security are given in note 15.

Interest rate risk
 Group borrowings are held in local currencies.  Current loans are at fixed rates.  The Group's policy for future 
borrowings will be to take floating rates unless fixed rate finance is available at particularly attractive rates.

 The directors consider that the fair value of the Group's financial assets and liabilities was the same 
as their carrying value.
 Liquidity risk
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0012A -5-
 The Group's policy is to ensure that sufficient facilities would be available to satisfy its peak 
borrowing requirements.  As at 31 December 2005, the Group was within its bank borrowing facilities.  The 
Group had drawn down all committed borrowing facilities at the year end.
 Foreign currency risk
 All trading is undertaken in local currencies.  Funding is also in local currencies other than inter- 
company investments and loans and it is not the Group's policy to cover these amounts as the date of 
repayment is uncertain.

Body
 The investments committee has established guidelines for the group's investment managers regarding the type, 
duration and quality of investments acceptable to the group.  The performance of investment managers is regularly 
reviewed to confirm adherence to these guidelines.
 2.3 Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk arises where cash may not be available to pay obligations when due at a reasonable cost.  The group 
is exposed to daily calls on its available cash resources, principally from claims arising from its insurance business.  
In the majority of the cases, these claims are settled from the premiums received.
 The group's approach is to manage its liquidity position so that it can reasonably survive a significant individual or 
market loss event.  This means that the group maintains sufficient liquid assets, or assets that can be translated 
into liquid assets at short notice and without any significant capital loss, to meet expected cash flow requirements.  
These liquid funds are regularly monitored using cash flow forecasting to ensure that surplus funds are invested to 
achieve a higher rate of return.
 The following is an analysis by business segment of the estimated timing of the net cash flows based on the claims 
liabilities balance held at 31 December 2006:

2.4 Market risk
 Market risk arises where the value of assets and liabilities changes as a result of movements in foreign 
exchange rates, interest rates and market prices.
 Foreign exchange risk
 The group is exposed to changes in the value of assets and liabilities due to movements in foreign 
exchange rates.  The group deals in four main currencies, US dollars, UK sterling, Canadian dollars and 
Euros. Transactions in all other currencies are converted to UK sterling on initial recognition.
 The group manages foreign exchange exposure by projecting forward its US dollar profits for each calendar 
year and selling one twelfth of the expected amount each month.  The amounts sold are periodically 
validated against actual exposure and additional "top up" trades of US dollars are made if required.  The 
foreign exchange exposure to Canadian dollars and Euros are closely monitored by the group and a similar 
approach will be taken to manage the risk as our exposure grows in the future.
 The group also has investment in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies that are different from 
the presentational currency.  This gives rise to an exposure to US dollars, Hong Kong dollars and 
Singapore dollars, although the exposures to Hong Kong dollars and Singapore dollars are minimal.   The US 
dollar exposure is managed by borrowing funds denominated in the same currency.
 The following table summarises the carrying value of total assets and total liabilities categorised by

The net assets have been stated net of the cross-currency swap as explained in note 24.
 Sensitivity analysis
 If the US dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro weakened against the UK sterling by 10%, with all other variables constant, 
pre-tax profit would have been lower by an estimated GBP12.4m (2005: GBP5.5m) and net assets would have 
decreased by an estimated GBP10.8m (2005: GBP5.0m).  The analysis is based on the current information 
available and our assumptions in performing this analysis are:
 -  the closing year end spot rates and the average rates throughout the year were 10% higher;
 -  no hedging of currency during the period;

 -  the analysis includes an estimate of the impact on our foreign borrowings and cross currency swaps; and
 -  the impact of foreign exchange on non-monetary items will be nil.
 Interest rate risk
 Some of the group's financial instruments, including financial investments, cash and cash equivalents and 
borrowings, are exposed to movements in market interest rates.
 The group manages interest rate risk by investing in short duration financial investments and cash and cash 
equivalents.  The investment committee monitors the duration of these assets on a regular basis.
 The following table shows the average duration of the financial instruments.  Duration is a commonly used 
measure of volatility and we believe gives a better indication than maturity of the likely sensitivity of our portfolio to 
changes in interest rates.

The Company considers EBITDA margin, ROACE, ROAE, upstream operating expenses/bbl and operating 
expenses for oil and gas production/boe and the related indicators as important measures of its operating 
performance. In addition, these measures are frequently used by financial analysts, investors and other interested 
parties in the evaluation of oil and gas companies. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should 
not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's operating results as reported under 
U.S. GAAP.
 EBITDA/bbl and EBITDA/boe are calculated for any period by dividing EBITDA for that period by the barrels of 
crude oil or barrels of oil equivalent, respectively, produced during that period.  No adjustments to these measures 
are made to take into account the effect of changes in inventories during the period.
 Upstream capital expenditures/bbl and upstream capital expenditures/boe are calculated for any period by dividing 
the capital expenditures in the upstream segment during that period by the barrels of crude oil or barrels of oil 
equivalent, respectively, produced during that period.
 Upstream operating expenses/bbl and upstream operating expenses/boe are calculated for any period by dividing 
the production and operating expenses of the upstream segment during that period by the barrels of crude oil or 
barrels of oil equivalent, respectively, produced during that period. No adjustments to these measures are made to 
take into account the effect of changes in inventories during the period.
 Upstream operating expenses include lifting costs, and the costs of gathering, treating, processing and storing the 
crude oil and gas in the fields and delivering the crude oil and gas to a main pipeline (e.g., a Transneft trunk 
pipeline transshipment).  Operating expenses of oil and gas production exclude a portion of the costs relating to 
intersegment transactions, mainly operating leases relating to certain oil and gas facilities.

For calculation of key financial measures refer to the section "Selected financial performance 
indicators".
 Main Factors Affecting Results of Operations
 The main factors that have affected Rosneft's results of operations during the period being analyzed, and 
that can be expected to affect its results of operations in the future, are
 --      Changes in crude oil and refined product prices;
 --      RUB/USD exchange rate movements and inflation;
 --      Changes in mineral production tax and export customs duty; and
 --      Changes in transport tariffs.
 Changes in prices, export customs duty and transport tariffs can have a significant impact on the mix of 
products and export routes the Company chooses, as it seeks to maximize netback prices for the crude oil 
it produces.
 Changes in Crude Oil, Petroleum Product and Gas Prices
 The prices of crude oil and petroleum products internationally and in Russia have a significant impact on 
the Company's results of operations. World prices for crude oil are characterized by significant 
fluctuations that are determined by the global balance of supply and demand.  These prices have increased 
in recent years, and are currently high.  The crude oil that Rosneft exports through the Transneft 
pipeline system is blended with oil of other producers that is of a different quality. The resulting Urals 
blend is traded at a discount to Brent. Russian domestic market prices for crude oil are difficult to 
determine, mainly due to the significant intragroup turnover of the vertically integrated oil companies 
that dominate the market. Moreover, to the extent they exist, crude oil market prices in Russia can be 
significantly lower than they might otherwise be due to seasonal oversupply and regional imbalances.
 The dynamics of petroleum product prices in the international and Russian markets are determined by a 
number of factors, the most important among them being the level of world prices of crude oil, supply and 
demand for petroleum products, competition in the different markets and distances separating them from the 
refineries where the crude oil is refined into usable end products or intermediate products.

 -  Regular monitoring of outstanding debtor position by our reinsurance security committee.
 In addition we provide against reinsurance recoveries that are impaired. At the end of 2006 we had 
provided GBP4.8m (2005: GBP5.2m) in respect of our reinsurance recoveries.
 Insurance liabilities
 Insurance liabilities of GBP1,225.6m consist of two main elements; unearned premiums reserve ("UPR"), and 
gross insurance claims.
 -  Our unearned premiums reserve (UPR) has increased by 34% in 2006 to GBP359.6m, mainly due to increased 
premiums written. The bulk of the UPR relates to the 2006 year which has been written at favourable rates.  
This business will earn through to our income statement in 2007.
 -  Gross insurance claims are made up of claims which have been notified to us but not yet paid and an 
estimate of incurred but not yet reported claims (IBNR). These are estimated by both the underwriter and 
the syndicate actuary through the quarterly peer review process, a description of which is included in 
note 23. Gross insurance claims increased by 4% in 2006 to GBP866.0m mainly due to the increase in 
business written.
 Borrowings
 Historically we have relied on short-term banking facilities to support our underwriting at Lloyd's and 
the US operation. This was typically issued in the form of letters of credit, although we could draw down 
physical cash if required to pre-defined limits. As a condition of this type of debt, we also had to 
comply with certain banking covenants; minimum levels of net assets, realistic disaster scenario events 
and profitability. The facility was also renegotiated every two years.
 To provide us with greater flexibility over our capital, we issued longer-term debt in October 2006.  We 
raised GBP150m of lower tier 2 long-term subordinated debt through a fixed rate debenture. The proceeds 
will be used to replace the existing short-term facilities and to support opportunities to grow the 
business as they arise.  The issue is callable on 17 October 2016 and bears an initial interest rate of 
7.25% payable in arrears. We retained GBP50m of the short-term debt in the form of a letter of credit 
facility, led by Lloyds TSB, to provide additional capital should the requirement arise.
 At the time of the issue we entered into a derivative transaction, whereby we better matched our 
investment and currency risk by swapping the sterling fixed rate loan into the equivalent of:
 -  GBP107m of floating rate sterling loans; and
 -  US$80m of floating rate US dollar loans.
 These items have been accounted for using hedge accounting for both the floating rate and currency 
elements of the transaction.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0014A -7-
 Currency profit hedging
 Our policy is to minimise our largest foreign exchange currency risk-exposure, which is to the US dollar. 
This is managed by estimating our US dollar profits each year and selling a proportion each month.  We 
also sell our year-end unhedged profits for our second largest currency exposure, Euros, once a year. In 
2006, the group sold US$108.5m at an average exchange rate of 1.88 (2005: 1.87).
 CAPITAL POSITION
 The group has two requirements for capital:
 1.    To support underwriting at Lloyd's through syndicate 2623, this is based on the group's own 
individual capital adequacy. This may be provided in the form of either the group's cash and investments 
or debt facilities; and
 2.    To support underwriting in Beazley Insurance Company, Inc. in the US.
 Our funding comes from a variety of sources:
 1.    GBP319.6m comes from our shareholders own funds (i.e. net assets). Of this balance, GBP81m is 
unavailable to the group at present because it relates to fixed assets or undistributable syndicate 
profits.
 2.    GBP150m was raised in 2006 through a tier 2 subordinated debt issue;
 3.    An undrawn banking facility of GBP50m (2005: GBP150m) provided by a syndicate of banks led by 
Lloyds TSB; and
 4.    The final source of funds comes from our US$18m subordinated long term debt with a maturity in 
2034.

Individual capital assessment
 Historically our capital requirements were set using Lloyd's risk based capital (RBC) model.  The RBC 
model assessed the risk posed by the proposed business plan based on historical market average data.  The 
capital regime changed in 2005, so that syndicates make their own assessment of risk in their ICA.  2006 
was the first full year where our capital requirements were determined by its ICA.
 In order to determine its ICA, we made significant investment in both models and process:
 --      we use sophisticated mathematical models that reflect the key risks in the business allowing for 
probability of occurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between risk types.  A key focus of 
these models is to understand the risk posed by individual teams, and to the business as a whole, of a 
possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle; and
 --      The ICA process is embedded so that the teams can see the direct and objective link between 
underwriting decisions and the capital allocated to that team.  This gives a consistent and comprehensive 
picture of the risk reward profile of the business and allows teams to focus on strategies that improve 
return on capital.
 This robust ICA process demonstrates that the business is well diversified and stable.  This is reflected 
in our capital requirement of 42% of premium capacity, a reduction from 47% of premium capacity in 2006. 
This equates to a capital requirement of GBP292m.

Body
 Pilot is a shallow heavy-oil accumulation defined by four exploration and appraisal wells, including one extended 
well test, technical work by Venture has led to agreement to drill a further appraisal well to establish and better 
define recoverable economic reserves. A geotechnical drill ship, the Bucentaur, has been contracted to drill this well 
in the second half 2006. This low cost solution enables Venture to obtain a full understanding of the potential 
commerciality of the field for minimum capital outlay.
 Following a successful Pilot well, the Bucentaur will drill an appraisal of the 28/2-1 discovery well immediately 
south of the Pilot field. This block was awarded 100% to Venture in September 2005 as part of the 23(rd) licence 
round and the Company has moved quickly to assess the potential of this heavy oil discovery well drilled in 1993 by 
using the contracted drill ship.
 Selkirk
 Located in Block 22/22a Venture has a 31.5% non-operated interest in the Selkirk field. The operator (Nexen) 
plans to drill an appraisal well in the fourth quarter 2006 to assess development options for the field. This 
accumulation may be a suitable candidate for development using the SSP-300 production vessel.
 Acorn and Beechnut
 Venture acquired majority interests and operatorship in the Acorn and Beechnut fields through several transactions 
in 2005. Acorn was discovered in 1983 and Beechnut in 1985 and both fields tested oil from their respective 
discovery wells. Several development options exist for these fields including conventional sub-sea tie-backs or a 
floating solution and Venture is looking at a joint development of these fields with production by 2010.
 Halley and Appleton
 Venture is currently reviewing the Halley and Appleton fields to assess the future potential as sub-sea tie-backs to 
nearby infrastructure or as candidates for a floating production solution.
 Exploration Activity
 Through 2005 Venture has made progress with the evaluation of several exploration opportunities in the existing 
portfolio close to our infrastructure.  Of particular note we have identified a potential Audrey satellite, Adele, located 
to the north-east of the Audrey field.  Detailed well planning will commence in the first half of 2006 to support 
potential drilling in 2007.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0067A -5-
 In addition, Block 48/15b, awarded during the 22(nd) Licence round, is the subject of seismic reprocessing, with a 
plan in place to define drillable prospects in 2006 for inclusion in Venture's 2007 drilling programme.
 CONTRACTS
 There was steady growth in the demand for resources required to develop oil and gas fields in 2005. During the 
year Venture created a number of strategic contracts and set up a contract management process to help maximise 
value and agility in delivering successful projects.
 Access to drilling rigs is an essential requirement and during 2005 Venture secured contracts with Noble and 
Transocean for drilling units for both our southern North Sea and central North Sea activity.  Looking ahead Venture 
has secured the Noble Ton van Langeveld semi-submersible drilling rig and the Noble Julie Robertson jack-up 
drilling rig into 2008. This has removed a high level of uncertainty and has enabled the Company to plan for longer-
term growth.
 Access to vessels for diving, remote control vehicles, pipe-lay, tugs and the like is now provided under a preferred 
contractor framework agreement with Subsea 7.  Subsea 7 has elevated Venture to a preferred client basis to 
ensure we can deliver our projects and provide rapid response to inspection, repair and maintenance activities.  
This has been extremely successful through 2005 and continues to provide real value as we move into 2006.
 Access to steel for line pipe and tubulars is achieved by having a framework agreement and excellent relationships 
with Marubeni Itochu Tubulars Europe.  The steel market is extremely tight on a global scale and the Company 
requires access both to steel quotas and steel mills for delivery of pipe that is competitively priced and aggressive in 
terms of deliver dates.
 These major strategic contractors along with our other strategic framework agreements are being managed using 
an integrated project management approach. This has proved to be successful over the last 12 months in project 
delivery, Venture continues to work to further enhance value through driving further improvements in the 
relationships, people and processes to ensure sustainability of project delivery in the longer term.
 The following tables show estimates of proven and probable reserves prepared by the company's engineers in 
accordance with the UK Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) issued by the Oil Industry Accounting 
Committee (July 2001). For total reserves, natural gas is converted to barrels of oil equivalent using a conversion 
factor of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas per barrel.

Reserve Movements
 Venture's 2005 reserves revisions came primarily from reserves upgrades in the Greater Kittiwake Area where field 
performance has proven better than expected (Mallard, Gadwall) and where technical work has resulted in 
upgrades on Goosander and Grouse supported by our ongoing GKA experience. Minor downward reserves 
revisions have been attributed to the 'Trees' hub, based upon the well performance in Sycamore and Larch. The 
reserves additions through acquisition were dominated by the purchase of the CNS assets including Acorn, 
Beechnut, Appleton and Halley, as well as the acquisition of 100% of the undeveloped Ensign field in the SNS.
 In addition to the reserves outlined above, Venture retains an economic interest in approximately 3.16 MMboe of 
proven and probable reserves in Trinidad through its 40% equity stake in Ten Degrees North Energy Limited.

 HENRY BOOT PLC
 INTERIM RESULTS
 Henry Boot PLC, the property and construction group, announces its Interim Results for the half year ended 30th 
June 2006.
 Enquiries: Jamie Boot, Group Managing Director -  Tel.: 0114 255 5444
 CHAIRMAN""S STATEMENT
 The half year to 30th June 2006 was a period of significant progress and sustained growth with an overall profit 
before tax of GBP13.5m being achieved - a 74% increase on the same period last year. Even prior to the inclusion 
of the GBP2.6m property revaluation, a GBP10.9m trading profit was impressive in reflecting a 60% increase over 
the comparative 2005 figure of GBP6.8m.
 The increase in revenue from GBP42.4m to GBP50.7m underpins these excellent headline figures and points 
towards another successful year. However, the increase in profit is unlikely to be maintained to the same extent in 
percentage terms as the half year.
 Our company remains a strategically focused business concentrating on its prime segments of Property (property 
development and investment, land trading) and Construction (building and civil engineering, PFI operation, plant 
hire).
 PROPERTY
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0011A
 Our property development schemes are targeted towards meeting specific market demand. This demand remains 
strong, particularly from retailers who are looking for larger unit accommodation and town centre locations, and from 
companies requiring industrial warehousing and distribution centres where quality space, location and effective 
communication networks are of high priority.
 Ongoing flagship developments include retail schemes at Ayr (Ayr Central), Bromley (The Mall) and South Shields 
(Waterloo Square), and a mixed-use scheme at Nottingham (The Axis). Other projects are warehousing and 
distribution schemes by the M1 in Derbyshire (Markham Vale Business Park), at Hull (Priory Park) and Stoke-on-
Trent (Meir Park).
 Work on 'Stop 24', our exciting motorway service area scheme on the M20 in Kent (the largest MSA in the country), 
has started and is making good progress.
 The half year results included a property sale at Skegness and a land sale at Swindon. Rentals increased by 14% 
from ongoing investment properties. The continuing resurgence of property as an important asset class for major 
investors, with returns running ahead of bonds and equities, fully supports the company's strategies.
 With demand continuing to outstrip supply, there is little sign of the market weakening as evidenced by the margins 
between primary and secondary market investments showing clear signs of erosion.
 Our land trading business goes from strength to strength and a number of important land deals were concluded 
during the first six months of the year. These included land sales at Kettering and further sales at Bathgate and 
Prestonpans in Scotland. Significant progress was also made on our sites at Stotfold, Bedfordshire; Syston, 
Leicestershire; and Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire; the early sales of which should ensure a highly successful 
outturn for the year as a whole.
 Whilst encouraged by these successes, we closely follow the ongoing debate to justify introduction of the Planning 
Gain Supplement, in addition to the present Section 106 system. Also of serious interest is the Government's 
attitude towards 'brown first' embodied in the current 'Planning Policy Guidance 3 Housing'. Its reaction to the 
'brownfield/greenfield' issue is much awaited and, when known, will impact upon the huge expansion proposals for 
housing in the South East and, no doubt, reverberate to other essential housing needs elsewhere in the country.
 The Kate Barker 'Review of Housing Supply', the 'Code for Sustainable Homes', and water management continue 
to dominate the housing agenda although, in essence, market demand for new housing will lead events. Land 
prices will rise whilst the demand for new housing continues, and we will endeavour to stay abreast of such events 
and capitalise on the opportunities that ensue.
 CONSTRUCTION
 Our building and civil engineering activity performed much to expectations, although revenue was down on forecast 
due largely to delays in new framework contracts and Home Office prison work starting on site. Significant contracts 
awarded during the period included our selection as one of four partners to deliver the GBP272m Decent Homes 
refurbishment programme for 2010 Rotherham Limited.
 Road Link (A69) Holdings Limited, our PFI operation and maintenance company, again reported impressive results 
and was 100% successful in meeting its targets in respect of call-outs, street lighting, service requests and 
problems attended to.
 Plant hire suffered generally from increased competition, particularly at the smaller end of our product range, 
resulting in lower utilisation rates and margins. Whilst profitability was below target, it continued to contribute 
positively to overall results. With a number of hire centre relocations in hand, it is anticipated that performance will 
be improved in the second half of the year.
 FINANCIAL POSITION, DIVIDENDS AND OUTLOOK
 At the interim stage, the company's financial strength looks robust. Net assets increased from GBP122.3m at the 
2005 year end to GBP134.5m, including a small reprieve in pension obligations as bond yields rose towards the 
end of the period. Our gearing position increased as net borrowings moved from GBP20.0m at the end of 2005 to 
GBP35.7m in line with our expanding property interests. However, gearing still remains at less than 30% and leaves 
further room for profitable expansion and growth.
 Basic earnings per share grew from 18.5p per share to an impressive 33.7p per share, reflecting the further 
improvement in performance.
 In line with the Board's commitment to a progressive dividend and its expectations of another successful year, the 
directors are recommending an interim dividend of 5.4p per ordinary share, representing just over a 10% increase 
above that for 2005.

16.       Bonds loan
 The Extraordinary General Assembly Meeting held on 11 November 1999 decided to issue convertible bonds 
with a maturity period of four years, and having second priority for repayment after the medium and long 
term loans, which can be traded or transferred into stocks amounting to USD 86.017 million of which USD 59 
million were underwritten in a non public offering and the rest through a public offering.  These bonds 
were issued at a face value of USD 1,000 each, and issued at a discount of 9.025%, in addition to bond 
issuance cost of  USD 0.25 per bond, at an annual variable interest rate of 2.9% over libor of the    US 
dollars (for three months) to be paid every three months.
 The Company is obligated at the end of the second year from the closing date for the bonds' subscription 
to open sinking fund account in favor of the bondholders, where amounts in US dollars are deposited.
 On 1 June 2003 the bondholder's assembly resolved the following:-
 *1-    The early retirement of bonds amounting to USD 40 million at the due date of coupon no. (15) On 12 
October 2003.
 *2-    The maturity date of the remaining bonds amounting to USD 34.136 million - after the early 
retirement - is 31 December 2006.
 3-    Canceling the condition of forming the sinking fund account for the remaining bonds.
 4-    The rest of the bonds issuance conditions remain without amendment.
 *      The early retirement of bonds includes USD 179 000, the value of 179 bonds in favor of Al Ezz 
Steel Mills Company. The remaining bonds include          USD 152 000, the value of 152 bonds in favor of 
Al Ezz Steel Mills Company, and for the purpose of the consolidation, this transaction was eliminated.
 In addition, the Company settled 84 bonds with total amount of USD 84 000 during the financial year ended 
31 December 2004. These bonds represent the rounding up of the amount paid for the early retirement.
 Accordingly, the number of bonds (after excluding the bonds of Al Ezz Steel Mills Company) outstanding as 
of 31 December 2005 amounts to 33 900 bonds with a total value of USD 33.900 million.
 The balance of the bonds loan outstanding at 31 December 2005 comprises the following:

8    Share based payments
 In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2, the recognitions and measurement 
principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to grants made prior to 7 November 2002.
 For grants subsequent to this date the fair values of services received in return for share options 
granted to employees are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.  The estimate 
of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a Black Scholes model (with the 
contractual life of the option and expectations of early exercise incorporated into the model). The 
recipient is required to remain an employee of the company for 3 years before the options can be exercised 
and in addition for the 1997 option scheme the share price must outperform the movement of the FTSE small 
cap index by 2% p.a. over a 3 year period.
 The terms and conditions of the share options granted during the six months ended 30th June 2005 were as 
follows:
Grant        Number of   Vesting conditions       Contractual
 date    share options                         life of option

 9    Financial instruments
 i)    Hedging fluctuations in foreign currency
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0066A -7-
 The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in 
a currency other than Pound Sterling.  The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollars, 
Australian Dollars and Euro.
 The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk. The forward exchange 
contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
 In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than sterling the Group 
ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at 
spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
 The principal repayment amounts of the Group's U.S. Dollar bank loans are naturally hedged by trading 
cash flows.
 ii)   Forecasted transactions
 The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges 
and measures them at fair value.  The fair value of forward exchange contracts at 1 January 2005 was 
adjusted against the opening balance of the hedging reserve at that date (see note 11).  The net fair 
value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted transaction at 30 June 2005 was GBP71,000 
liability, recognised in fair value derivatives.
 iii)  Recognised assets and liabilities
 Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and 
liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in profits 
or loss.  Both the changes in fair value of the forward contracts and the foreign exchange gains and 
losses relating to the monetary items are recognised as part of "net financing costs".  The fair value of 
forward exchange contracts used as economic hedges of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign 
currencies at 30 June 2005 was GBP nil (31 December 2004: nil) recognised in fair value derivatives.
 iv)  Fair values
 The carrying amount of financial instruments is shown below. The fair value of these instruments 
approximates to the carrying value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings and 
because the interest rates are based on floating money market rates in the USA and UK.
 To estimate the fair values of forward exchange contracts, they are marked to market either using listed 
market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.

Base Metals generated its highest ever operating profit of $1,678 million (2004: $1,276 million) on the back of 
record production of nickel, zinc, niobium, zircon and rutile from ongoing operations, with significantly higher metal 
prices. Controllable costs were well contained. However, margins at all operations came under pressure from 
significant rises in the costs of energy and most key consumables, as well as higher freight rates, treatment and 
refining charges in the copper market and increased zinc smelter price participation. The strength of the Chilean, 
South African and Brazilian currencies against the US dollar also adversely impacted operating profit.

Average base metal prices in 2005 exceeded the most optimistic of expectations. Notwithstanding reasonable GDP 
growth, notably in China and the US, slower industrial production and manufacturing growth precipitated destocking 
which, when combined with price-induced substitution and increased scrap usage, resulted in only a modest 
increase in metal demand. Offsetting this was a muted mine supply-side response to higher prices, especially in the 
case of copper where unexpected supply disruptions led to output being some 1 million tonnes lower than forecast. 
Substantial speculative investment inflows were a significant feature of the market in 2005.

 -------------------------  ------  ------
Attributable copper production decreased by 74,300 tonnes due to the disposal of Hudson Bay. Mantoverde 
increased output by 3% to 62,000 tonnes, reflecting higher treatment rates. Production at Mantos Blancos declined 
by 8% to 87,700 tonnes, as a result of a planned reduction in dump leach treatment rates and grades. Los Bronces 
(227,300 tonnes) and El Soldado (66,500 tonnes) also experienced small reductions in production owing to lower 
grades. Attributable production from Collahuasi was 187,900 tonnes (2004: 211,600 tonnes). This was mainly due 
to lower sulphide mill throughput following outages of the ore conveyor and SAG mill No. 3, and lower sulphide ore 
grades after an earthquake and pit wall failures necessitated a rescheduling of the mine plan.
 The $80 million El Soldado pit extension project remains on schedule and within budget. The $21 million Chagres 
de-bottlenecking project, which increases production capacity from 162,000 to 184,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of 
anode/blister from 2006, was successfully completed. The $47 million Collahuasi molybdenum plant was completed 
under budget and ahead of time and will produce between 5,000 and 8,000 tpa of molybdenum, dependent on 
grade. It entered production in November 2005 and is expected to pay back its initial investment within the first six 
months. Los Bronces is scheduled to complete a feasibility study into a possible doubling of production, due for 
completion in 2007, while a significant de-bottlenecking opportunity is currently under evaluation at Collahuasi.
 In May 2005 the final tranche of the Disputada purchase was paid, bringing the total acquisition cost to  $1,395 
million. In the period from 2003 to 2005 Disputada generated an EBITDA of $1,648 million.

Production at Loma de Niquel was marginally down for the year, although output at Codemin rose to 9,600 tonnes 
(2004: 6,500 tonnes) following the successful completion, within budget and on time, of the Codemin 2 project. After 
successful commissioning of the scalping project, niobium production rose 14% to 4,000 tonnes. Improved mineral 
recoveries resulted in a 23% increase in rutile and an 8% rise in zircon production at Namakwa Sands.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0039A -5-
 The feasibility study for the 33,000 tpa Barro Alto nickel project is well advanced and board approval is likely to be 
sought later this year. Namakwa Sands' $43 million project to increase output of rutile by 26% and high margin 
zircon by approximately 20% commencing from 2008 is underway.

ramp-up. Production for the year increased 11% to 132,800 tonnes. Improved performance of the new backfill plant 
at Lisheen allowed secondary mining to commence, resulting in higher head grades and production of zinc 
(159,300 tonnes) and lead (20,800 tonnes) (2004: 156,300 tonnes and 17,200 tonnes respectively). The Black 
Mountain Deeps project was substantially completed, with finalisation of the development of the Deeps mine and 
the ramping up of production now well advanced. With increased access to the Deeps orebody, mining flexibility 
began to improve and zinc and lead grades rose materially, yielding 32,100 tonnes of zinc and 42,200 tonnes of 
lead representing increases of 14% and 13% respectively.
 Outlook
 The outlook for 2006 is good, with strong demand and constrained production increases across the industry. Cost 
pressures are expected to remain intense as the entire supply chain to the industry operates at, or close to, 
capacity. However, the current consensus is one of relatively strong global growth and a weaker US dollar, as 
structural issues resurface and US interest rates approach their peak. Metal inventories are low (in the case of 
copper and nickel) or tightening (in respect of zinc). With the possible exception of zinc, however, and in the 
absence of further supply-side disruptions, base metal markets seem likely to move into a small surplus during 
2006 on the back of increased primary production, substitution and scrap usage. Fluctuating levels of fund interest 
in the sector may, however, influence short-term price movements to a greater extent than fundamentals.

Notes to the Preliminary Results for the Year Ended 31 December 2004
 1. Basis of preparation
 The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. 
The particular accounting policies adopted, which have been consistently applied throughout the current 
and prior year, are described below.
 Accounting convention
 The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
 Basis of consolidation
 The Group has accounted for the acquisition of XP and Forx using the merger method of accounting and all 
other subsidiaries using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 6, 'Acquisitions and Mergers'.
 Goodwill and intangible fixed assets
 For acquisitions of a business, where the acquisition method of accounting is adopted, purchased goodwill 
is capitalised in the year in which it arises and amortised over its estimated useful life up to a maximum 
of 20 years. The directors regard 20 years as a reasonable maximum for the estimated useful life of 
goodwill. Capitalised purchased goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included within intangible fixed 
assets.
 Tangible fixed assets
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0003A -4-
 Depreciation is provided on cost in equal annual instalments over the estimated lives of the assets.  The 
rates of depreciation are as follows:
 Plant and machinery                             - 25 - 33%
 Motor vehicles                                     -            25%
 Office equipment                                 -            25 - 33%
 Leasehold improvements                      -            10% or over the life of the lease if shorter
 Long leasehold land and buildings        -            Term of the lease
 Investments
 Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
 Associates
 In the Group financial statements investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. 
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Group's share of associates' profits less losses, 
while the Group's share of the net assets of the associates is shown in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out 
above. Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in 
associates.
 Stocks
 Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  Cost represents material and 
appropriate overheads based on normal levels of activity.
 Deferred taxation
 Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance 
sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when 
they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.  Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items 
of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are 
included in the financial statements.  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not 
discounted.
 Foreign currency
 Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the 
dates of the transactions.
 Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
translated at the rates ruling at that date. These translation differences are dealt with in the profit 
and loss account.
 The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the average rates for the 
period. The exchange differences arising as a result of restating retained profits to closing rates are 
dealt with as a movement on reserves.
 Leases
 Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual 
instalments over the period of the leases.
 Pension costs
 The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for its employees. Contributions are charged to 
the profit and loss account as they become payable.
 Research and development
 Expenditure on research and development is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it 
is incurred.
 2. Segmental analysis
 The Group operates substantially in one class of business, providing power supply solutions to the 
electronics industry. Analysis of total Group operating profit, net assets, turnover and total Group 
operating profit by geographical region is set out below.

Body
 The choice of selected results for each underwriting year of each class of business depends on an 
assessment of the technique that has been most appropriate to observed historical developments.  In 
certain instances, this has meant that different techniques or combinations of techniques have been 
selected for individual underwriting years or groups of underwriting years within the same class of 
business.  As such, there are many assumptions used to estimate general insurance liabilities.
 We also review triangulations of the paid/outstanding claim ratios as a way of monitoring any changes in 
the strength of the outstanding claim estimates between underwriting years so that adjustment can be made 
to mitigate any subsequent over or under reserving.  To date, this analysis indicates no systematic change 
to the outstanding claim strength across underwriting years.
 Where a significantly large loss impacts an underwriting year (e.g. the events of 11 September 2001 and 
the hurricanes in 2004 and 2005), its development is usually very different from the attritional losses.  
In these situations, the large loss is extracted from the remainder of the data and analysed separately by 
the respective claims managers using exposure analysis of the policies in force in the areas affected.
 Further assumptions are required to convert gross of reinsurance estimates of ultimate claims cost to a 
net of reinsurance level and to establish reserves for unallocated claims handling expenses and 
reinsurance bad debt.
 b)    Major assumptions
 The main assumption underlying these techniques is that the group's past claims development experience 
(with appropriate adjustments for known changes) can be used to project future claims development and 
hence ultimate claims costs.  As such these methods extrapolate the development of premiums, paid and 
incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers for each underwriting year based on the 
observed development of earlier years.
 Throughout, judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for 
example, to reflect changes in external or market factors such as economic conditions, public attitudes to 
claiming, levels of claims inflation, premium rate changes, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as 
internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures.
 c) Changes in assumptions
 As already discussed, general insurance business requires many different assumptions.  Given the range of 
assumptions used, the group's profit or loss is relatively insensitive to changes to a particular 
assumption used for an underwriting year/class combination.  However, the group's profit or loss is 
potentially more sensitive to a systematic change in assumptions that affect many classes, such as 
judicial changes or when catastrophes produce more claims than expected.  The group uses a range of risk 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0014A -21-
mitigation strategies to reduce the volatility including the purchase of reinsurance.  In addition, the 
group holds additional capital as ICA.
 The net of reinsurance estimates of ultimate claims costs on the 2004 and prior underwriting years has 
improved by GBP31.0m during 2006 (2005: GBP12.2m).  This movement has arisen from a combination of better 
than expected claims experience coupled with small changes to the many assumptions reacting to the 
observed experience and anticipating any changes as a result of the new business written.
 d) Sensitivity analysis
 The estimation of IBNR reserves for future claim notifications is subject to a greater degree of 
uncertainty than the estimation of the outstanding claims already notified.  This is particularly true for 
the specialty lines business, which will typically display greater variations between initial estimates 
and final outcomes as a result of the greater degree of difficulty in estimating these reserves. The 
estimation of IBNR reserves for other business written is generally subject to less variability as claims 
are generally reported and settled relatively quickly.
 As such, our reserving assumptions contain a reasonable margin for prudence given the uncertainties 
inherent in the insurance business underwritten, particularly on the longer tailed specialty lines 
classes.
 Since March 2005, we have identified a range of possible outcomes for each class and underwriting year 
combination directly from our ICA process.  Comparing these with our pricing assumptions and reserving 
estimates gives our management team increased clarity into our perceived reserving strength and relative 
uncertainties of the business written.
 To illustrate the robustness of our reserves, the loss development tables below provide information about 
historical claims development by the four segments - specialty lines, property, reinsurance and marine. 
The tables are by underwriting year which in our view provides the most transparent reserving basis.  We 
have supplied tables for both ultimate gross claims and ultimate net claims.
 The top part of the table illustrates how the group's estimate of claims ratio for each underwriting year 
has changed at successive year-ends. The bottom half of the table reconciles the gross and net claims to 
the amount appearing in the balance sheet.
 While the information in the table provides a historical perspective on the adequacy of the claims 
liabilities established in previous years, users of these financial statements are cautioned against 
extrapolating redundancies or deficiencies of the past on current claims liabilities. The group believes 
that the estimate of total claims liabilities as at 31 December 2006 are adequate.  However, due to 
inherent uncertainties in the reserving process, it cannot be assured that such balances will ultimately 
prove to be adequate.

On an IFRS statutory basis, the Group profit before taxation has increased by EUR5m to EUR1,326m.  The 
benefit arising from the grossing up of policy-holders tax paid on long term assurance contracts in our 
Life Business and the effect of IFRS 3 which requires that goodwill is no longer amortised, but subject to 
annual impairment review, were largely offset by changes in lease accounting, the cost of employee share 
option schemes and higher pension costs.
 Group profit for the year reduced by EUR26m to EUR1,054m mainly as a result of the cost of employee share 
option schemes, higher pension costs and changes in lease accounting, offset somewhat by the benefit of 
not amortising
 goodwill.   The impact on the Group EPS amounts to 2.8c of a reduction to 111.1c.
 For the year to 31 March 2005, on a pro-forma IFRS basis, profit before tax reduced by EUR90m to 
EUR1,236m.  The main changes relate to income recognition on financial assets, which reduced profit before 
taxation by EUR32m and changes in the insurance business (IFRS4/IAS39 versus Embedded Value Accounting), 
which reduced profit before tax by EUR54m.  The Group profit for the year was reduced by EUR71m to 
EUR983m, and Group EPS reduced by 7.1c to 104.0c as a result of these changes.

 On an IFRS pro-forma basis the Group Profit before tax is EUR33m lower arising from the effect of income 
recognition on loans which reduced profit before taxation by EUR15m, and changes in the insurance business 
(IFRS4/IAS39 versus Embedded Value Accounting) which reduced profit before tax by EUR13m.  Group profit

 2.2    Balance Sheet
 Application of IFRS also affects the reporting balance sheet of the Group.  In addition, new regulatory 
treatments apply to the calculation of Tier 1 and total capital.
 As a result of the restatement of the Group's 31 March 2005 results under IFRS and together with the 
impact of IAS32, IAS39 and IFRS4, the effect on stockholders funds and regulatory capital of the Group is

Notes to the Financial Statements
 Year ended 31 December 2005
 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 Basis of accounting
 The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
 Basis of consolidation
 On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are recorded at their 
fair value, reflecting their condition at the date of acquisition.
 The consolidated profit and loss account and consolidated balance sheet include the financial statements 
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December. The results of subsidiaries acquired are 
included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date on which control passes. Intra-group 
sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation.
 As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account is not 
presented in respect of the Company.
 Turnover
 Turnover comprises the invoiced value of sales relating to the period in respect of trading, operation of 
a power plant and a terminal and provision of shipping logistic services.
 Goodwill
 Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over 
the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and will be amortised through the profit and loss 
account over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years on a straight line basis.
 Provision is made for any impairment in the carrying value of the goodwill to the extent that the asset's 
recoverable value in use is reduced below its carrying value.
 Tangible assets
 Expenditure on additions and improvements is capitalized as incurred. Fixed assets are included at 
historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
 Tangible fixed assets, other than construction in progress, are depreciated over their estimated useful 
lives on a straight line basis. The following annual rates of depreciation have been used.

10 years
 Construction in progress represents a building under construction, which is stated at cost less any 
impairment. Cost comprises the direct cost of construction. Construction in progress is reclassified to 
the appropriate category of tangible fixed assets when completed and ready for use.
 Stock
 Stock is valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
 Foreign currencies
 Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenues, costs and non-monetary assets are translated at the exchange 
rates ruling at the transaction date.
 Profit and losses arising from currency transactions and on settlement of amounts receivable and payable 
in foreign currencies are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
 Differences on exchange arising from the translation of the assets, liabilities and results of foreign 
subsidiaries are taken directly to exchange reserve.
 Deferred taxation
 Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at 
the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the 
future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.  Timing 
differences are differences between the group's taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from 
those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
 Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which 
timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.  Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
 Liquid resources
 In accordance with FRS 1 Cash flow statements, for cash flow purposes, cash includes net cash in hand and 
bank deposits payable on demand within one working day, and liquid resources include all of the Group's 
other bank deposits.
 Pension costs
 The Group contributes to defined contribution pension schemes including the Hong Kong Mandatory Provident 
Fund Scheme and the People's Republic of China Central Pension Scheme. Contributions are charged to the 
profit and loss account in the period as incurred.
 LEASED ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS
 Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership ("finance 
leases"), the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright.  The amount capitalised is the 
present value of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease term.  The corresponding leasing 
commitments are shown as obligations to the lessor.
 Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements, and the interest is charged to 
the profit and loss account in proportion to the remaining balance outstanding.
 All other leases are "operating leases" and the annual rentals are charged to profit and loss on a 
straight line basis over the lease term.

At 31 December 2003, a guarantee was given by the Company's subsidiary, Keen Chance Terminal (GZ) Company 
Limited ("KCT") for banking facilities granted to a fellow investor, Miaotou Economic Development Company Limited 
("MEDCL"), in KCT (see note 26(b)).
 The Group obtained land use right and real estates certificates on the terminal's land under short leases from the 
local land authority. Land with a value of US$ 1,378,309 held under unspecified leases of the terminal is land held 
for industrial use for which the relevant land use right certificate was not obtained and thus the term of the lease has 
yet to be agreed.
 Included in the land and buildings of the power plant are short leases land on which the power plant, related ash 
storage pools and ancillary facilities are located. In addition, they also include land held for industrial use in respect 
of which the Group has not obtained the relevant land use right certificate.
 Under the law of the People's Republic of China, the land held for industrial use and the buildings without building 
ownership certificates can only be used for identified industrial purposes. The Group did not obtain any building 
ownership certificates in respect of the buildings of the Group.  The Group cannot legally sell or mortgage such 
properties until the relevant land taxes have been paid to the local land authority.  However there is no binding 
agreement for the taxes to be paid.
 At 31 December 2005, the net book value of fixed assets held under finance leases amounted to US$Nil 
(2004:US$3,368).

 * held by a subsidiary of Arko Offshore Holdings Limited
The 40% equity interest in Keen Chance Terminal (GZ) Company Limited "KCT" previously held by Keen Lloyd 
Energy Limited ("KLEL"), a subsidiary of Keen Lloyd Holdings Limited ("KLHL"), has been transferred to ATL.  The 
transfer has been submitted for registration to the relevant PRC authorities.
 Pursuant to an agreement dated 5 April 2002 entered into between KLEL and Miaotou Economic Development 
Company Limited "MEDCL", a shareholder of KCT who held a 30% equity interest in KCT, MEDCL agreed to vote 
in accordance with the instructions of KLEL at board meetings in view of its indebtedness to KLEL, for an 
approximate sum of RMB78 million (equivalent to US$9.4 million), and KLEL intended to convert the outstanding 
loan into the registered capital of KCT.
 On 22 April 2003, KLEL entered into a shareholder agreement with MEDCL and Harbour Economic Development 
Company Limited ("HEDCL"), another shareholder of KCT, whereby all parties agreed that MEDCL has 
unconditionally transferred the authority empowered to its directors representative (including their rights and 
obligations) to KLEL until KLEL transferred the 40% equity interests in KCL to ATL to reiterate the aforesaid 
agreement dated 5 April 2002.
11  INVESTMENTS (continued)
On 16 May 2003, a supplemental agreement was entered into between ATL, KLEL, MEDCL and HEDCL by which 
all parties agreed that the above authority transferred to KLEL would be vested in ATL after KLEL completed the 
transfer of equity interests in KCT to ATL.
 In accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the above agreements, KLEL effectively controls the board 
of KCT and this arrangement has been confirmed by the shareholders of KCT. In 2002, a Hong Kong lawyer 
expressed his view that KCT is a subsidiary of KLEL under Hong Kong Company Law. Control of KLEL has been 
transferred to ATL and therefore in the opinion of the directors, KCT is a subsidiary of ATL under UK Companies 
Act 1985.
 In addition, KCT will be a legal subsidiary of ATL immediately upon the registration of the transfer of the 40% of 
equity in KCT from KLEL to ATL.

 Quarterly results for 2004
 As a result of the adjustments from UK GAAP to IFRS described on the
 preceding pages, the restated quarterly results for 2004 would be as set
 out below.  Under UK GAAP, at the year end, previously reported quarterly
 figures were restated to the average rates for the full year to provide
 comparatives for subsequent quarterly reporting.  Under IFRS, each quarter
 is not restated for subsequent movements in foreign exchange during the
 year and so the figures below remain translated to sterling at the average
 rates for the relevant periods during 2004.

 ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE ADOPTED FROM 1 JANUARY 2005
 1  Basis of Accounting
 The Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with
 International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
 European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985
 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
 The 2005 financial statements are the Group's first consolidated
 financial statements prepared under IFRS, with a transition date of
 1 January 2004. Consequently, the comparative figures for 2004 and
 the Group's balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 have been restated to
 comply with IFRS, with the exception of IAS32 and IAS39 on financial
 instruments which have been applied prospectively from 1 January
 2005.  In addition, IFRS1 "First time adoption of International
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0057A -12-
 Financial Reporting Standards" allows certain exemptions from
 retrospective application of IFRS in the opening balance sheet for
 2004 and where these have been used they are explained in the
 accounting policies below.
 The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
 cost convention except as described in accounting policy 15 below on
 financial instruments.
 2  Basis of consolidation
 The consolidated financial information includes the accounts of
 British American Tobacco p.l.c. and its subsidiary undertakings,
 together with the Group's share of the results of its associates.
 A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group, where control is
 the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the
 entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
 Associates comprise investments in undertakings, which are not
 subsidiary undertakings, where the Group's interest in the equity
 capital is long term and over whose operating and financial policies
 the Group exercises a significant influence. They are accounted for
 using the equity method.
 The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period
 are included from the date of acquisition of a controlling interest
 at which date, for the purposes of consolidation, the purchase
 consideration is allocated between the underlying net assets
 acquired, including intangible assets other than goodwill, on the
 basis of their fair value.
 - 15 -
 The results of subsidiary undertakings which have been sold during
 the year are included up to the date of disposal. The profit or loss
 on sale is calculated by reference to the net asset value at the
 date of disposal, adjusted for purchased goodwill previously
 included on the balance sheet.
 Where accumulated losses applicable to a minority exceed the
 minority's interest in the equity of a subsidiary, the excess is
 allocated to the Group's interest in the subsidiary, except to the
 extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to
 make an additional investment to cover the losses.
 Inter company balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains
 arising from inter company transactions, are eliminated in preparing
 the consolidated financial statements.
 3  Goodwill
 Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to
 annual impairment reviews.  Goodwill represents the excess of the
 cost of acquisition of a subsidiary or associate over the Group's
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0057A -12-
 share of the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.
 Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
 The Group's policy up to and including 1997 was to eliminate
 goodwill against reserves.  Goodwill acquired from 1998 to 31
 December 2003 was capitalised and amortised over its useful economic
 life. As permitted under IFRS1, in respect of acquisitions prior to
 1 January 2004, the classification and accounting treatment of
 business combinations has not been amended on transition to IFRS.
 Goodwill previously written off direct to reserves under UK GAAP is
 not recycled to the income statement on the disposal of the
 subsidiary or associate to which it relates.
 Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included in intangible
 assets. In respect of associates, goodwill is included in the
 carrying value of the investment in the associated company.
 4  Foreign currencies
 The income and cash flow statements of Group undertakings expressed
 in currencies other than sterling are translated to sterling at
 average rates of exchange in each year. Assets and liabilities of
 these undertakings are translated at rates of exchange at the end of
 each year. For high inflation countries, the translation from local
 currencies to sterling makes allowance for the impact of inflation
 on the local currency results.
 - 16 -
 The differences between retained profits of overseas subsidiary and
 associated undertakings translated at average and closing rates of
 exchange are taken to reserves, as are differences arising on the
 retranslation to sterling (using closing rates of exchange) of
 overseas net assets at the beginning of the year.  Any differences
 that have arisen since 1 January 2004 are presented as a separate
 component of equity. As permitted under IFRS1, any differences prior
 to that date are not included in this separate component of equity.
 Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded at the exchange
 rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains
 and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and
 from the translation at year end rates of exchange are recognised in
 the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying

Analysis of movements in loss development tables
 Initial ultimate loss ratios (reading across the first line of each segment)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0014A -22-
 The 2004 and 2005 hurricanes have increased the initial gross and net ultimate loss ratios on the 2004 and 2005 
underwriting years for the property, reinsurance and marine teams compared with the initial 2003 underwriting year 
ratios.
 The initial property 2006 underwriting year gross and net ultimate loss ratios are higher than the initial 2003 
underwriting year ultimate loss ratios because of an increased catastrophe loading following the 2004 and 2005 
hurricanes and due to less favourable underwriting conditions in UK home-owners in 2006.
 The initial reinsurance 2006 underwriting year gross and net ultimate loss ratios are lower than the initial 2003 
underwriting year ultimate loss ratios as a result of the premium rate increases achieved and the changes made to 
the business mix following the 2005 hurricanes.
 Development of ultimate loss ratios (reading down the columns of the tables)
 Specialty lines
 The gross and net ultimate loss ratios on all underwriting years have continued to reduce as the impact of 
increased rates, tighter terms and conditions and an improved claims environment has become clearer.
 Property
 The 2003 underwriting year gross and net ultimate loss ratios have continued to reduce as the level of attritional 
losses has become clear.
 The 2004 underwriting year gross ultimate loss ratio has been relatively stable with better than expected attritional 
claim experience and stable 2004 hurricane estimates offsetting the increase following the 2005 hurricanes.  The 
net ultimate loss ratio has increased slightly from its 12 month position as a result of the additional premiums paid to 
reinstate reinsurance cover ("reinstatement premiums") following the 2005 hurricanes which reduced our net 
premium estimates.
 The 2005 underwriting year reduction has been driven by better than expected attritional claim experience.
 Reinsurance
 All years show reducing ultimate loss ratios over time reflecting our initially cautious reserving philosophy.
 Marine
 The 2003 underwriting year gross and net ultimate loss ratios have continued to reduce as the level of attritional 
losses has become clear.
 During the second development year of the 2004 underwriting year we wrote more premium than expected.  At a 
gross of reinsurance level, the claims impact of the 2005 hurricanes more than offset this additional premium 
thereby increasing the gross ultimate loss ratio.  At a net of reinsurance level, however, the claims impact of the 
hurricanes was less than the additional premium (as a result of the relatively low reinsurance retention) thereby 
reducing the net ultimate loss ratio.  Thereafter, both gross and net ultimate loss ratios have reduced at the end of 
the third development year as a result of better than expected attritional claims experience.
 The 2005 underwriting year reduction has been driven by better than expected attritional claims experience.

The fair value of the borrowings is based on quoted market prices.  When quoted market prices are not available, a 
discounted cash flow model is used based on a current yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.  
The discount rates used in the valuation techniques are based on the borrowing rates.
 In November 2004, the group issued subordinated debt of US $18m to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A (JPMorgan). 
The loan was unsecured and interest was payable at the US London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a margin 
of 3.65% per annum. The subordinated notes are due in November 2034.
 In October 2006, the group issued GBP150m of unsecured fixed/floating rate subordinated notes that are due in 
October 2026 with a first callable date of October 2016.  Interest of 7.25% per annum is paid annually in arrears for 
the period up to October 2016.  From October 2016, the notes will bear annual interest at the rate of 3.28% above 
LIBOR.  The notes were assigned a credit rating of BBB- by S&P's rating services.
 The group entered into a cross currency swap transaction with Lloyds TSB Bank plc (Lloyds TSB) and JPMorgan 
in October 2006.  In exchange for GBP42.3m the group received US$40m from each party which will be finally 
exchanged on termination of the contract, being October 2016.  Lloyds TSB charges interest at US three-month 
LIBOR plus 2.25%, while JPMorgan charges interest at US three-month LIBOR plus 2.23%.  As part of the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0014A -22-
agreement, the group receives interest at 7.25% from both parties.  There is an option to terminate the swaps in 
October 2011 and annually thereafter until October 2016.
 The group also entered into an interest rate swap transaction with Lloyds TSB and JPMorgan in October 2006. 
Under this agreement, the fixed interest rate of 7.25% on the balance of GBP107.7m (GBP53.8m from each party) 
is exchanged for floating interest rate of UK LIBOR plus 2.24% with Lloyds TSB and UK LIBOR plus 2.23% with 
JPMorgan.  This agreement terminates on 17 October 2016 with an optional early termination in October 2011 and 
annually thereafter.

 2006 Outlook
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0067A
 2006 off to an excellent start:
 --      Strong production performance - record first quarter average production 44,272 boepd
 --      Development programme on track to deliver strong growth in 2006 and beyond
 --      Guidance of average production for full year 2006; 40,000 - 42,000 boepd
 Commenting on the results, Mike Wagstaff, Chief Executive of Venture said:
 "2005 was a year of focus and delivery for Venture, during which we saw the impact of our North Sea 
development programme, which commenced in 2004. We brought three brand new fields on stream and 
successfully completed a further nine 'in-field' investment projects.  This development activity led to a 
77% increase in production which in turn delivered record financial performance.  As a result of our 
withdrawal from operations in Trinidad, Venture is now strategically focussed as a pure North Sea 
development and production operator.
 We made seven acquisitions during the year, which has further expanded our inventory of oil and gas 
fields for future development.  In addition, we have put in place the long-term strategic relationships 
with our key contractors to give us access to the equipment and services to enable us to deliver sustained 
growth in a very tight market.  2006 has got off to an excellent start and we are looking at a substantial 
further increase in production this year.  Longer term, with only one third of our 30 North Sea fields on 
stream, we have the asset base, the team and the key partnerships in place to continue to deliver steady 
and sustained growth for the foreseeable future."

2005 saw Venture's North Sea development programme deliver a step change in production levels leading, in 
turn, to record financial performance.  During the year we brought three brand new fields on stream and 
successfully completed a further nine 'in-field' development projects, investing a total of GBP208 million 
in development capital expenditure and acquisitions.  We have seen the benefits of scale and portfolio 
diversification, leading to record production levels in line with our overall expectations and this strong 
performance has continued into 2006.
 Our ongoing development programme is expected to continue to deliver further substantial production 
growth during 2006 and 2007.  In addition, through the acquisitions we made in 2005, we continue to add to 
our North Sea inventory of undeveloped oil and gas fields.  We have put in place a strategic plan to 
develop Venture's business, which is designed to deliver steady and sustained production growth for the 
foreseeable future.  The key elements of this plan are as follows:
 --      Maintain our strategic focus on the acquisition and development of proved but under exploited oil 
and gas fields, known as 'stranded' reserves;
 --      Retain a tight geographic focus as a North Sea development and production company following 
withdrawal from operations in Trinidad;
 --      Develop our portfolio of interests in over 30 North Sea oil and gas fields, only one third of 
which are currently in production;
 --      Exploit Venture's operational and development expertise which we believe offers a real 
competitive advantage; and
 --      Build upon the long term strategic relationships with our core contractors to ensure access to 
key equipment and services, which are a critical part of our development delivery capability.
 In addition to record production, cashflow and earnings, Venture's proven and probable ("2P") reserves 
increased by 29% to 161 million of barrels of oil equivalent ('MMboe'). This was achieved through a 
combination of both acquisitions and organic reserves additions.  Our reserves' replacement ratio for the 
year exceeded 400%, with a three-year average of approximately 600%.
 Financial Results
 Average daily production for 2005 increased 77% to 29,864 barrels of oil equivalent per day ("boepd") 
compared to the previous year (2004: 16,832 boepd).  The average realised sales price of GBP17.35/boe 
represented a 21% increase over the prior year (2004: GBP14.36/boe).  This increase resulted from the rise 
in commodity prices during the year for both oil and natural gas, offset by production hedged at prices 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0067A
below current market levels.   As a result, turnover for the year more than doubled to GBP164.1 million, 
(2004: GBP81.5 million).  Group profitability benefited from increased production volumes, higher realised 
commodity prices and lower unit lifting costs, due to higher production volumes over relatively fixed cost 
infrastructure.  Excluding the effects of both the Trinidadian impairment recorded in 2004 and the 
adoption of IFRS during 2005, operating profit increased by 259% to GBP83.0 million (2004:  GBP23.1 
million).  Taking into account the adoption of IFRS, Venture recorded a net profit after tax of GBP31.1 
million (2004:  GBP6.9 million loss).
 During 2005 our investment in our North Sea business through development capital expenditures and 
acquisitions more than doubled to GBP208 million (2004:  GBP99.4 million).  This investment programme was 
financed from a combination of operating cashflow, drawing under Venture's credit facilities and by 
raising GBP29 million through a privately placed convertible bond.
 Operational Overview
 The 77% increase in average production rate for 2005 to 29,864 boepd was driven by the impact of both new 
field development activity as well as a substantial number of incremental 'in field' investment projects.  
This growth was achieved in spite of the shut-in of our 'Trees' production hub during the early part of 
the year.  As a result, production during the first quarter averaged only 13,369 boepd and rose almost 
threefold during the year as development projects came on stream, averaging over 39,000 boepd during the 
fourth quarter.
 During 2005, we continued to build our UK natural gas business, which is focussed on our 'A' Fields 
production hub in the southern North Sea.  The operational highlight of the year was the development of 
the Annabel field, which came on stream in April.  Production performance from the field has exceeded 
expectations, thereby enabling us to drill a second production well in the field and this well was brought 
on stream in December.  The nearby ConocoPhillips operated Saturn development came on stream in October 
and to date production performance has also been ahead of forecast.  Development drilling on the field is 
continuing into 2006.  In addition to new field development activity, we drilled one in-fill well in each 
of the Audrey and Ann fields.  Unfortunately, the Audrey in-fill well encountered lower than anticipated 
reservoir pressure, however, the Ann well was successfully completed and brought on stream in early April, 
2006.
 In February 2005, we were able to restore production from 'Trees' that had been shut-in in late 2004 due 
to the gas leak in the riser below the Brae 'A' platform.  Total production levels from 'Trees' increased 
during the year as a result of a successful workover on the main Birch production well and the 
contribution from the South Sycamore production well, which was completed late in the year.
 Production from our Greater Kittiwake Area ("GKA") hub substantially increased as a result of bringing on 
stream the Gadwall oil field in April.  Gadwall has performed better than expectations and this led to the 
drilling of a water injection well, which was completed in early 2006.  During 2005, a new water injection 
well was drilled on Mallard to provide additional pressure support and the field was brought back on 
stream in late 2005 at production rates ahead of expectations.  Development planning on Goosander 
continued with the field receiving field development plan ("FDP") approval in January 2006 and is expected 
to come on stream during the third quarter of this year.

Notes to the Preliminary Results for the Year Ended 31 December 2004
 1. Basis of preparation
 The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. 
The particular accounting policies adopted, which have been consistently applied throughout the current 
and prior year, are described below.
 Accounting convention
 The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
 Basis of consolidation
 The Group has accounted for the acquisition of XP and Forx using the merger method of accounting and all 
other subsidiaries using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 6, 'Acquisitions and Mergers'.
 Goodwill and intangible fixed assets
 For acquisitions of a business, where the acquisition method of accounting is adopted, purchased goodwill 
is capitalised in the year in which it arises and amortised over its estimated useful life up to a maximum 
of 20 years. The directors regard 20 years as a reasonable maximum for the estimated useful life of 
goodwill. Capitalised purchased goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included within intangible fixed 
assets.
 Tangible fixed assets
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0002A -4-
 Depreciation is provided on cost in equal annual instalments over the estimated lives of the assets.  The 
rates of depreciation are as follows:
 Plant and machinery                             - 25 - 33%
 Motor vehicles                                      -            25%
 Office equipment                                   -            25 - 33%
 Leasehold improvements                       -            10% or over the life of the lease if shorter
 Long leasehold land and buildings          -            Term of the lease
 Investments
 Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
 Associates
 In the Group financial statements investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. 
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Group's share of associates' profits less losses, 
while the Group's share of the net assets of the associates is shown in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out 
above. Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in 
associates.
 Stocks
 Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  Cost represents material and 
appropriate overheads based on normal levels of activity.
 Deferred taxation
 Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance 
sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when 
they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.  Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items 
of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are 
included in the financial statements.  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not 
discounted.
 Foreign currency
 Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the 
dates of the transactions.
 Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
translated at the rates ruling at that date. These translation differences are dealt with in the profit 
and loss account.
 The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the average rates for the 
period. The exchange differences arising as a result of restating retained profits to closing rates are 
dealt with as a movement on reserves.
 Leases
 Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual 
instalments over the period of the leases.
 Pension costs
 The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for its employees. Contributions are charged to 
the profit and loss account as they become payable.
 Research and development
 Expenditure on research and development is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it 
is incurred.
 2. Segmental analysis
 The Group operates substantially in one class of business, providing power supply solutions to the 
electronics industry. Analysis of total Group operating profit, net assets, turnover and total Group 
operating profit by geographical region is set out below.

 Profit for the year after special items and remeasurements increased by 0.6% to $3,521 million compared with 
$3,501 million in the prior year. This increase was despite a reduction in net profit on disposals which, including 
associates, was $840 million higher in 2004, with the $464 million profit on the sale of the Group's interest in Gold 
Fields and the $415 million gain on the deemed disposal of AngloGold at the time of the merger with Ashanti.

(2) See note 4 to the financial information
 The Group's results are influenced by a variety of currencies owing to the geographic diversity of the 
Group. The South African rand on average strengthened against the US dollar compared with the prior year, 
with an average exchange rate of R6.37 compared with R6.44 in 2004. Currency movements negatively impacted 
underlying earnings by $88 million. Operating results were impacted by stronger average rates for the 
rand, the Chilean peso, Australian dollar and European currencies although this was partially offset by 
the positive impact on monetary assets and liabilities of the weaker closing rand rate. There was a 
significant positive impact of increased prices amounting to $2.2 billion.
 Special items and remeasurement charges
 Operating special items and remeasurements, including associates, amounted to $640 million with operating 
special charges of $323 million and operating remeasurements of $317 million.
 Operating special charges in respect of impairments, restructurings and mine and operation closures 
amounted to $210 million, including a $31 million loss on the closure of Ergo and a $38 million impairment 
of Bibiani in AngloGold Ashanti and impairment and restructuring of Corrugated assets and goodwill of           
$77 million in Paper and Packaging. Operating special charges also included $113 million for the Group's 
share of a legal provision in respect of its associate De Beers.
 Operating remeasurements, including associates, of $317 million includes $286 million of unrealised 
losses on non-hedge commodity derivatives at AngloGold Ashanti (2004: nil as IAS 39 did not apply). The 
loss in the current year relates to the revaluation of non-hedge derivatives resulting from changes in the 
prevailing spot gold price, exchange rates and interest rates and impacts AngloGold Ashanti's current year 
earnings due to the full adoption of IAS 32 and 39 in 2005.
 Net profit on sale of operations, including associates, amounted to $185 million.  This included a $52 
million profit on sale of Samancor Chrome, $25 million profit on sale of Acerinox, $21 million profit on 
disposal of Boart Longyear and $21m profit on disposal of Wendt. There was also a $27 million profit on 
formation of the Marikana joint venture by Anglo Platinum. These were partially offset by a $57 million 
loss on disposal of Hope Downs.
 Financing remeasurements, including associates, include a $32 million fair value loss on the AngloGold 
Ashanti convertible bond option, unrealised gains of $2 million on non-hedge derivatives and a $72 million 
foreign exchange gain on De Beers dollar preference shares held by a rand denominated entity.
 The option component of the AngloGold Ashanti convertible bond is fair valued at each reporting period 
and held as a liability. Changes in fair value of the liability are taken to the income statement.
 As a result of the adoption of IAS 21 and 28, the US dollar preference shares held by De Beers (a Rand 
functional currency entity) have been reclassified as "financial asset investments" and are retranslated 
at each period end.  The resulting Rand:US dollar foreign exchange gains and losses are reported through 
the income statement as a remeasurement charge.  A currency gain of $72 million has been recorded for the 
year ended 31 December 2005 (2004: loss of $112 million).
 Net finance costs
 Net finance costs excluding finance remeasurement income of $35 million (2004: loss of $112 million) 
increased from $255 million in 2004 to $428 million. The increase reflects lower investment income due to 
the sale of certain investments over the last two years.
 Taxation
 The effective rate of taxation including share of associates' tax before special items was 26.5 %.  This 
was a decrease from the effective rate including share of associates' tax of 27.7% in 2004. The reduction 
in the effective tax rate was principally due to a reduction in the South African statutory rate from 30% 
to 29% and a reduction in the Ghanaian tax rate, which resulted in a $187 million reduction in deferred 
tax, most of the benefit of which was taken in the first half of 2005. Without this one-off benefit the 
effective tax rate for the period would have been 29.7%. In future periods it is expected that the 
effective tax rate, adjusted for associates' tax, will remain at or above the current levels.

 Balance sheet
 Total shareholders' equity was $23,621 million compared with $23,125 million as at 31 December 2004.
 Net debt was $4,993 million, a decrease of $3,250 million from 31 December 2004. The reduction was 
principally due to reduction of debt using cash flows from operations and disposals.  Net debt at 31 
December 2005 comprised $8,439 million of debt, offset by $3,446 million of cash, cash equivalents and 
current financial asset investments. Net debt to total capital(1)  as at 31 December 2005 was 17.0%, 
compared with 25.4% at  31 December 2004.
 Cash flow
 Net cash inflows from operating activities were $6,781 million compared with $5,187 million in 2004. 
EBITDA was $8,959 million, a substantial increase of 27% from $7,031 million in 2004. Depreciation 
increased by $334 million to $2,441 million.
 Acquisitions expenditure accounted for an outflow of $530 million compared with $1,243 million in 2004.  
This included $153 million in respect of the Group's investment in the Initial Public Offering of China 
Shenhua Energy Company Limited.
 Income from disposals totalled $677 million, with proceeds on the sale of Acerinox and Columbus of         
$173 million (with a further $21 million remitted by associates) and $445 million on the disposal of Boart 
and Wendt. Proceeds remitted by associates in respect of disposals included $83 million for the sale of 
Samancor Chrome.
 Repayment of loans and capital from associates amounted to $370 million.  Purchases of tangible fixed 
assets amounted to $3,306 million, an increase of $140 million.  Increased capital expenditure by 
AngloGold Ashanti, Coal and Ferrous Metals and Industries was partially offset by a reduction in capital 
expenditure at Platinum, Base Metals, Industrial Minerals and Paper and Packaging.

(1) Since the release of the Group's restated IFRS information on 9 May 2005, an additional deferred tax 
liability of $227 million (GBP126 million) has been           recognised on transition to IFRS in respect 
of underlying fair value adjustments.  This adjustment was taken to opening retained earnings in   
accordance with IFRS 1.
 Reconciliation of cash flows
 The material adjustments made to the presentation of the Group's consolidated cash flow statement were 
the inclusion of cash flows from joint venture entities on a line-by-line basis in accordance with 
proportionate consolidation rules set out in IAS 31; and the inclusion of short term cash investments 
maturing within 90 days of deposit previously disclosed as current asset investments as cash equivalents 
in accordance with IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements.
 Explanation of reconciling items between UK GAAP and IFRS
 The more significant areas of accounting change are:
 IAS 1 - Reclassification of UK GAAP minority interest within equity
 Minority interests were reclassified from long term liabilities to equity in accordance with IAS 1. 
Although this increased reported net assets by $4.6 billion at 31 December 2004 and $3.4 billion at 1 
January 2004, it has no impact on total shareholders' equity.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0039A -20-
 IAS 1 - Reclassification of unrealised gains
 The international accounting framework provides no distinction between unrealised and realised gains for 
financial reporting. As such, all unrealised gains, with the exception of actuarial gains or losses on 
post-retirement schemes and currency translation differences, are recorded through the income statement 
and not through the statement of total recognised gains and losses, as was required under UK GAAP.
 Although this reclassification has increased reported profit for the year to 31 December 2004 by $0.4 
billion, there is no change to net assets.
 12.   Reconciliation between UK GAAP and IFRS (continued)
 IAS 10 - Proposed dividend adjustment
 Dividends proposed are recognised in the period in which they are formally approved for payment. This is 
also in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (International Accounting Standards and Other Accounting 
Amendments) Regulations 2004, which is effective for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 
2005.
 The change in timing of recognising proposed dividends and the related tax thereon increased reported net 
assets of the Group as at 31 December 2004 by $815 million, being the final 2004 proposed dividends to the 
Group's shareholders and its minority interests and by $622 million as at 1 January 2004, being the final 
2003 proposed dividends.
 IAS 12 - Recognition of deferred tax on fair value adjustments
 Deferred tax is recognised at acquisition as part of the assessment of the fair value of assets and 
liabilities acquired and is provided on balances previously excluded from provision under UK GAAP such as 
revaluations of tangible fixed assets. The largest temporary difference requiring additional deferred tax 
provision on transition arose between the carrying value of mineral reserves and the respective tax base.
 Upon adoption of IFRS, the Group recognised a deferred tax liability of $1.7 billion in respect of 
additional temporary differences arising on previous acquisitions. In accordance with IFRS 1 the Group 
took the exemption from restating acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, and as such this adjustment was 
made to reserves at 1 January 2004. Deferred tax provided on temporary differences for acquisitions made 
after 1 January 2004 either increases the value attributed to mineral reserves or goodwill, depending on 
the nature of the temporary difference giving rise to it.
 Any deferred tax raised will unwind through the consolidated income statement as the underlying temporary 
difference is amortised. The net impact from the recognition of additional temporary differences on 
acquisitions was to increase profit after tax by $41 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
 IAS 19 - Defined benefit pension obligation
 IAS 19 requires companies to recognise the full deficit (or surplus, subject to restrictions) of post-
retirement benefits under defined benefit arrangements on the balance sheet. The Group adopted the 
amendment to IAS 19 and has recognised all actuarial gains or losses directly through equity.
 This accounting change reduced consolidated net assets by approximately $0.6 billion (net of deferred 
tax) as at 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2004, as the full actuarial gains and losses of defined benefit 
arrangements are now reflected in reserves. There is no material impact on net profit for the year ended 
31 December 2004.
 IAS 21 - Recycling of currency translation adjustment
 IAS 21 requires cumulative currency translation adjustments (CTA) arising on translation of a foreign 
operation to be recycled through the income statement when that entity is disposed of. Previously, under 
UK GAAP, the CTA was not included in the gain or loss calculated if that operation was sold. In accordance 
with IFRS 1, the Group took the exemption from recycling foreign currency gains or losses arising before 1 
January 2004.
 The accounting policy change increased reported profit on disposal of non US dollar operations by $30 
million for the year to 31 December 2004 which represented recycled CTA gains arising since 1 January 
2004.
 This accounting change had no impact on consolidated net assets, as it is effectively recycling gains and 
losses reported previously in reserves back through the income statement.
 IAS 21 - Translation of goodwill arising post 1 January 2004

 NOTES TO THE INTERIM ACCOUNTS
 1.   Accounting policies
 a)   Basis of preparation
 The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for interim financial statements.  These are the 
Group's first IFRS condensed consolidated interim financial statements for part of the period covered by 
the first IFRS annual financial statement and IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards has been applied.  The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not 
include all of the information required for full annual financial statements.
 An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported financial position and financial 
performance of the Group is provided in note 11.  The note includes reconciliations of equity and profit 
for comparative periods reported under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (UK GAAP) to those 
reported for those periods under IFRS.
 EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002) requires that the next annual consolidated financial statements of 
the company, for the year ending 31 December 2005, be prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted for use in the EU ("adopted IFRS").
 This interim financial information has been prepared on the basis of the recognition and measurement 
requirements of adopted IFRS as at 30 June 2005 that are effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 
December 2005, the Group's first annual reporting date at which it is required to use adopted IFRS.  Based 
on these adopted IFRS, the directors have applied the accounting policies, as set out in note 1, which 
they expect to apply when the first annual IFRS financial statements are prepared for the year ending 31 
December 2005.
 However, the adopted IFRSs that will be effective (or available for early adoption) in the annual 
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2005 are still subject to change and to additional 
interpretations and therefore cannot be determined with certainty.  Accordingly, the accounting policies 
for that annual period will be determined finally only when the annual financial statements are prepared 
for the year ending 31 December 2005.
 The interim accounts included in this financial information are not audited and do not constitute full 
statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 of the Companies Act 1985. The comparative figures 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 are not the Company's statutory accounts for that financial 
year.  Those accounts, which were prepared under UK GAAP, have been reported on by the Company's auditors 
and delivered to the registrar of companies. The report of the auditors was unqualified and did not 
contain statements under section 237(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 1985.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0066A -4-
 b)    Significant accounting policies
 The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the six months ended 30 June 
2005 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group") and the Group's 
interest in associates and jointly controlled entities.
 These accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group for the purposes of these 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
 c)     Accounting convention
 The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except that the following assets 
and liabilities are stated at fair value:
 -  derivative financial instruments
 -  hedged items.
 d)    Basis of consolidation
 The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings made up to 31 December each year.
 The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the 
consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
 The Group's investment in joint ventures and associates is accounted for using the equity method. 
Mansford Biotrace has a financial year of 31 March and therefore the amount included in the consolidated 
accounts is derived from management accounts.
 e)     Foreign currency transactions
 Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.  Foreign exchange differences 
arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction.
 f)     Financial statements of foreign operations.
 The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on consolidation, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.   
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the rates approximating the 
foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.  Foreign exchange differences arising on 
retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
 g)    Accounting for derivative financial instruments
 The Group uses forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange risks; it does not use these 
instruments for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value, with 
recognition of any gain or loss dependent on the nature of the item being hedged. Where derivatives do not 
qualify for hedge accounting, the gain or loss on measurement is recognised immediately in the profit or 
loss.

 In the news release, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) Initiates Clinical Trials to Explore Use of Humira (TM) 
(adalimumab) in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis, issued earlier today by Abbott Laboratories over PR Newswire, we 
are advised by the company that the entire sixteenth paragraph, starting with, "Abbott is also working with other 
regulatory agencies in countries..." and ending with, "Currently, HUMIRA has been made available via patient 
named basis programs or study protocols in Europe," was originally issued inadvertently.  The sixteenth paragraph 
should be completely omitted and replaced with the corrected, complete paragraph as follows:
 In January 2003, Abbott announced the initiation of the HUMIRA Medicare Assistance Program, which ensures 
that Medicare-eligible seniors in need of a biologic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis who do not have prescription 
drug coverage can receive HUMIRA at no cost until a Medicare prescription drug benefit is enacted.  Eligible 
seniors can receive HUMIRA directly from their health care provider, and access continues as long as they continue 
to meet the eligibility criteria.

 ABBOTT PARK, Ill., March 3, 2003 - Abbott Laboratories announced today the expansion of its immunology 
clinical trials program to include studies evaluating the potential of HUMIRA(TM) (adalimumab) in 
psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.  Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are autoimmune disorders in which a 
human protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), has been suggested to play a role in the disease 
development.
 Data from clinical studies suggest that treatments that inhibit TNF-a may be effective in these disease 
states. HUMIRA, which is a human monoclonal antibody that resembles antibodies normally found in the body, 
works by specifically blocking TNF-a.
 HUMIRA is the first human monoclonal antibody approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
reducing the signs and symptoms and inhibiting the progression of structural damage in adults with 
moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had insufficient response to one or more 
traditional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and can be used alone or in combination with 
methotrexate (MTX) or other DMARDs.  HUMIRA was created using phage display technology, resulting in an 
antibody with human-derived heavy and light chains variable regions and human IgG1:Kconstant regions.  The 
European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) accepted Abbott's submission for HUMIRA 
for the treatment of RA in April 2002, and approval is anticipated in mid-2003.
 "Abbott is committed to exploring the full therapeutic potential of HUMIRA," said Jim Lefkowith, M.D., 
divisional vice president, Immunosciences Development, Abbott Laboratories.  "Based on the recent approval 
of HUMIRA for rheumatoid arthritis, we're excited to be initiating programs that will help us understand 
the effect of HUMIRA in other autoimmune diseases as well."
 Psoriasis Trial
 HUMIRA will be studied in a randomized, multicenter, Phase II clinical trial that will assess safety and 
efficacy in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic-plaque psoriasis.  Patient response to 
treatment will be assessed by using the Psoriasis Area Severity Index score, which is a measure of a 
patient's disease activity.
 "We're hoping that this trial will lead to an available treatment option for the more than four million 
Americans living with psoriasis," said Ken Gordon, M.D., associate professor of medicine, division of 
dermatology, Loyola University Medical Center. "Psoriasis can have a significant emotional and 
psychological impact on a
 patient's quality of life and by investigating the use of HUMIRA in psoriasis, we're hoping to see 
improvements in treating the disease."
 Psoriasis is a non-contagious, chronic skin disease characterized by red plaques covered with white 
scales that presents in different forms and varying degrees of severity.   The most common form of 
psoriasis is "plaque psoriasis," which accounts for approximately 80 percent of psoriasis cases. Plaque 
psoriasis can appear on any skin surface, although the knees, elbows, scalp, and trunk are the most common 
locations.
 Psoriatic Arthritis Trial
 A Phase III study has been initiated that will evaluate HUMIRA in improving signs and symptoms of 
psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with moderate to severe disease.  Patients in the trial will be 
randomized to receive HUMIRA or placebo, and responses will be measured by improvements in signs and 
symptoms as measured by American College of Rheumatology response scores.

 "Psoriatic arthritis patients experience the often unmanageable symptoms of arthritis combined with 
psoriasis," said Philip Mease, M.D., clinical professor of rheumatology at the University of Washington.  
"This trial is designed to assess the effect of HUMIRA in the treatment of these patients and on the 
progression of the disease."
 Flares and remissions characterize the course of psoriatic arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease.  If 
left untreated it can be a progressively disabling disease.  The arthritic manifestations often include 
not only debilitating disease of the hands and feet as is seen in rheumatoid arthritis, but also arthritis 
of the spine and painful inflammation of tendon insertions.  Epidemiological studies indicate that 
psoriatic arthritis affects as many as 30 percent of the people who have psoriasis.  Common symptoms 
include varying degrees of psoriasis activity along with stiffness, pain, swelling and tenderness of the 
joints that can lead to a reduced range of motion and potential severe joint destruction.
 More information about HUMIRA clinical trials can be obtained by calling Abbott Medical Information at 1-
800-633-9110.
 Important Safety Information
 Cases of tuberculosis (TB), frequently disseminated or extra pulmonary at clinical presentation have been 
observed in patients receiving HUMIRA.  Serious infections and sepsis, including fatalities, have been 
reported with the use of TNF-blocking agents, including HUMIRA.  Many of these infections occurred in 
patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy that in addition to their underlying disease could 
predispose them to infections.  Other invasive opportunistic fungal infections have also been observed in 
patients treated with TNF-blocking agents, including HUMIRA.
 TNF-blocking agents, including HUMIRA, have been associated in rare cases with exacerbation of 
demyelinating disease.  The most frequent adverse events seen in the placebo-controlled clinical trials 
(HUMIRA vs. placebo) were upper respiratory infection (17 percent vs. 13 percent), injection site pain (12 
percent vs. 12 percent), headache (12 percent vs. 8 percent), rash (12 percent vs. 6 percent) and 
sinusitis         (11 percent vs. 9 percent).  Discontinuations due to adverse events were 7 percent for 
HUMIRA and 4 percent for placebo.  As with any treatment program, the benefits and risks of HUMIRA should 
be carefully considered before initiating therapy.
 About HUMIRA
 HUMIRA was discovered through a broad scientific collaboration between Abbott and Cambridge Antibody 
Technology (CAT).  As part of the collaboration, Abbott had the right to select several target antigens 
for which a joint Abbott/CAT research team would discover human antibody therapeutics.  HUMIRA was 
isolated and optimized by Abbott and CAT as part of this collaboration.  Abbott owns exclusive worldwide 
rights to HUMIRA, including responsibility for clinical development, manufacturing, sales and marketing.  
Abbott will book all revenues for HUMIRA, and CAT will receive a royalty fee based on HUMIRA sales.
 Additionally, clinical trials are currently underway evaluating the potential of HUMIRA in juvenile 
rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and Crohn's disease.
 Abbott's Commitment to Immunology
 Abbott Laboratories is committed to the discovery and development of innovative treatments for 
immunologic diseases.  Founded in 1989, the Abbott Bioresearch Center in Worcester, Mass., is a world-
class discovery and basic research facility committed to finding new treatments for autoimmune diseases.  
Abbott Bioresearch Center employs leading-edge technologies, discovery and manufacturing processes, 
including proprietary phage antibody display technology, and mammalian cell expression systems to produce 
fully human monoclonal antibodies.
 In January 2003, Abbott announced the initiation of the HUMIRA Medicare Assistance Program, which ensures 
that Medicare-eligible seniors in need of a biologic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis who do not have 
prescription drug coverage can receive HUMIRA at no cost until a Medicare prescription drug benefit is 
enacted.  Eligible seniors can receive HUMIRA directly from their health care provider, and access 
continues as long as they continue to meet the eligibility criteria.
 More information about Abbott Immunology and HUMIRA, including full prescribing information, is available 
on the Web sites, www.abbottimmunology.com and            www.HUMIRA.com.  Prescribing information is also 
available by calling Abbott Medical Information at 1-800-633-9110.

 Forward Looking Information
 Certain statements contained in this transition report, including any targets, forecasts, projections 
descriptions of anticipated cost savings, statements regarding the possible development or possible 
assumed future results of operations, any statement preceded by, followed by or that includes the words 
"believes", "expects", "aims", "intends", "will", "may", "anticipates" or similar expressions or negatives 
thereof, and other statements that are not historical facts, are or may constitute forward looking 
statements (as such term is defined in the U.S. Private Securities Reform litigation Act of 1995). Because 
such statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially 
from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include 
but are not limited to risks and uncertainties relating to profitability targets, prevailing interest 
rates, the performance of the Irish and UK economies and the international capital markets, the Group's 
ability to expand certain of its activities, competition, regulatory developments, our ability to achieve 
the estimated benefits under the transformation programme, the Group's ability to address information 
technology issues and the availability of funding sources and other risks and uncertainties in this 
document. The Group does not undertake to release publicly any revision or update to these forward-looking 
statements to reflect events, circumstances or unanticipated events occurring after the date hereof.
 1.      Introduction
 Up to 31 March 2005 the Bank of Ireland Group ("the Group") prepared its Report and Accounts in 
accordance with Irish Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (IR GAAP). From 1 January 2005 all listed 
companies in the EU are required to produce consolidated financial statements prepared under IFRS. The 
Group has fully implemented IFRS from 1 April 2005 and will produce its first full IFRS financial 
statements for the year ending 31 March 2006.
 As a first time adopter the Report and Accounts will be produced in accordance with the transition 
arrangements detailed in IFRS 1. This requires the Group to apply all IFRSs in existence on the Group's 
first reporting date, 31 March 2006, and restate the comparative period with certain limited exceptions.  
This means that the Group will restate the March 2005 results (opening equity, profit and loss account and 
balance sheet) to comply with all existing IFRS. This report summarises the comparative information and 
reconciles it back to previously published Irish GAAP.  While the introduction of IFRS in itself does not 
change the economics, risks or cash flows of the business it does however, change how they are translated 
through the income statement and balance sheet.
 Companies are not required to restate comparatives for IFRS 4 (Insurance Contracts), IASs 32 (Financial 
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation) and 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) in 
their first set of IFRS Report and Accounts. In opting for this exemption the Group will apply Irish GAAP 
to insurance accounting, hedge accounting, loan loss accounting, effective interest rate and accounting 
for investments for the March 2005 comparative period.
 Also included in the report are provisional accounting policies to be used as the basis for the 
preparation of the full and half-year financial statements. These policies are prepared in accordance with 
all standards endorsed or expected to be endorsed by the EU and with all extant accounting standards and 
interpretations issued by the IASB, hereafter referred to as IFRS. However, existing standards may change 
or new standards or interpretations may be issued that may be applicable to the Report and Accounts for 
March 2006. Alternatively market practice may develop with regard to the interpretation and application of 
the existing standards. Either of these events may require us to alter the accounting policies used in the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0052A
preparation of this document and, as a result, the financial information presented could be subject to 
change.
 2.0    Overview
 The Group will apply IFRS in its Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2006.  Although the move 
to IFRS changes the timing of earnings recognition, it is important to note that there is no IFRS impact 
on business fundamentals, cash flows, the development of our growth strategies or the group capital 
management policies.  The implementation of IFRS may result in greater volatility in future periods and 
the group will endeavour to report business performance on a comparable basis with trends clearly 
identified on an ongoing basis.
 2.1    Financial Highlights
 The IR GAAP results to 31 March 2005 and 30 September 2004 have been restated to take account of 
International Financial Reporting Standards implemented with effect from the 1(st) April 2004. The changes 
to earnings mainly reflect the accounting treatment of goodwill, leasing, employee share option schemes, 
pension costs and certain aspects relating to the Group's life and pensions business, principally 
consolidating our life assurance business and grossing up the pre-tax embedded value profits for policy-
holders tax paid on long term assurance contracts, with a corresponding increase to the tax charge.
 The restatement of these results for 31 March 2005, and 30 September 2004, excludes adjustments for 
standards implemented with effect from 1 April 2005:-  IAS32, IAS39 and IFRS4.  Had these standards been 
implemented in the year to 31 March 2005 and the half year 30 September 2004 it would have impacted the 
accounting for derivatives, loan impairment, income recognition on loans, insurance accounting and 
classification of financial instruments.  Set out below are the IFRS proforma impacts of income 
recognition on loans, insurance accounting and classification of financial instruments in order to 
establish a proforma IFRS restatement for the year to 31 March 2005 and the half year at September 2004.  
Changes to accounting for derivatives and loan impairment under IAS39 are not included in the proforma 
restatement.

The group makes annual interest payments for derivative financial instruments and borrowings.  Further 
details are provided in notes 24 and 25.
 Sensitivity analysis
 The group holds financial assets and liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk.  An increase in 
100 basis points in interest yields, with all other variables constant, would result in a loss of capital 
on debt securities and a change in value of borrowings and derivative financial instruments.  This will 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0014A -15-
decrease pre-tax profits for the period by an estimated GBP10.7m (2005: GBP4.2m) and net assets would have 
decreased by an estimated GBP7.5m (2005: GBP2.5m).
 Price risk
 The equity securities and hedge funds that are recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value are 
susceptible to losses due to adverse changes in prices.  This is referred to as price risk.
 Investments are made in equity and hedge funds depending on the group's appetite for risk. These 
investments are well diversified with high quality, liquid securities.  The investment committee has 
established guidelines with investment managers setting out maximum investment limits, diversification 
across industries and concentrations in any one industry or company.
 Listed investments are recognised on the balance sheet at quoted bid price.  If the market for the 
investment is not considered to be active, then the group has established fair value using valuation 
techniques.  This includes using recent arm's length market transactions, reference to current fair value 
of other investments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow models and other valuation 
techniques that are commonly used by market participants.  The total change in fair value using these 
valuation techniques that was recognised in the income statement during the year is GBP1.8m (2005: 
GBP4.1m).
 Sensitivity analysis
 At 31 December 2006, the fair value of hedge funds recognised on the balance sheet was GBP50.3m (2005: 
GBP42.5m).  If the fair value of the group's hedge fund portfolio were to fall by 10%, then the overall 
pre-tax impact on net assets would be a decline of GBP5.0m (2005: GBP4.3m).
 At 31 December 2006, the fair value of equities recognised on the balance sheet was GBP40.7m (2005: 
GBP4.5m). These equities are listed on various global stock exchanges and a 10% fall in the global equity 
market will result in a pre-tax impact on net assets of GBP4.1m (2005: GBP0.5m).
 2.5 Operational risk
 Operational risk arises from the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, 
people and systems or from external events.
 The group actively manages these risks and minimises them where appropriate.  This is achieved by 
implementing and communicating guidelines to staff and other third parties.  The group also regularly 
monitors the performance of its controls and adherence to these guidelines through the risk management 
reporting process.
 Key components of the group control environment include:
 -  ICA modelling of operational risk exposure and scenario testing;
 -  Management review of activities;
 -  Documentation of policies and procedures;
 -  Contingency planning; and
 -  Other systems controls.
 2.6 Group risk
 Group risk occurs where business units fail to consider the impact of their activities on other parts of 
the group, as well as the risks arising from these activities. There are three main components of group 
risk which are explained below.
 Strategic
 This is the risk that the group's strategy is inappropriate or that the group is unable to implement its 
strategy. There is no tolerance for any breach of guidance issued by the board, and where events supersede 
the group strategic plan this is escalated at the earliest opportunity through the group's monitoring 
tools and governance structure.
 Reputation
 Reputation risk is the risk of negative publicity as a result of the group's contractual arrangements, 
customers, products and services.  Key sources of reputation risk include operation of a Lloyd's 
franchise, interaction with capital markets since the group's IPO during 2002, and reliance upon the 
Beazley brand in the US, Europe and Asia.  The group's preference is to minimise reputation risks.  Where 
it is not possible to avoid all events which can result in reputation risks, the group seeks to minimise 
their frequency and severity by managing these topics through public relations and communication channels.
 Management stretch
 Management stretch is the risk that business growth might cause the group's matrix management structure 
to become overly complex, and undermine accountability and control within the group.  As the group expands 
its worldwide business in the US, Europe and Asia, management stretch may make the identification, 
analysis and control of group risks more complex.
 On a day-to-day basis, operation of the matrix management structure encourages organisational flexibility 
and adaptability, while ensuring that activities are appropriately coordinated and controlled.  By 
focusing on the needs of their customers and demonstrating both progressive and responsive abilities, 
staff, management and outsourced service providers are expected to excel in service and quality.  
Individuals and teams are also expected to transact their activities in an open and transparent way.  
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0014A -15-
These behavioural expectations reaffirm low group risk tolerance by aligning interests to ensure that 
routine activities, projects and other initiatives are implemented to benefit and protect both local and 
group resources.
 Capital management
 The group has two requirements for capital that it complied with during the year:
 --      To support underwriting at Lloyd's through syndicate 2623.  This is based on the group's own 
individual capital adequacy (ICA); and
 --      To support it's underwriting in BICI in the US.

 ICA
 We use stochastic modelling techniques to regularly assess our ICA for our Lloyd's underwriting operations. 
Through detailed measurement of risk exposures, we allocate capital to support business activities according to risk 
profile.  Stress and scenario analysis is performed and the results are documented and reconciled to the board's 
risk appetite.

 risk type     to group
 ------------  -----------  --------------------------------------------------------
 Insurance     Dominant     This is the largest risk we face as our primary
 business is to accept insurance and reinsurance
 risk by means of appropriate premiums to cover
 claims and operational costs, and to maximise
 the expected return on regulatory capital.
Credit        Material     Both brokers and reinsurers are of good quality.
Liquidity     Low          This risk is low because the group's assets are
 liquid and short term.
Market        Material     Group assets are high quality, well diversified
 and short term.
Operational   Low          Our allocation of capital to these risks is cautious
 and is based on a set of worst case defined scenarios.
Group         Low          This risk is low, but may increase with growth
 of the US operation.
Insurance risk is our biggest risk, and includes both catastrophe and non-catastrophe exposures.  To manage these 
exposures we model aggregate risks and the likely financial impact to the group for defined events.

1.3  IFRS from 1 January 2005
 Impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39
 BG Group will adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005.  These standards set out the accounting rules 
surrounding the recognition, measurement, disclosure and presentation of financial instruments.  BG 
Group's accounting policies under IAS 32 and IAS 39 will not be impacted by the elements carved out of the 
EU endorsement, and hence will comply in full with IAS 39.
 Most of BG Group's contracts for the sale and purchase of commodities are considered 'own use' contracts 
that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery in accordance with 
BG Group's expected sale, purchase or usage requirements. However, under IAS 39 BG Group is also required 
to assess own use contracts to determine whether they contain embedded derivatives.  This assessment was 
made based upon conditions at the inception of the contracts.
 Net assets as at 1 January 2005 will reduce by GBP238m on implementation of IAS 39.  The large majority 
of this reduction (GBP225m) relates to the recognition of certain long-term UK gas contracts at fair value 
(see below). The loss on these contracts arises as they are required to be marked to market and current UK 
market gas prices are considerably higher than prices under contract terms agreed in prior years.  The 
underlying contracts are profitable on an operational basis and there is no impact on cash flow from the 
accounting change.
 The most significant expected impacts of adopting these standards are set out below:
 --    Certain long-term contracts for the sale of gas to the UK gas market fall within the scope of IAS 
39. Whilst the activity surrounding these contracts involves the physical delivery of gas, the contracts 
fall within the scope of IAS 39 as they are considered to contain written options relating to buyer 
flexibility e.g. with respect to volumes purchased.  Accordingly, they will be marked-to-market in their 
entirety with movements in this mark-to-market valuation recognised in the income statement.
 --    Asset optimisation activities undertaken by BG Group's UK and US operations involve short-term 
contracts for the sale and purchase of commodities and associated derivative instruments.  These 
instruments fall within the scope of IAS 39 and will be marked-to-market with movements in this mark-to-
market valuation recognised in the income statement.
 --    BG Group's gas marketing business in the US uses derivative instruments to manage margin exposure 
arising from fluctuations in gas prices.  Cash flow hedge accounting will be applied where derivative 
instruments are designated as a hedge of probable future gas sales.  Gains and losses associated with 
those derivatives determined to be effective hedges will be deferred in equity until the underlying 
transaction affects the income statement.
 --    Financial instruments utilised by BG Group's treasury operations include interest rate swaps, 
foreign currency swaps, forward rate agreements, interest rate swaptions, tax equalisation swaps and 
forward exchange contracts.  These financial instruments are used to manage the Group's exposure to 
foreign exchange and interest rate movements. Certain derivative instruments are designated as fair value 
hedges of interest rate risk associated with the long-term debt of the Group and hedge the foreign 
exchange movements associated with the Group's net investments in foreign operations. The fair value of 
these derivative instruments will be recognised on the balance sheet.  Movements in fair value will be 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0061A -5-
recognised in income to the extent they relate to hedges of the risks associated with Group debt, or in 
equity when relating to effective hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
 --    Long-term issued debt of the Group will be recorded at amortised cost except where the debt is part 
of a fair value hedge relationship when the carrying value of the debt will be adjusted to reflect fair 
value movements associated with the hedged risks throughout the effective period of the hedge. These fair 
value movements will be recognised in income and offset against movements in the related hedging 
instrument.
 Impact of IFRIC 3
 In December 2004 the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued IFRIC 3 
Emission Rights.  It is effective for periods commencing from 1 March 2005.  BG Group intends to adopt 
IFRIC 3 during 2005, once allowances to be allocated under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme have been 
finalised.
 The adoption of IFRIC 3 will result in the balance sheet recognition of an intangible asset for the 
allowances held and a government grant when these have been allocated at below fair value.  In addition, a 
liability will be recognised (at fair value) in respect of the obligation to deliver allowances to match 
against emissions made.  The fair values for assets and liabilities recognised will be based upon the 
market prices for emissions allowances.  At current market values, the impact of IFRIC 3 is not forecast 
to be material to BG Group's business.
 Impact of IFRIC 4
 IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement contains a Lease was issued by IFRIC in December 2004.  It is 
effective for periods commencing from 1 January 2006 and comparative period restatement is required.  BG 
Group is currently reviewing the impact of this interpretation.  One likely impact is the classification 
of the Lake Charles regasification capacity contracts as finance leases.
 Impact of IFRS 6
 In December 2004 the IASB issued IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.  The 
standard was issued to make limited improvements to accounting practices for exploration and evaluation 
expenditure in advance of a comprehensive review of accounting for extractive industries planned by the 
IASB.
 Under IFRS 6 companies can continue to use accounting policies applied before adopting the standard. 
Accordingly, BG Group will continue to use the successful efforts basis of accounting for exploration 
activity as defined by the UK SORP.  In addition, IFRS 6 requires impairment testing to be performed on 
exploration and evaluation assets when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying values may exceed 
their recoverable amounts.  This is consistent with BG Group's current approach.
 The effective date for the standard is 1 January 2006.  BG Group does not consider that adoption of this 
standard will have a significant impact on the results of the Group.
 1.4       Presentation of results under IFRS
 In order to provide users of BG Group's accounts with information under IFRS that is readily understood 
in the context of information previously available under UK GAAP reporting, BG Group will highlight the 
following information in its quarterly income statements:

 Commenting on the results, Michael A.J. Farrell, said:
 "This quarter has been a demanding one for all companies exposed to the US financial markets, as the 
Federal Reserve has continued to raise short term interest rates while long term rates have remained 
largely unchanged. Despite the flattening yield curve, Prodesse has managed to deliver on its objectives 
since its IPO in April 2005.  As the portfolio is rebalanced into new interest rate environments, we 
expect our barbell approach to produce significant returns for Prodesse shareholders."

 Prodesse reported net income for the quarter ended 30 September 2005 of US$5.1 million (period ended 30 
June 2005 : US$5.8 million) or US$0.18 net income per share (period ended 30 June 2005 : US$0.21).  Net 
income and yields stated in this press release do not include net unrealised losses on investments.  Net 
unrealised losses are reflected in the equity in accordance with the accounting policies.
 The Company delivered an annualized return on average equity (RoAE) of 7.72% for the quarter ended 30

The Company commenced operations on 8 April 2005 and for the period from commencement of operations 
through 30 September 2005, the annualized return on average equity was 8.71%.
 Portfolio Performance
 For the quarter ended 30 September 2005, the annualized yield on average earning assets was 4.23% (period 
ended 30 June 2005 : 4.01%) and the annualized cost of funds on the average repurchase balance was 3.57% 
(period ended 30 June 2005 : 2.67%), which equates to an interest rate spread of 66 basis points (period ended 30 
June 2005 : 134 basis points).  This is a 68 basis point decrease over the interest rate spread for the period ended 
30 June 2005.
 The Constant Prepayment Rate, or CPR, on the Company's mortgage-backed securities portfolio averaged 23% 
for the quarter ended 30 September 2005 (period ended 30 June 2005 : 20%).  Prepayment speeds on mortgage-
backed securities, as reflected by the CPR vary according to the type of investment, changes in interest rates, 
conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. 
In general, as prepayment speeds on the Company's mortgage-backed securities portfolio increase, related 
purchase premium amortization increases, thereby reducing the net yield on such assets.

Income statement
 Gross rental income was 11% lower resulting from the significant level of asset sales over this period and last year.  
Since the disposals mainly affected the British Land Group rather than its interests in Funds and Joint Ventures the 
overall reduction in gross rental income between the two half year periods was only 6% on a proportionally 
consolidated basis, to GBP353 million.  On a like for like basis (including our share of Funds and Joint Ventures) -

that is excluding purchases, sales, developments and adjusting for asset management initiatives - growth in rental 
income was 3%, reflecting 1.8% for offices and 3.8% for retail properties.
 Fees and other income amounted to GBP33 million for the six month period (2005: GBP9 million) which includes a 
dividend received from Songbird Estates plc (Canary Wharf) of GBP18 million (2005: GBPnil) and performance and 
management fees of GBP11 million (2005: GBP2 million).
 Administrative expenses for the six months amounted to GBP42 million compared to GBP36 million in the prior 
period and included a full six months of administrative expenses, specifically staff costs, relating to the acquisition of 
Pillar Property plc in July 2005.
 Net interest costs reduced substantially following repayment of debt from the proceeds of sales and the impact of 
cheaper debt raised on refinancing, to GBP157 million for the six months (down 17%) and GBP188 million on a 
proportionally consolidated basis (down 14%), excluding the charge of GBP228 million pre-tax incurred on the 
British Land debenture refinancing (set out below).
 Underlying pre-tax profit, excluding the refinancing charge, was up 27% to GBP130 million, benefiting from receipt 
of the Songbird dividend in the first quarter, growth in underlying rents, lower finance charges as a result of 
refinancing activity and the disposals, which reduced interest costs by more than the rental income foregone.
 British Land's share of underlying pre-tax profit of Funds and Joint Ventures was GBP22 million (2005: GBP14 
million).  Including valuation gains, goodwill and taxation, Funds and Joint Ventures contributed GBP155 million 
(2005: GBP80 million) on an after tax basis.
 The tax rate for the six months is 18% with an underlying rate of 20%, excluding the refinancing charge, tax on 
sales and the effects of prior year items.
 Earnings per share were also affected by the refinancing charge; excluding this charge, earnings per share, 
reported at 111 pence, would have been 141 pence.  Underlying earnings per share were up 33% to 20 pence.
 The revaluation gains on property recognised in income totalled GBP643 million (2005: GBP578 million) including 
gains on property disposals of GBP36 million (2005: GBP34 million).  In addition the share of profits from capital 
items in Funds and Joint Ventures totalled GBP167 million (2005: GBP82 million) and a further GBP112 million 
(2005: GBP35 million) is shown within movements in equity relating to the revaluation of investments and 
development properties.  In total on a proportional consolidation basis, capital revaluation gains in relation to 
properties and investments amounted to GBP922 million for the period (2005: GBP695 million).
 Capital growth
 The combination of growth in the property portfolio of 6.2% and increased profits, less the refinancing charge, have 
led to an increase in EPRA net assets in the six months since March 2006 of 9% to 1624 pence per share. EPRA 
net assets without the refinancing charge, which amounted to 30 pence per share, would have been 1654 per 
share, an uplift of 11% in the six months.
 Total return (NAV growth plus dividends) for the six month period was 12%, before the debenture refinancing 
charge.
 Financial implications of REIT status
 As discussed earlier, British Land expects to elect REIT status from 1 January 2007.  On conversion to a REIT the 
entry charge will be treated as an expense in the period it is committed.  At the same time there will be a release of 
provisions made for deferred tax to the extent that gains on future disposals are expected to be tax exempt.  Based 
on 30 September 2006 values and assuming a target group structure that includes corporate joint ventures, the 
entry charge would be GBP315 million and the deferred tax release would be GBP1.7 billion.  The assumptions 
underlying this can be found on our website (Interim Results Presentation).
 The entry charge expense will reduce NAV per share.  The release of deferred tax will not increase NAV because 
deferred tax is excluded from that calculation.  The overall pro forma effect on NAV (based on 30 September 2006 
values) will be a reduction of 67 pence.

Group net interest income increased 3% (GBP105m) to GBP3,341m (2003: GBP3,236m), reflecting growth in 
balances which more than offset a 10 basis points fall in the Group net interest margin to 2.56%.  The Group net 
interest margin versus the second half of 2003 was stable.
 The Group net interest margin of 2.56% (2003: 2.66%) includes 0.45% (2003: 0.50%) arising from the benefit of 
free funds.  A component of the benefit of free funds is the structural hedge against short-term interest rate 
movements.  As expected, the contribution of the structural hedge has decreased to 0.16% (2003: 0.21%) largely 
due to the impact of higher short term interest rates.
 Group average interest earning assets increased GBP17bn to GBP261bn (2003: GBP244bn).  Domestic average 
interest earning assets increased GBP15bn to GBP173bn (2003: GBP158bn).  This reflected an increase of 
GBP9bn in Barclays Capital and a GBP5bn increase in UK Banking. International average interest earning assets 
increased GBP2bn to GBP88bn (2003: GBP86bn), primarily attributable to the inclusion of Banco Zaragozano.
 The domestic net interest margin fell 24 basis points to 3.43% (2003: 3.67%), with a significant majority of the 
move attributable to the increased proportion of wholesale assets in the domestic balance sheet and the impact of 
the structural hedge.  The remainder reflected increased margins in retail savings and UK Business Banking 
lending, which were broadly offset by a decline in mortgage and credit card margins as a result of interest rate rises.
 The international net interest margin improved by 5 basis points to 0.85% (2003: 0.80%) largely due to a change in 
the mix, in particular in the Barclays Capital portfolio.
 The Group net interest margin was impacted by the factors described above with the reduction partially mitigated 
by an increase in the proportion of domestic interest earning assets.

 higher value added services including banking was rewarded with a substantial increase in margins.  Overall, asset 
management net revenue margins increased from 44 basis points to 46 basis points.
 Costs
 While the performance of underlying asset management profits may look unexciting (GBP81.0 million, +5.2 per 
cent.), this improvement was achieved in a year in which average equity market levels were down on 2002, so that, 
despite gross margin improvements, net revenues declined by GBP22.6 million.  This decline was almost entirely 
offset by the year-on-year reduction in underlying costs of GBP20.5 million (-5.6 per cent.).  At the Group level this 
effect was even more dramatic: the improvement in Group pre-tax profits from GBP18.9 million to GBP65.6 million 
was primarily driven by the elimination of GBP63.9 million (13.6 per cent.) from the Group's 2002 operating cost 
base.  Lower headcount, efficiency gains and falling project and redundancy costs all contributed to this cost 
reduction, which was achieved despite a GBP10.6 million increase in the cost of pension contributions in the year.
 Earnings Momentum
 Schroders went into 2003 with net revenue margins (2002 asset management net revenue divided by 2002 
average FUM) on its fund management business of 44 basis points and current cost margins (2002 underlying 
asset management costs divided by 2003 opening funds under management) of 42 basis points, giving an 
estimated net margin of 2 basis points.  By the end of the year, as we have already noted, revenue margins had 
risen to 46 basis points.  More importantly, the 2004 opening current cost margins, calculated on the same basis, 
stood at 35 basis points.  This would suggest that we start 2004 with a net margin of 11 basis points. Whilst these 
measures of current operating margins are somewhat crude, the size and direction of the change in the net margins 
between the beginning of 2003 and the beginning of 2004 illustrate the very positive impact on profitability of rising 
markets and tight cost control.
 Market Trends and Related Risks
 In Spring 2003, equity markets reached their lowest point since the start of the bear market in 2000, driven by 
geopolitical and economic concerns.  While the global political picture has improved less than might have been 
hoped since the conclusion of the Iraq war, the economic environment has undoubtedly strengthened and this has 
fed through into the fund management sector in the form of higher profits and changing strategic asset allocation.

Equally, whatever the level of markets in the short term, underlying momentum behind the sector remains strong, 
with gaps in existing pensions provision and positive demographic factors promising a continued focus on 
stimulating savings over the coming years.
 Schroders retains a relatively high level of operational gearing and profits would clearly be exposed in the short 
term to a decline in equity markets from their current levels.  Market related risks have become more manageable in 
the light of the reduction in costs and increase in margins over the last two years. Retaining the cost disciplines 
acquired during this period as the market moves into a more expansionary phase presents a further challenge and 
requires a strong alignment between the interests of staff and shareholders.  Schroders has considerably increased 
the proportion of total staff compensation delivered in the form of equity over the last three years and we rely on this 
and other measures to maintain an appropriate focus on profitability, particularly at a senior level.
 We believe that our remuneration policies mitigate the inevitable risks in the current more robust recruitment 
environment, and will help us to retain our key staff.
 While the economic background has been favourable for fund managers over the last 12 months, the regulatory 
and legal environment in which we operate has become more complex.  The impact on Schroders of the market 
timing scandals in the US mutual fund industry has been very limited to date, but the potential consequences for the 
industry in the longer term are hard to predict. If the regulatory environment is tightened disproportionately in 
response, the costs of doing business are bound to rise.  The same, broadly speaking, applies to the debate about 
the softing and unbundling of equity trading and research commissions, where we await further developments.  Our 
overriding concern is that any new regulation should be appropriate and maintain a level playing field between 
market participants.

 Shareholders' funds at 31(st) December 2003 were GBP1.04 billion.
 The table above sets out management's view of the allocation of capital between the different activities in the 
Group.  On the basis of this analysis, the Group's holding companies have some GBP682 million of surplus capital 
available to fund acquisitions or investment opportunities.  Liquid funds are invested in cash, bank deposits or 
segregated money market and bond portfolios.  With the exception of private equity, the great majority of surplus 
capital is held directly in sterling instruments or hedged back into sterling.
 Schroders carries no significant borrowings on the balance sheet and working capital requirements are largely 
confined to the maintenance of regulatory capital and the funding of fee receivables billed in arrears.
 Cash Flows
 A significant proportion of the cash flows reflected in the financial statements relate to the private banking 
businesses.  Stripping these out leaves two significant non-operating items: (i) cash inflows during the year relating 
to net interest received (GBP25.5 million); and (ii) cash outflows relating to payment of dividends (GBP53.4 million).

net revenues ratio, 83 per cent. (2002: 84 per cent.); net revenues on average funds under management, 46 basis 
points (2002: 44 basis points) and underlying costs on average funds under management, 39 basis points (2002: 37

 Footnotes to the quarterly report ended 30 September 2005
 1.   Organisation and Investment Objective
 Prodesse Investment Limited is a limited liability Guernsey-incorporated closed-end investment company, 
the investments of which are managed by Fixed Income Discount Advisory Company ("the Investment Manager").  
The Company's share capital structure consists solely of Ordinary Shares.  The Company has a listing on 
the London Stock Exchange and a listing on the Channel Islands Stock Exchange.  The Company will have an 
indefinite life but Shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on its continuation at the Annual 
General Meeting to be held in 2010.
 The Company invests in a portfolio consisting primarily of AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities on a 
leveraged basis.  The Company's investment strategy is to generate net income for distribution from the 
spread between the interest income from the portfolio and the cost of borrowing pursuant to reverse 
repurchase agreements used to finance the portfolio.  The Investment Manager will seek to enhance returns 
through what it considers an appropriate amount of leverage.

 2005 was a strong year for Venture demonstrating the benefits of the capital investment over the previous two 
years, resulting in record production, cashflow and profits.  Unit lifting costs have fallen by 27% with increased 
production and reserves.  This increase in reserves has been from further acquisitions and field development 
programmes, which has led to a replacement ratio of over 400%.  In parallel with this, 2005 has seen the biggest 
change in accounting regulations since the introduction of UK GAAP with the first time implementation of IFRS.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0067A -6-
 Revenue of GBP164.1 million for the twelve months ended 31 December 2005 (2004: GBP81.5 million) was 101% 
higher than that achieved in the same period in 2004. This reflects a 77% increase in production to 29,864 boepd 
(2004: 16,832 boepd) and the benefit of higher commodity prices.  The operating profit of GBP73.5 million was 
depressed by GBP9.5 million due to the adoption of IFRS, offset by lower unit lifting costs.  On a like-for-like basis 
an underlying operating profit of GBP83.0 million was generated in 2005 (2004: GBP23.1million) with an underlying 
fully- diluted EPS of 36.1 pence (2004: loss 5.0 pence).  Profit before tax of GBP55.9 million (2004: loss GBP0.3 
million) was further depressed by a GBP6.5 million mark to market hedging cost as a result of IAS 39 giving an 
underlying profit before tax of GBP71.9 million.  No adjustment in respect of IFRS has any cash impact.
 Operating cashflow for 2005 was GBP77.7 million (2004: GBP44.1 million), an increase of 76%.
 The adoption of IFRS has a material impact on both the Balance Sheet and Income Statement.  For this reason, 
there are two sections of commentary on the Income Statement.  Firstly, a commentary on the underlying profit

2005 was a successful year for Venture with underlying Operating Profit increasing to GBP83.0 million 
(2004: GBP5.0 million).  Venture achieved an average realised price of GBP17.35/boe, an increase of 22% 
over 2004, reflecting the higher commodity prices offset by the production volumes hedged at prices below 
market levels. The ability to fully benefit from the higher commodity prices was restricted by two 
incidents.  Firstly, the loss of 'Trees' production due to the Brae riser leak until 4 February and 
secondly, 14 days lost gas production from 'A' Fields due to a shutdown of LOGGS.  An insurance claim of 
GBP10 million was received relating to the Brae Riser incident, of which GBP6.5 million was for lost 
revenue and GBP3.5 million was for costs.
 Gas accounted for 64% of production and 68% of revenues, whilst oil represented 36% of production and 32% 
of revenues.  The increased proportion of gas reflects the contribution of the Annabel project, Saturn 
coming on stream and the loss of production from 'Trees'.
 As a result of increased production volumes across Venture's three production hubs, unit lifting costs 
have decreased by 27% from GBP6.59/boe to GBP4.80/boe.  This is in line with expectations and demonstrates 
the benefit of increased production volumes through the fixed cost infrastructure.
 The unit rate for depreciation, depletion and amortisation ('DD&A') has increased from GBP2.33/boe in 
2004 to GBP3.71/boe in 2005.  This reflects the cost of acquiring and developing Venture's asset 
portfolio.
 Underlying Gross Profit increased by GBP80.3 million to GBP82.2 million (2004: GBP1.9 million).  Gross 
Profit for 2004 included a non-cash impairment of the Company's Trinidadian assets of GBP18.1 million 
following the strategic decision to withdraw from operations in that country.
 Administration expenses excluding IFRS adjustments for the year were GBP4.9 million (2004: GBP2.8 
million).  On a unit basis, administration expenses of GBP0.45/boe remained at the same level as 2004.
 Other Operating Income includes a receipt of GBP6.5 million in settlement of the business interruption 
element of the insurance claim for the Brae incident.
 Finance expense for the period totalled GBP12.6 million (2004: GBP5.8 million), an increase of GBP6.8 
million. The increase in bank interest reflects the higher utilisation of the bank facility, from 
borrowings of GBP64.5 million at 31 December 2004 to GBP172.7 million at 31 December 2005.  Asset 
acquisitions and the capital development programme have driven this increase in borrowings.  The 2005 
charge also includes GBP1.5 million for the write off of bank facility fees relating to the previous 
financing that had been capitalized.  Non-cash finance expense on future decommissioning liabilities has 
increased by GBP0.9 million to a total of GBP3.8 million, following Gadwall and Annabel fields coming on 
stream.  These increases have been partially offset by a GBP3.1 million credit derived from the 
capitalisation of interest on development projects.
 The effective tax rate for 2005 was 44% compared with 96% in 2004, and is deferred as a result of 
Venture's tax position.  The deferred tax liability in the Balance Sheet is GBP46.9 million (2004: GBP39.5 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0067A -6-
million).  Due to brought forward losses, Venture is currently not in a tax paying position, although tax 
payments are expected to commence during 2007.
 On 19 December 2005 the sale of the Trinidadian operation was completed.  The total consideration of 
GBP18.0 million comprised cash GBP7.6 million, convertible loan notes GBP5.8 million and share capital 
GBP4.6 million. The gain on disposal of GBP0.4 million was in line with expectation following the 
impairment in 2004.
 Underlying Profit after tax was GBP40.0 million compared with GBP12.6 million for 2004 excluding the 
Trinidad impairment, an increase of 217%.
 Impact of IFRS
 There are a number of new Accounting Standards applicable to these statements, which Venture has reviewed 
fully.   Of these, there are three standards that have a major bearing on these annual accounts.
 IFRS 2  - Share-Based Payment
 IAS 12  - Income Taxes

 Major new trial shows CardioQ(TM) reducing duration of
 hospital stays by one third
 31 August 2006 Deltex Medical Group plc ('Deltex Medical' or the 'Company'), the UK's leading 
haemodynamic monitoring company, announces the publication today, in the British Journal of Surgery, of 
the results of a major new clinical trial using its CardioQ oesophageal Doppler monitors.
 The study conducted at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle demonstrated that in cases where doctors used 
Deltex Medical's CardioQ treatment during surgery to help better maintain fluid balance and blood 
circulation, those patients suffered fewer complications and were fit for discharge three days sooner than 
those who did not receive the treatment.
 Specifically, the study's main findings showed that patients using CardioQ:
 --      Were fit for discharge three days sooner (6 days versus 9 days);
 --      Were actually discharged from hospital two days sooner (7 days versus 9 days);
 --      Suffered significantly fewer post-operative complications (2% of patients versus 15%);
 --      Did not require unplanned intensive care (0% versus 11% of patients in the control group); and
 --      Tolerated food significantly earlier (2 days versus 4 days after surgery).
 The double-blinded prospective randomised controlled trial followed 108 patients undergoing bowel 
surgery. Patients being treated under the guidance of the CardioQ monitor were, on average, fit for 
discharge after six days and actually discharged after seven days. Patients where the CardioQ was not used 
were, on average, fit for discharge after nine days, three days longer.  They were actually discharged 
after nine days, two days longer.
 Comparison between today's study and recent NHS data on outcome following major bowel surgery shows that 
the average length of stay for patients treated at the Freeman Hospital using the CardioQ is almost half 
that of the NHS average; 7 days compared with 15 days. A day in an NHS general or surgical ward costs up 
to GBP400 a day, depending on additional care required; in an intensive care unit it costs GBP1,200 or 
more according to the Department of Health published Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs) reference cost 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Clinical Trial Results
data. The potential productivity gains and financial savings to the NHS from reducing the length of 
hospital stay are huge.
 Use of the CardioQ has been proven to reduce length of hospital stay in numerous different surgical 
specialities including orthopaedic, colorectal, cardiac and general surgery. In evidence submitted to the 
Health Select Committee on June 2006, the Improving Surgical Outcomes Group (ISOG) estimatedthat up to one 
million NHS patients a year could benefit from being treated under the guidance of the CardioQ during 
surgery. If all NHS patients having major surgery were treated with the CardioQ, the NHS could save 
between GBP350 million and GBP1 billion a year, according to ISOG evidence.
 Mr Alan Horgan, Consultant Colorectal Surgeon at the Freeman Hospital, leader of the study said:
 "These results are remarkable. Everyone involved in surgery and NHS management should read this study.
 "Fluid-balance during and after surgery is incredibly important to patient wellbeing. Being able to 
monitor and maintain balance more accurately with CardioQ has allowed us to take days off patient recovery 
time. We have proven that it is possible to save the NHS both time and money, while also enhancing patient 
care."
 Deltex Medical's chief executive, Andy Hill, commented:
 "CardioQ has now been proven to work in seven independent randomised controlled clinical trials. This 
study has shown once again that it benefits patients and can deliver dramatic improvements to hospital 
productivity and financial efficiency.
 "In the current climate of financial deficits, embracing this technology should be a no-brainer for the 
NHS. Fantastic results like this confirm once more that NHS Trusts can both save money and improve patient 
care through prioritising the adoption of our technology. We are working with large numbers of doctors 
throughout the UK who are seeking the necessary funding to use the CardioQ as a standard of care and we 
expect that this study will allow them to push harder than ever before to secure that funding."

 Notes for Editors
 Deltex Medical manufactures and markets the CardioQ monitor, which uses disposable ultra-sound probes 
inserted into the oesophagus to determine the amount of blood being pumped around the body - 'circulating 
blood volume'. Reduced circulating blood volume is known as hypovolaemia, which leads to insufficient 
oxygen being delivered to the organs. This causes medical complications including peripheral and major 
organ failure which can lead to death. Hypovolaemia, which is akin to severe dehydration, affects 
virtually every patient having surgery because of the combined effects of pre-operative starvation, the 
impact of the anaesthetic agents and trauma from the surgery itself. Using fluids and drugs, guided by the 
CardioQ, to optimise the amount of circulating blood significantly reduces post-operative complications 
allowing patients to make a faster, more complete recovery and return home earlier.
 The CardioQ incorporates the Company's proprietary software and a small diameter, easy-to-use, minimally 
invasive, disposable oesophageal probe that is used for transmitting and receiving an ultra-sound signal. 
By using this technology, the CardioQ provides clinicians with the ability to haemodynamically optimise 
critically ill patients and those undergoing routine moderate to major surgery through the controlled 
administration of fluid and drugs. Haemodynamic optimisation has been scientifically proven to improve the 
speed and quality of patient recovery and reduce hospital stay.
 There are already over 1,250 CardioQs currently in use in hospitals worldwide and distribution 
arrangements are in place in over 30 countries. In addition, there are currently more than 90 clinical 
publications on the use of the CardioQ which have repeatedly:-
 --      Validated the results of the Monitor against known standards for measuring cardiac output, 
demonstrating that the technology works
 --      Proved that the CardioQ works in a wide range of surgical procedures
 --      Demonstrated that the Company's technology provides significant health and economic benefits by 
helping to reduce post-operative complications and length of hospital stays by an average of 30 to 40 per 
cent for a wide range of patients.

 PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT - YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
 SUMMARY
2004         2003        Change
Operating profit before goodwill
 amortisation and exceptionals       GBP2,830m    GBP2,781m    +2%
 Pre-tax profit                      GBP1,886m    GBP1,567m     +20%
 Adjusted earnings per share          75.83p       69.21p       +10%
 Dividends per share                  41.90p       38.80p        +8%
--     Operating profit, before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
 items, was 2 per cent higher at GBP2,830 million. The results
 were
 adversely affected by sterling average rates strengthening
 against almost all currencies. At comparable rates of exchange,
 operating profit, before goodwill and exceptional items,
 would
 have risen by 7 per cent. This reflected the benefit from
 the
 ETI acquisition and a good performance in all regions except
 America-Pacific.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0057A
 --     Group volumes, including make-your-own cigarette "stix",
 grew by
 8 per cent to 853 billion, mainly due to additional volumes
 from
 acquisitions and the Reynolds American transaction. Volumes
 include the whole of the Reynolds American volume, as is
 the case
 with our other associated companies. Global drive brands
 were
 2 per cent ahead of last year.
 --     Pre-tax profit was up 20 per cent at GBP1,886 million, reflecting
 higher total operating profit and a gain on the disposal
 of
 subsidiaries compared to a loss in 2003, while basic earnings
 per
 share rose to 52.20p (2003 26.93p).
 --     Adjusted diluted earnings per share at 75.83p were up 10
 per
 cent, benefiting from higher operating profit, the reduced
 effective tax rate, lower minority interests and the impact
 of
 the share buy-back programme.
 --     The Board is recommending a final dividend of 29.2p up 8
 per
 cent, which will be paid on 4 May 2005. This will take the
 growth in dividends for the year as a whole to 8 per cent.
 --     The Chairman, Jan du Plessis, commented "It has been a good
 year
 for the Group, with all regions apart from America-Pacific
 achieving organic growth at comparable rates of exchange.
 This
 demonstrates the fundamental strength provided by British
 American Tobacco's successful strategy and geographical
 diversity. Our goal remains to grow earnings per share,
 on
 average, by high single figures and to pay out at least
 half of
 our earnings in dividends. Our success over the last three
 years
 has enabled us to deliver an average total shareholder return
 of
 20.8 per cent a year, compared to 2.4 per cent for the FTSE
 100."

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT    2.
British American Tobacco's operating profit before goodwill
 amortisation and exceptional items grew by 2 per cent to
 GBP2,830 million at current rates of exchange. At comparable rates of
 exchange, the improvement would have been 7 per cent. Adjusted
 diluted earnings per share increased by 10 per cent to 75.83p,
 reflecting the increase in operating profit, the reduced effective
 tax rate, lower minority interests and the impact of the share buy-
 back programme.
 During the year, 59 million shares have been repurchased,
 representing 2.8 per cent of the average number of shares in issue
 during 2004, at a cost of around GBP490 million and at an average
 price of GBP8.35 per share. This brings the total number of shares
 bought back since the programme was launched in 2003 to 165 million,
 accounting for 8 per cent of the total outstanding, at a cost of
 almost GBP1.2 billion.  We expect to restart the share buy-back
 programme following the announcement of these results.
 The Board has proposed a final dividend of 29.2p per share, bringing
 the total for the year to 41.9p, an increase of 8 per cent. The
 dividend will be paid on 4 May to shareholders on the Register at
 11 March.
 In future, when the Board is considering the interim dividend, its
 policy will be that the interim should represent one third of the
 previous year's total dividend, unless there are any special factors
 to be taken into account.
 Group cigarette volumes, including make-your-own stix, were ahead by
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0057A
 8 per cent to 853 billion, principally as a result of the inclusion
 of a full year's sales from the enlarged business in Italy, as well
 as five months' results from Reynolds American Inc., formed by the
 successful combination of R. J. Reynolds and the US businesses of
 Brown & Williamson.
 The completion of this transaction was a landmark event for the
 Group in 2004 and the integration of the businesses is progressing
 well. Our 42 per cent shareholding is now transparently valued, at
 around US$5 billion, and the Group has the benefit of an indemnity
 for all existing and future US litigation.
 The recent Appeals Court decision to reject the US Federal
 Government's US$280 billion claim against the US tobacco industry is
 obviously encouraging, even though the US Government is seeking a
 further appeal. Given the appeals pending in the Engle and
 Price/Miles cases, 2005 is set to be an important year for the US
 tobacco industry's attempts to put these three lawsuits behind it.
 Excluding merger benefits, there were strong volume performances in
 Russia, Turkey, India and Pakistan offset by declines in Germany,
 France, Canada and Japan. The global drive brands, Dunhill, Kent,
 Lucky Strike and Pall Mall, grew by 2 per cent. Kent's volume
 increased by 10 per cent to a new record high of 33 billion.
Chairman's comments cont...    3.
As this is my first Chairman's Statement, I would like to remind
 shareholders that there is more to the Group's strategy for creating
 shareholder value than achieving growth, vital though it undoubtedly
 is. It is essential that we maintain our balanced approach to
 achieving growth, improving productivity, managing our business in a
 responsible manner and developing a winning organisation. We will
 continue to drive all four elements of our strategy, in order to
 build a sustainable business and achieve leadership of the industry.
 In terms of productivity, we have continued to meet the commitment
 made two years ago to reduce overheads and indirect costs by
 GBP200 million by 2007. Building on the GBP64 million in 2003, we saved
 a further GBP89 million in 2004, principally as a result of
 restructuring throughout the Group. Given our excellent progress, we
 are now raising our five year target on overheads and indirect costs
 to GBP320 million per year by the end of 2007, around a further
 GBP170 million per year over the next three years.
 Additionally, we have reduced our supply chain costs over the last
 two years by GBP120 million per year, as a result of factory
 rationalisation and logistics savings.  We expect to achieve further
 substantial supply chain savings in the years ahead.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0057A
 On the responsibility front, I am pleased to report that we have
 made further progress in the eyes of those organisations prepared to

 CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
 These results provide a satisfactory position after 10 years as a listed company. They mark the end of the 
beginning and I expect to see them form a very solid base for growth over the next decade. We have made a point 
of increasing our dividend by 10% for each of the last 10 years and for each of the last 9 years and it is gratifying 
that the Board feel able to propose a modest increase in the final dividend for the year giving an overall increase of 
10.9% on that paid the 2004 financial year.
 Review of the Year
 In my statement this time last year I said that I expected the year to be one in which the Group invested in 
supporting its mutual management activities. This investment has now been completed and took the form of re-
enforcing and reallocating the sources around the world and additionally opening an office in Long Beach, 
California, at the end of the year. As things turned out however 2005 was also to be characterised by two notable 
events, the first of which was the unprecedented series of hurricanes, which hit the US gulf in the last quarter of the 
year, and the second of which was the completion of the Company's biggest acquisition to date, namely that of the 
LCL Group. Both events impacted beneficially the year's results and meant that the overall result reported below 
was better than we had anticipated it might be.
 Management
 During the year all of our mutual management operations progressed and produced a satisfactory return for the 
Company. The Mutual Development Unit in particular had a busy year and the fruits of their efforts are in part 
referred to below under outlook and current trading.
 Services
 All of the constituent parts had a year in which their results were either ahead of or in line with budget. Margins 
were not always what they might have been but all concerned worked to see that these were maximised. We do not 
pretend that every aspect of each of our operations is performing perfectly and there is still work to do particularly in 
the energy sector to ensure that the quality of our product matches the expectations of our clients on a uniform 
basis around the world. That said gratifying levels of support were provided.
 Aviation after a slow start to the year picked up significantly in the second half and can justifiably claim to be a 
market leader in its areas of operation.
 Run-Off Division
 This is of course the LCL operation which we acquired in December and as can be seen from these accounts they 
made a useful contribution to the overall result. I will not repeat the explanation I gave at the time of the 
shareholders circular preceding the acquisition but should reiterate the fact that this division is well placed to 
provide considerable returns in the future. There are two sources of income that we are looking for, fees from those 
who retain the division to assist in run-off operations, and capital releases from insurance operations acquired. The 
activities involved fit very well with both our management and services activities, in view of the accounting 
complexities and the size of the acquired operation we have felt it appropriate to establish it as a third division within 
your business.
 Corporate Governance
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0004A
 The Board continues to review how it should best be structured for the next decade and has already said that the 
role of chairman and chief executive will be split no later than March 2007. Attention has on occasion been drawn 
by third parties to the size of the Company's Board and this has been subject to review during the course of the 
year and the appropriate size and composition remains a matter of continuing debate. Within a people business it 
has been the Board's feeling to date that shareholder value is most likely to be generated by mature debate 
between non executives and executives. As your Company has grown over the last ten years this has worked well 
but there is a recognition that as growth continues a more traditional structure may become appropriate.
 Outlook and Current Trading
 In a Statement released prior to the Company entering its close period, we advised that all of the services units 
were operating at close to full capacity. This backdrop remains unchanged and indeed at this early stage it looks as 
if a very good year indeed is in prospect for the Services Division. As far as the Management Division is concerned 
matters of proceedings anticipated and it is of great pleasure that I am able to advise that the volume of business 
that we are undertaking with local authorities around the United Kingdom both in partnership with the UK 
Government and others has led us to create a Public Sector Unit. Their most exciting project at present involves the 
delivery of a new mutual insurance company, early in 2007 to the 26 London Boroughs. On the other side of the 
world I am pleased to be able to report that Capricorn Mutual in Australia achieved a record level of premium 
income for one month in March this year. One long standing supporter of the Company has suggested that my 
reports to you have been unduly low key and have not sufficiently drawn attention to the high quality nature of your 
Company and of its prospects. We are aiming to deliver good returns to share holders to the provision of high 
quality services to our clients. There is always room for improvement and as I have said on many occasions there 
are plenty of new problems and obstacles to overcome. If there is any doubt however about it may I confirm to you 
that the prospects for the Group have never looked brighter.
 Pensions
 The Board have been reviewing the Group's exposure in relation to its defined benefit schemes and addressing 
what can be done to make up the deficits reported elsewhere in these accounts. The overall position has improved 
significantly as a result of a good investment performance over the last twelve months. This remains an important 
matter to get sorted out and I will update you further in due course.
 In thanking our staff for their efforts on your behalf over the last twelve months I would like in particular to draw 
attention to the first class performance of our Finance Department which on top of all their normal work have had to 
absorb not only the impact of IFRS, the new accounting standards introduced for the first time this year, but also 
become familiar with insurance company accounting following the acquisition of LCL. I am sure that others within 
the Group have worked as hard but as an often forgotten but vital part of the organisation I felt that particular 
reference should be made for their efforts this year.

 Belgium: Revenues increased by 3% and APE was up a strong 16%. Excluding a Euro 103 million non-recurring 
single premium contract in 1Q03, revenues were up 9% driven by Individual business up 14%, fuelled by the Crest 
product and unit-linked business (up 37% due primarily to structured funds), partly offset by Group business down 
11%. The decrease in Group business resulted from lower single premiums, only partly compensated by higher 
regular premiums.
 4Q04 revenues grew a strong 33%, as three successful structured funds were launched during that quarter.
 Southern Europe: Revenues increased by 15% driven by strong Investment & Savings premium growth, both in 
unit-linked contracts (+35%), stemming from new distribution agreements in Spain, and in non unit-linked contracts 
(+12%), resulting from high single premium new business in Italy.
 Life premiums were up 7% benefiting from the growth in the bancassurance channel in Spain.
 Australia/New Zealand: Revenues were down 14%, due to product substitution into the rapidly growing mutual fund 
business and the planned reduction in retirement income business, following tactical price increases implemented 
during the second half of 2003 to maximize profitability. These were partly offset by a 5% increase in protection 
products.
 Fees, the key growth area for the Australian market, increased 17% as a result of fund growth in an improving 
market environment and increased sales through wrap accounts and retail unit trusts.
 Overall, APE was up 14%, due to the significant shift in business mix towards mutual funds.
 Hong-Kong: Revenues increased 5% and APE was up 14%. This increase was driven by improved retention of 
inforce business, combined with new marketing and productivity initiatives in the agency, advisor and broker 
channels.
 PROPERTY & CASUALTY: 25% of consolidated revenues
 Property & Casualty revenues increased by 3% in 2004 to Euro 17,852 million, with Personal and Commercial lines 
growing 4% and 6%, respectively, as the Group attracted new clients and favorable pricing persisted in most 
business lines. This was partly offset by further restructuring in other lines, primarily in Germany.

(a) In Spain, AXA Seguros purchased in January 2004 BBVA's 50% stake in Direct Seguros. As a consequence, 
Direct Seguros is fully consolidated starting January 2004 (versus equity method accounting in 2003). Spain full 
year 2003 Property & Casualty revenues would have been Euro 133 million higher if Direct Seguros had been fully 
consolidated as of January 1, 2003.
 Personal lines (59% of the P&C premiums) showed overall growth of 4%.
 Motor revenues (+3%) improved in most countries, due to moderate tariff increases and strong positive net inflows, 
especially in France (+154,000 policies), Germany (+139,000 policies), and Southern Europe (+159,000 policies). 
As a result, motor revenues in France grew 5%, above estimated market trend. Motor revenues for UK, including 
Ireland, were down 18%, as a result of AXA's continued underwriting discipline amidst softening market rates, the 
planned reduction in UK Personal Direct prior to its sale to RAC in October 2004 and the decrease in Ireland 
average premiums following rate reductions in 2003 and in 2004, reflecting an improved claims environment and 
risk selection.
 Non-motor activities rose 5%, mainly driven by strong growth in the UK (+23%) led by the increase in new business 
from Corporate Partners and intermediaries in Personal Household and Creditor. France experienced strong 
positive net inflows of 83,000 contracts in Household supported by the successful introduction of segmented 
products.
 Commercial lines (34% of the P&C premiums)recorded growth of 6% due to continued tariff increases in most 
business lines and strong new business in non-motor. Growth was +9% at AXA France, with the main lines of 
business registering increases in premiums above estimated(4) market trends.
 Commercial motor revenues increased by 4%, mainly driven by Southern Europe's renewals of fleet contracts, 
France's selective rate increases associated with strict underwriting control, and Belgium's rate increases.
 Growth in commercial non-motor revenues of 6% was due to successful tariff increases in most countries, 
especially in property and liability in France, the UK, and Southern Europe.
 Other Lines (7% of the P&C premiums) decreased by 3% mainly driven by a sharp decrease in Germany both in 
assumed business, in line with a reduction of share in the Aviation pool and Atomic pool, and in foreign activities as 
they were partly put in run-off.
 INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE: 5% of consolidated revenues
 International Insurance revenues declined by 6% to Euro 3,371 million, mainly due to a 15% decrease in 
reinsurance activities in line with the strategic repositioning of AXA RE implemented in 2002.

(a) In line with the legal restructuring of AXA RE and AXA Corporate Solutions Assurance, all businesses related to 
US entities in run-off, formerly owned by AXA Re, have been transferred to a new US holding company reported in 
"Other transnational activities".
 Reinsurance: Revenues declined by 15% reflecting AXA RE's strategy, implemented in 2002, aimed at reducing 
the portfolio risk exposure and exiting non-strategic business lines. As a result, the decrease was mainly explained 
by lower non-life gross written premiums (-15%) resulting from a sharp drop in Assumed Business and some re-
underwriting of the Marine account.
 Insurance: As a result of its continuing strict underwriting guidelines, AXA Corporate Solutions Assurance's 
revenues decreased by 3%, driven by lower activity in Property (-19%) and the decrease in Marine business (-5%) 
partly offset by a strong increase in Aviation (+20%) which was negatively impacted in 2003 by SARS and the Iraq 
war.
 ASSET MANAGEMENT: 4% of consolidated revenues
 Asset Management revenues increased by 14% to Euro 3,087 million in 2004, benefiting from higher average AUM 
(+16%), the result of very strong net inflows (Euro 35 billion) and market appreciation, partly offset by the 
depreciation of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro.

(a) Excluding management and front-end fees collected by AXA Investment Managers on behalf of external 
distributors, gross revenues increased 21% on a comparable basis.
 Alliance Capital: Revenues were up 10% compared to 2003, driven by higher average investment advisory fees 
from higher average AUM (+16%), higher institutional research service fees (+13%) due to increased market share, 
and higher performance fees (+13%), partly offset by lower fees on US long-term open-end retail mutual funds.
 AUM increased by Euro 19 billion from year-end 2003 to Euro 395 billion at year-end 2004, mainly driven by 
positive market impact (Euro 46 billion), net positive inflows (Euro 5 billion, of which cash management outflows of 
Euro -2 billion and net inflows from AXA insurance affiliates of approximately Euro 6 billion) and negative exchange 
rate impact (Euro -32 billion).
 AXA Investment Managers: Revenues(5) increased by 29%, while gross revenues, excluding management and 
front-end fees collected on behalf of external distributors, increased by 21%, due to a combination of higher 
average AUM (+17%) and favorable product mix shift.
 AUMincreased by Euro 54 billion from year-end 2003 to Euro 346 billion at year-end 2004 largely driven by Euro 
30 billion of net inflows, mainly from third party clients (Euro 23 billion net inflows, i.e., a 39% growth on year-end 
2003 third party AUM of Euro 58 billion). AUM also benefited from a Euro 24 billion favorable market impact, partly 
offset by a Euro -2 billion unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact.

 Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
 Introduction
 For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted income statement 
excluding exceptional items referred to below.
 Exceptional items for the half year ended September 30, 2005 consist of a receipt of EUR5.2m (net of tax) arising 
from the settlement of an insurance claim for the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
 Profit after tax increased by 20% to EUR242.2m during the six months compared to last year. The adjusted profit 
for the half year, excluding exceptional items, increased by 18% to EUR237.0m.
 The results for the period and comparative year have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standard ("IFRS") accounting policies expected to be adopted in the annual financial statements for the 
year ended 31 March 2006, and a detailed explanation of the financial impact of the adoption of these policies was 
set out in a separate document issued with the quarterly financial results for the period to 30 June 2005.
 Summary Half year ended Sept 30, 2005
 Profit after tax increased by 18% to EUR237.0m, compared to EUR201.3m in the previous half year ended 
September 30, 2004. These results were achieved by strong growth in passenger volumes and continued tight cost 
control, excluding fuel, which was significantly higher than in previous periods.  Total operating revenues increased 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -5-
by 33% to EUR946.2m, which is greater than the 29% growth in passenger volumes, as average fares rose by 3% 
and ancillary revenues grew by 40% to EUR129.4m. Total revenue per passenger as a result increased by 3% 
whilst Passenger Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 86% during the period.
 Total operating expenses increased by 40% to EUR664.1m, due to the increased level of activity, and the 
increased costs, primarily fuel, route charges and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the airline. 
Fuel, which represents 36% of total operating costs compared to 24% last year, increased by 108% to EUR236.9m 
due to substantial increases in the US$ cost per gallon, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro to US$ 
exchange rate. Unit costs excluding fuel declined by 7% as all other cost items increased at a slower rate than the 
growth in passenger volumes.  Due to the significantly higher fuel costs operating margins declined by 3 points to 
30%, whilst operating profit increased by 20% to EUR282.1m.
 Profit before tax has increased by 19%, less than the growth in operating profit due to the higher net interest 
charges arising from the increased level of debt, partially offset by foreign exchange gains which arose from the 
translation of foreign currency bank balances to Euro at the half year end exchange rates.
 Net Margins declined by 3 points to 25% for the reasons outlined above.
 Adjusted basic earnings per share has risen by 17% to 31.00 cent for the period.
 Balance Sheet
 The strong growth in profitability continues to positively impact the balance sheet with Total Cash increasing by 
EUR200.6m to EUR1,806.3m despite funding an additional EUR78.5m in capital expenditure from internal 
resources. The company took delivery of one 737-800 aircraft and funded additional aircraft deposits during the 
period. Total debt declined during the period as repayments exceeded debt drawdowns by EUR43.3m. 
Shareholders' Funds at Sept 30, 2005 have increased by EUR183.9m to EUR1,918.4m, compared to March 31, 
2005 reflecting the EUR242.2m increase in profitability during the period offset by a reduction of EUR69.2m 
resulting from changes in the accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments, pensions and stock options 
following the adoption of IFRS.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis Half year ended Sept 30, 2005
 Profit after tax, increased by 18% to EUR237.0m due to a 3% increase in average fares, strong growth in ancillary 
revenues, and tight cost control which was offset by fuel costs increasing by 108% to EUR236.9m during the 
period.  Operating margins, declined by 3% due to higher fuel costs whilst operating profit increased by 20% to 
EUR282.1m compared to half year ended Sept 30, 2004.
 Total operating revenues increased by 33% to EUR946.2m due to the combination of a 29% increase in 
passengers carried, an improvement in average fares and strong growth in ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 32% to EUR816.8m due to a 3% improvement in average fares, 
increased passenger volumes on existing routes, the successful launch of new routes and new bases at Shannon, 
Liverpool and Luton. The strengthening of the euro against sterling during the period negatively impacted fares by 
1%.  As expected Load factor also declined by 1 point to 86% during the period.
 Ancillary revenues continue to perform strongly with revenues growing by 40% to EUR129.4m in the period. This 
performance reflects the strong growth in on board sales, non-flight scheduled revenues, and other ancillary 
products. Ancillary revenues continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes and now account for 14% of 
total revenues compared to 13% last year.
 Total operating expenses increased by 40% to EUR664.1m due to the increased level of activity, and the increased 
costs primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth of the 
airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by a 10% increase in the average sector length, whilst 
higher US$ fuel prices were partly offset by the strength of the Euro exchange rate against the US dollar.
 Staff costs have increased by 21% to EUR83.6m. This increase primarily reflects a 14% increase in average 
employee numbers to 2,987 and the impact of pay increases of 3% granted during the period. Pilots, who earn 
higher than the average salary, accounted for 44% of the increase in employment during the period.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 18% to EUR53.0m. There are an additional eight 'owned' 737-800 
aircraft in the fleet this year compared to last year. The resultant higher depreciation charge was offset by a 
combination of lower amortisation due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the positive impact of a new engine 
maintenance deal on the cost of amortisation of 737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the euro to US$ also had a 
positive impact on the depreciation and amortisation charge.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -5-
 Fuel costs rose by 108% to EUR236.9m due to a 32% increase in the number of hours flown, a significant increase 
in the average US$ cost per gallon of fuel partially offset by the positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to 
the US dollar during the period.
 Maintenance costs increased by EUR0.2m to EUR25.1m reflecting an increase in the size of the fleet operated, 
and an increase in the number of hours flown offset by maintenance savings due to improved reliability arising from 
the higher proportion of 737-800 operated and the return of 6 leased 737-300's to ILFC.
 Marketing and distribution costsdecreased by EUR2.0m to EUR8.7m due to the reduction in the level of marketing 
activity and related expenditure compared to the previous year.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 28% to EUR20.7m reflecting an additional 7 aircraft on lease during the period 
partially offset by the savings arising from the return of 6 737-300 aircraft to ILFC.
 Route charges increased by 24% to EUR83.9m due to an increase in the number sectors flown, an increase in the 
average sector length, offset by a reduction in enroute charges in certain EU countries and the benefit of a stronger 
euro to sterling exchange rate.
 Airport and handling charges increased by 22% to EUR110.0m, which is lower than the growth in passenger 
volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at certain existing airports offset by lower costs at new airports 
and bases, and the positive impact of the strength of the euro exchange rate against sterling during the period.
 Other expenses increased by 14% to EUR42.0m, which is less than the growth in ancillary revenues due to 
improved margins on some new and existing products, and cost reductions achieved on certain indirect costs.
 Operating margins have declined by 3 points to 30% for the period due to the reasons outlined above which has 
resulted in operating profits increasing by 20% to EUR282.1m.
 Interest receivable has increased by EUR5.0m to EUR17.8m due to the combined impact of a higher cash balance 
and increases in average deposit rates during the period.
 Interest payable increased by EUR10.9m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the purchase of new aircraft 
during the period.
 The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the strong growth in profits during the period. The 
Company generated cash from operating activities of EUR311.5m. which part funded capital expenditure during the 
period with the balance reflected in Total Cash of EUR1,806.3m. Capital expenditure of EUR78.5m primarily 
comprised of the delivery of an aircraft and further advance payments for future aircraft deliveries. Long term Debt, 
net of repayments decreased by EUR43.3m during the period.
 Shareholders' Funds at September 30, 2005 have increased by EUR183.9m to EUR1,918.4m, compared to March 
31, 2005 reflecting the EUR242.2m increase in profitability during the period offset by a reduction of EUR69.2m 
resulting from changes in the accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments, pensions and stock options 
following the adoption of IFRS.

 Management Discussion and Analysisof Results ("MD&A")
 Introduction
 For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted profit and loss account 
excluding the exceptional items and goodwill referred to below.
 Exceptional items in the quarter ended June 30, 2005 consist of a receipt of EUR5.2m (net of tax) arising from the 
settlement of an insurance claim for the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
 Profit after tax increased by 66% to EUR115.7m compared to EUR69.6m in the quarter ended June 30, 2005, 
whilst adjusted profit after tax increased by 80% to EUR115.7m
 Summary Quarter ended June 30, 2006
 Profit after tax increased by 80% to EUR115.7m, compared to EUR64.4m in the quarter ended June 30, 2005.  
These results were achieved by strong growth in passenger volumes and continued tight cost control, excluding fuel 
costs, which were significantly higher than in the comparative quarter.  Total operating revenues increased by 40% 
to EUR566.6m, which was faster than the 25% growth in passenger volumes, as average fares rose 13% and 
ancillary revenues grew 31% to EUR76.6m.  Total revenue per passenger as a result increased by 12%, whilst 
Passenger Load Factor increased by 1 point to 84% during the quarter.
 Total operating expensesincreased by 32% to EUR429.9m, due to the increased level of activity, and the increased 
costs: primarily fuel, route charges, staff costs, and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the 
airline. Fuel, which represents 39% of total operating costs compared to 34% in the quarter to June 30, 2005, 
increased by 52% to EUR167.5m due to substantial increases in the cost per gallon of fuel partly offset by a 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Qtr Rlt Original HTML -5-
positive movement in the US$ exchange rate and a 2% reduction in fuel consumption due to the installation of 
winglets on a portion of our Boeing 737-800 fleet.  It is expected that the remaining retro-fit winglets will be installed 
across the fleet by year end.  Unit costs excluding fuel declined by 2% as all other cost items, other than staff costs, 
increased at a slower rate than the growth in passenger volumes.  Staff costs rose by 35% reflecting an increase in 
our crewing ratios primarily as a result of increases in our average sector length. Despite the significantly higher fuel 
costs incurred, operating margins increased by 4 points to 24%, and operating profit increased by 71% to 
EUR136.7m.
 Net Margins increased by 4 points to 20% for the reasons outlined above.
 Adjusted earnings per sharehave increased by 77% to 15.00 Euro cent for the quarter.
 Balance Sheet
 The Company's profit growth continues to generate strong cashflow from operations which for the quarter to June 
30, 2006 amounted to EUR269.0m. This cashflow part funded additional aircraft deposits and debt repayments, 
whilst the balance remaining is reflected in the EUR212.4m increase in Total Cash to EUR2,184.4m since March 
31, 2006. Capital expenditure net of sales proceeds amounted to EUR21.3m during the quarter which largely 
consisted of aircraft deposits. Long Term Debt, net of repayments, decreased by EUR36.3m with no new debt 
drawndown in the quarter.
 Shareholders' Funds at June 30, 2006 have increased by EUR117.9m to EUR2,109.9m, compared to March 31, 
2006.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter ended June 30, 2006
 Profit after tax, increased by 80% to EUR115.7m due to average fares increasing by 13% and strong ancillary 
revenue growth, which was partially offset by fuel costs increasing by 52% to EUR167.5m reflecting the higher US$ 
cost per gallon.  Operating margins, as a result, increased by 4 points to 24%, which in turn resulted in operating 
profit increasing by 71% to EUR136.7m compared to the previous quarter ended June 30, 2005.
 Total operating revenues increased by 40% to EUR566.6m whilst passenger volumes increased by 25% to 10.7m. 
Total revenue per passenger increased by 12% in the quarter due to a combination of higher average fares, and 
strong ancillary revenue growth.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 42% to EUR490.0m due to a combination of increased passenger 
volumes on existing routes, the successful launch of new routes and a 13% increase in average fares reflecting the 
positive impact of Easter on fares.  Easter is not included in the June 30, 2005 quarter comparative as it occurred 
earlier.
 Ancillary revenues increased 31% to EUR76.6m, a faster growth rate than passenger volumes, reflecting a strong 
performance in non-flight scheduled revenues (primarily car hire, hotels and travel insurance), on-board sales and 
other ancillary products.
 Total operating expenses increased by 32% to EUR429.9m due to the increased level of activity, and the increased 
costs: primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route charges, staff costs and airport and handling costs associated with the 
growth of the airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by an increase in the average sector 
length, whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partially offset by the strength of the Euro exchange rate against the US$ 
and lower fleet fuel burn resulting from the newly installed winglets.
 Staff costs have increased by 35% to EUR56.7m primarily due to a 32% increase in average employee numbers to 
3,655 and the impact of pay increases granted. Employee numbers rose due to an increase in our aircraft crewing 
ratios as a result of continued increases in average sector length.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 12% to EUR35.6m due to an increase in the size of the 'owned' fleet 
from 74 to 86, offset by a lower amortisation charge due to the retirement of Boeing 737-200 aircraft and the 
positive impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of aircraft amortisation. The strengthening of the 
Euro to US$ also had a positive impact on the depreciation and amortisation charge on new aircraft deliveries.
 Fuel costs rose by 52% to EUR167.5m due to an increase in the number of sectors flown, a 5% increase in sector 
length, and a significantly higher average US$ cost per gallon of fuel.  The increased costs were partially offset by 
the positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the US$ during the quarter and a 2% reduction in fuel 
consumption due to newly installed winglets on part of our Boeing 737-800 fleet.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Qtr Rlt Original HTML -5-
 Maintenance costs increased by 17% to EUR10.7m reflecting improved reliability of the Boeing 737-800's operated 
and a lower level of maintenance costs incurred due to the retirement of the Boeing 737-200's, and the positive 
impact of the strengthening of the Euro exchange rate, partially offset by an increase in the number of leased 
Boeing 737-800 aircraft from 17 to 21.
 Marketing and distribution costsincreased by 7% to EUR5.7m reflecting a lower level of spend compared to the 
previous quarter.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 23% to EUR12.4m reflecting an additional 4 aircraft on lease during the quarter.
 Route charges increased by 16% to EUR48.1m due to an increase in the number of sectors flown and an increase 
of 5% in the average sector length, offset by a reduction in enroute charges in certain EU countries.
 Airport and handling charges increased by 24% to EUR67.9m, which was slower than the growth in passenger 
volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at certain existing airports offset by lower costs at new airports 
and bases.
 Other expenses increased by 24% to EUR25.4m, which is lower than the growth in ancillary revenues due to 
improved margins on some existing products, and cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
 Operating margins have increased by 4 points to 24% due to the reasons outlined above whilst operating profits 
have increased by 71% to EUR136.7m during the quarter.
 Interest receivable has increased by 49% to EUR12.9m for the quarter due to the combined impact of higher levels 
of cash and cash equivalents and increases in average deposit rates earned in the quarter compared to the 
previous quarter.
 Interest payable increased by 12% to EUR20.6m due to the increase in the level of debt to part fund the purchase 
of new aircraft.
 The Company's Balance Sheet reflects the increased profitability of the group. The Company generated cash from 
operating activities of EUR269.0m that part funded the capital expenditure programme and long term debt 
repayments, whilst the balance is reflected in the EUR212.4m increase in Total Cash to EUR2,184.4m.  Total Debt, 
net of repayments declined by EUR36.3m to EUR1,641.4m during the quarter.
 Shareholders' Funds at June 30, 2006 have increased by EUR117.9m to EUR2,109.9m, compared to March 31, 
2006 reflecting the EUR115.7m increase in profitability during the quarter, the exercise of share options which 
increased funds by EUR1.0m, and the positive impact on reserves of EUR1.2m arising from the revaluation of 
financial instruments, pensions and stock options.

 Operating and Financial Review
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0009A -5-
 Overview
 Schroders is a global provider of fund management services for institutional, retail and private clients.  Its 
operations have a broad geographical span covering the main financial centres of the world, with 35 offices divided 
organisationally between the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.  The management of international assets is now 
concentrated in two locations, with a further nine responsible for domestic assets only and the balance acting as 
sales offices. We are committed to an integrated approach to the management of the business, designed to achieve 
maximum leverage of its intellectual and operational resources across geographical regions and asset classes.
 Over recent years Schroders has tightened its focus on asset management, outsourcing administrative functions to 
specialist third party suppliers and disposing of non-core activities.  Within the asset management field, the 
products cover a wide range of asset classes and client segments, but the management of equity portfolios still 
dominates the mix, with 68 per cent. of client investments in equities at the end of 2003.  Schroders' client profile 
continues to diversify, with retail and private banking clients now accounting for 28 per cent. (2002: 24 per cent.) of 
funds under management and 43 per cent. (2002: 36 per cent.) of net revenues in 2003 which are stated after 
internal fund management charges paid by retail and private banking to institutional.
 Most of Schroders' income derives from fund management services sold through third party or institutional 
distribution channels.  The principal exception to this rule is in private banking, where the retention of direct 
distribution capacity to individual clients and the provision of banking and trust services to supplement the core fund 
management offering are central to the business model.
 Results
 The Group profit before tax of GBP65.6 million for 2003 compares with a profit of GBP18.9 million in 2002.  The 
profits of the asset management business before goodwill rose from GBP24.7 million in 2002 to GBP62.9 million in 
2003.  The private equity business contributed a profit of GBP16.8 million compared with a profit of GBP12.9 million 
in 2002 and Group net income/(costs) saw net costs fall to GBP3.8 million in 2003 compared with GBP8.1 million in 
2002.
 Basic and diluted earnings per share were 16.7 pence and 16.6 pence respectively (2002: both 8.8 pence).
 Asset Management
 Net revenues in asset management before exceptional items fell from GBP440.4 million to GBP417.8 million.  The 
underlying profit from the core asset management business was GBP81.0 million (2002: GBP77.0 million), a rise of 
5.2 per cent. from 2002.  Asset management costs (excluding amortisation of goodwill) decreased from GBP415.6 
million in 2002 to GBP368.7 million in 2003.
 Underlying asset management costs (administrative expenses and depreciation less project and redundancy costs) 
fell by 5.6 per cent. from GBP368.7 million to GBP348.2 million.  Project expenditure was down 50.6 per cent. from 
GBP33.2 million to GBP16.4 million with a number of key strategic projects completed or approaching completion. 
Project expenditure comprises the costs associated with (i) the replacement programme for certain of the Group's 
core I.T. systems, and (ii) certain key Group outsourcing projects.  Our outsourcing of UK institutional custody and 
administration services to JP Morgan Chase Bank isexpected to start realising financial benefits in 2004. 
Implementation of an agreement with International Financial Data Services to outsource the transfer agency 
function for the UK retail business signed in June 2002 was completed in the first quarter of 2003.  The sales of 
Schroder Pensions and Schroder Hermes negotiated in 2002 were completed in early 2003.  Redundancy costs fell 
by GBP9.6 million to GBP4.1 million.
 Private Equity
 The Group's private equity profit of GBP16.8 million (2002: GBP12.9 million) was strongly influenced by the 
Group's holding in Schroder Ventures International Investment Trust plc, with the sale of part of the holding in the 
first half of 2003 combined with a mark to market gain on the remainder leading to a profit of  GBP10.7 million. 
Among other flows, further distributions were received from the sale of Homebase by Permira Europe II in 2002, a 
private equity fund in which the Group has direct and indirect interests.  Interests in certain other venture funds 
were written down by GBP1.8 million.
 Group Net Income/(Costs)
 Group net income/(costs) comprises income on the Group's liquid capital less Group costs and provisions - that is 
those costs not directly attributable to the other segments - and the results of the leasing business (before any tax 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0009A -5-
credits, which are taken through the tax line). An improvement in the income earned on the Group's surplus capital 
and a reduction in Group costs were principally responsible for the reduction in the loss in this business segment.
 Pensions
 Pensions have been accounted for in accordance with SSAP 24 with a net cost of GBP11.4 million (2002: GBP0.5 
million) relating to the Group's UK defined benefit scheme. Under FRS 17 the market value of the assets of the 
scheme is GBP353.7 million and the deficit on the Scheme is GBP20.1 million.  The FRS 17 charge for the year

Funds under management (FUM), adjusted to exclude GBP2.1 billion on the completion of the sales of 
Schroder Hermes and Schroder Pensions in January and February 2003 respectively, increased by GBP12.1 
billion from GBP86.2 billion at 31(st) December 2002 to GBP98.3 billion at 31(st) December 2003, of which 
GBP12.6 billion arose principally from higher equity markets.  New and existing clients contributed 
GBP21.4 billion, of which GBP12.2 billion was from retail and private banking clients.
 Commentary
 From certain angles, 2003 appears to have been a year of little change.   Net new business was more or 
less in balance, so that the changes in FUM over the year predominantly reflected market movements.  
Underlying asset management profits at GBP81.0 million were modestly up on 2002 (GBP77.0 million). By the 
end of the year our clients' asset mix (68 per cent. equities, 24 per cent. fixed income, 8 per cent. 
alternatives) was broadly the same as at the end of 2002.
 Looked at more closely, the results reflect a year of positive developments for Schroders.
 Revenues
 On the revenue side, the most important features were the continuing change in the balance of net 
revenues between the different distribution channels and the increase in gross and net margins.  In 2003, 
net revenues from retail and private banking amounted to 43 per cent. of the asset management total, up 
from 36 per cent. in the previous year.  This change was driven primarily by the success of our retail 
operations around the world, coupled with net outflows in institutional as clients continued to 
restructure their portfolios.  While the balance between the three distribution channels is changing, it 
is noteworthy that revenue margins rose in each.   In institutional, lower margin balanced business was 
replaced by higher margin fixed income and specialist products.  In retail, returns were boosted by the 
structured products area, offsetting the negative margin development caused by clients switching from 
equity to fixed income products through much of the year.  The drive in private banking to concentrate on

13.   Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 (continued)
 The IFRS news release issued on 9 May 2005 set out a detailed reconciliation by adjustment type on 
adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39. The pro forma information presented in the news release however assumed 
application of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2004. As such, it is slightly different to the information 
restated here, for statutory purposes, which applies the standards prospectively from 1 January 2005. The 
detailed accounting policies for the Group's financial instruments are set out in note 14.
 The key changes in accounting policy on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 are:
 --          recognition and fair value of derivatives, including embedded derivatives;
 --          fair value of investments that were previously cost accounted; and
 --          the separation of the equity conversion option within convertible debt instruments.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0039A -22-
 The following notes explain the material adjustments made at 1 January 2005 to the Group's balance sheet 
at 31 December 2004 to reflect the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
 (1)       The reduction in tangible fixed assets was largely due to a $171 million impairment triggered 
by the recognition of an embedded derivative. The derivative was in a commercial purchase contract in a 
Base Metals' operation and the resulting financial asset increased the carrying value of total assets over 
their recoverable amount, being their value in use.  The value in use of the Base Metals operation was 
calculated using forecast cash flows discounted using a pre-tax discount rate equivalent to a real post-
tax discount rate of six per cent, adjusted for any risks that were not reflected in the underlying cash 
flows. The resulting impairment provision, net of deferred tax, was taken through retained earnings as at 
1 January 2005 in accordance with transitional provisions set out in IFRS 1.
 (2)       On adoption of the two standards, loans and equity investments that were previously classified 
as fixed asset investments were reclassified as financial asset investments and accounted for as available 
for sale, fair value through profit or loss, held to maturity or loans and receivables as defined by IAS 
39.  On transition, equity investments meeting the definition of available for sale were restated to their 
fair values. The respective $58 million adjustment, being the difference in carrying values between fixed 
asset investments and the reclassified financial asset investments, was taken to the available for sale 
reserve, net of deferred tax of $10 million. No items were classified as fair value through profit or loss 
or as held to maturity.
 The Group's $526 million investment in DBI 10% non-cumulative, redeemable preference shares were 
reclassified from equity to loans and receivables as they meet the definition of debt within IAS 32. No 
further adjustment was required on reclassification of all other loans to loans and receivables, as their 
carrying value under UK GAAP was equivalent to amortised cost under IAS 39.
 (3)       All outstanding derivatives, other than commodity contracts which meet the normal sale 
exemption criteria of IAS 39, are now recognised on the balance sheet at their mark-to-market value and 
are disclosed within other financial assets (derivatives) or other financial liabilities (derivatives). 
Derivatives designated as hedges are classified as current or non-current depending on the maturity of the 
derivative. Derivatives not designated as hedges are classified as current in accordance with IAS 1. 
Derivative financial instruments that were designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows as at 1 
January 2005 were fair valued through the cash flow hedge reserve at that date. Derivatives not designated 
as cash flow hedges as at 1 January 2005 were fair valued through retained earnings.
 (4)       The $63 million increase in short term borrowings follows the separate presentation of foreign 
currency derivatives within other financial assets/(liabilities) (derivatives). The net $144 million 
increase in medium and long term borrowings is due to the separate presentation of foreign currency 
derivatives and the inclusion of the fair value of the interest rate risk that is being hedged, in the 
carrying amount of the debt. This is partially offset by a $143 million reduction in liabilities following 
the separation of the conversion option from the Group's convertible debt instruments.
 (5)       The conversion option within the convertible bond issued by the Company was fair valued at the 
date of issue and is included in equity, net of deferred tax.
 The conversion option within the convertible bond issued by AngloGold Ashanti is classified as a 
liability within other financial liabilities (derivatives). This accounting treatment follows recent IFRIC 
guidance.
 Notes to financial information
 14.   Basis of preparation
 14.1 The financial information set out herein does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts for 
the year ended 31 December 2005, but is derived from those accounts which were approved by the board of 
directors on 21 February 2006.         Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 have been 
delivered to the Registrar of Companies, and those for     2005 will be delivered following the Company's 
annual general meeting convened for 25 April 2006.  The auditors have   reported on these accounts; their 
reports were unqualified and
 did not contain statements under section 237(2) or (3) of the    Companies Act 1985.
 14.2 Accounting policies
 The financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC interpretations for the first time and with those parts of the Companies Act 
1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The disclosure required by IFRS 1 First-time adoption 
of International Financial Reporting Standards concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRSs is given in 
notes 12 and 13. Accordingly the Group complies with all IFRSs including those adopted for use in the EU. 
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the 
revaluation of biological assets and certain financial instruments. A summary of the principal Group 
accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to 
previous IFRS policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
 The preparation of financial information in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0039A -22-
at the date of the financial information and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event 
or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
 Early adoption of standards
 The Group, as a first-time IFRS reporter, has adopted early with effect from 1 January 2004 the following 
standards and interpretations as at 31 December 2005, the reporting date of the Group's first IFRS 
financial statements.
 --               IAS 19 Employee Benefits amendments
 --               IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources
 --               IFRIC 1 Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities
 --               IFRIC 2 Members' Shares in Co-operative Entities and Similar Instruments
 --               IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease
 --               IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental 
Rehabilitation Funds
 We note that IFRS 6 does not impact the Group's existing policy for exploration and evaluation 
expenditure.
 Changes in accounting policies
 The following IFRS accounting policy changes have been made with effect from 1 January 2005:
 1)             Financial instruments; and
 2)             Held for sale assets and discontinued operations.
 1)             Financial instruments

BUSINESS
 The Reed Business division has again performed well in yet another difficult year.  The continued decline of 
advertising volumes was in part compensated by continued market share gains, yield improvement and significant 
growth in online sales.  The exhibitions business has been tightly managed through weak economic conditions but 
has been adversely affected by the net cycling out of non-annual shows as well as the impact of the war in Iraq and 
the SARS outbreak.  Underlying margins improved through firm cost management.
 Revenues and adjusted operating profits were respectively 4% lower and flat at constant exchange rates, or 5% 
and 2% lower excluding acquisitions and disposals.  The underlying magazine and information publishing 
businesses saw a revenue decline of 5% due to the advertising market weakness, and the exhibitions business 
revenues were 6% lower, or 3% before taking account of the net cycling out of non-annual shows.  Adjusted 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0236A -5-
operating margin was 0.9 percentage points ahead at 17.8% reflecting the actions taken on costs to mitigate the 
impact of lower revenues and to fund investment.
 In the US, Reed Business Information saw revenues 6% lower than in the prior year.  Growth in the entertainment 
sector was more than offset by declines in the manufacturing, electronics and construction sectors.  Significant 
focus on improving yields and building share could not compensate for the volume decline.  Despite the revenue 
decline, underlying operating profits have risen by 23% reflecting the significant actions taken to reduce costs.
 In the UK, Reed Business Information revenues were down 3%.  Whilst display and recruitment advertising 
markets saw lower revenues, good growth was achieved in online sales.  Adjusted operating profits were similar to 
the prior year, with operating margins improved through firm cost management.  In Continental Europe, Reed 
Business Information saw underlying revenues down 5%.  Continued focus on market share gains and improving 
yields mitigated to an extent the significant decline in advertising markets.  Economic conditions in The Netherlands 
remain very weak, with only the healthcare and regulatory titles showing growth.  Significant cost actions taken 
throughout the year resulted in adjusted operating profits 5% higher despite the revenue decline.
 At Reed Exhibitions, revenues and adjusted operating profits were lower by 3% and 9% respectively at constant 
exchange rates.  Underlying revenues, excluding acquisitions and disposals, were 6% lower, or 3% lower before 
the effect of the net cycling out of non-annual shows.  Growth in Asia-Pacific and the majority of North American 
shows was offset by a weakness in US manufacturing sector and in Europe particularly in the international shows.  
Underlying operating profits were 14% lower, or 1% higher before the cycling out of non-annual shows, including 
the profit contribution from joint ventures.  Given the weak economic conditions in most markets and the impact on 
business travel of the Iraq war and the SARS outbreak, this is a very resilient performance and reflects the quality 
of the exhibitions business and very focused management.
 Reed Business is not yet budgeting for any real upturn in its markets and, taken with increased investment in 
online services, is not anticipating growth this year.  If, however, an economic recovery really does take hold and 
becomes more broadly based, then Reed Business should recover quickly, most immediately in its advertising 
revenues.  Given the dramatic improvements made in operational efficiency over the last three years, the flow 
through to increased profitability will be strong.

 reed elsevier combined businesses
 Profit and loss account
 The reported profit before tax for the Reed Elsevier combined businesses, after the amortisation of goodwill and 
intangible assets and exceptional items, was GBP519m/EUR752m, which compares with a reported profit of 
GBP289m/EUR460m in 2002. The increase principally reflects higher underlying operating profits, lower goodwill 
and intangible asset amortisation and a GBP65m/EUR108m reduction in exceptional charges.  The reported 
attributable profit of GBP334m/EUR484m increased against a reported attributable profit of GBP181m/EUR288m in 
2002, reflecting the improved operating performance and lower interest costs.
 The decline of the US dollar since 2002 has had adverse translation effects on the results expressed in sterling 
and, more particularly, in euros.  The strengthening of the euro relative to sterling has compounded this adverse 
translation effect on the results expressed in euros, whilst mitigating the impact on the results expressed in sterling.  
This translation effect does not however have any impact on the underlying performance of the businesses.
 Turnover decreased by 2% expressed in sterling to GBP4,925m, and by 11% expressed in euros to EUR7,141m.  
At constant exchange rates, turnover was 1% higher, or flat excluding acquisitions and disposals.
 Adjusted operating profits, excluding the amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets and exceptional items, were 
up 4% expressed in sterling at GBP1,178m, whilst down 5% expressed in euros at EUR1,708m.  At constant 
exchange rates, adjusted operating profits were up 6% , or 5% excluding acquisitions and disposals.  Adjusted 
operating margins improved by 1.3 percentage points to 23.9% reflecting the continued tight management of costs.
 The amortisation charge for intangible assets and goodwill, including in joint ventures, amounted to 
GBP445m/EUR645m, down GBP82m/EUR193m on the prior year as a result of translation effects and some past 
acquisitions becoming fully amortised.
 Exceptional items showed a pre-tax charge of GBP46m/EUR68m, comprising GBP49m/EUR72m of Harcourt and 
other acquisition integration and related costs, GBP23m/EUR33m in respect of restructuring actions taken in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0236A -5-
response to the effect of the protracted global economic slow down, less a GBP26m/EUR37m net gain on disposal 
of businesses and fixed asset investments.  After a tax credit of GBP84m/EUR122m principally arising on the 
exceptional costs and in respect of prior year disposals, exceptional items showed a net post-tax gain of 
GBP38m/EUR54m. This compares with a net post-tax exceptional gain of GBP11/EUR18m in 2002.
 Net interest expense, at GBP168m/EUR243m, was GBP38m/EUR84m lower than in the prior year, reflecting the 
benefit of the 2002 free cash flow, lower interest rates and currency translation effects.  Net interest cover on an 
adjusted basis was 7.0 times.
 Adjusted profits before tax, before the amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets and exceptional items, at 
GBP1,010m/EUR1,465m, were up 9% expressed in sterling, and down 1% expressed in euros.  At constant 
exchange rates, adjusted profits before tax were up 10%.
 The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was little changed at 26%.  The adjusted profit attributable to 
shareholders of GBP744m/EUR1,079m was up 9% expressed in sterling, and down 1% expressed in euros.  At 
constant exchange rates, the adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was up 10%.
 Cash flows and debt
 Adjusted operating cash flow, before exceptional items, was GBP1,028m/EUR1,491m representing an 87% 
conversion rate of adjusted operating profits into cash.  This compares with a conversion rate in 2002 of 89%.  
Capital expenditure in the year amounted to GBP168m/EUR244m and depreciation was GBP134m/EUR194m, both 
similar to the prior year.
 Free cash flow - after interest, taxation and dividends but before acquisition spend and exceptional receipts and 
payments - was GBP377m/EUR547m, compared to GBP378m/EUR601m in 2002.  Net exceptional cash inflows of 
GBP34m/EUR49m include GBP96m/EUR139m proceeds from disposals of businesses and fixed asset investments 
and GBP36m/EUR52m of reduced tax payments, less exceptional acquisition related and restructuring payments of 
GBP98m/EUR142m.
 In 2003, acquisitions were made for a total consideration of GBP226m/EUR328m, including GBP3m/EUR5m 
deferred to future years, and after taking account of net cash acquired of GBP9m/EUR13m.  An amount of 
GBP229m/EUR332m was capitalised as goodwill and intangible assets. Deferred consideration paid in respect of 
prior year acquisitions and payment of change of control and other non-operating liabilities assumed on the 
acquisition of Harcourt totalled GBP35m/EUR50m. The 2003 acquisitions contributed GBP16m/EUR25m to 
adjusted operating profit in the year and added GBP15m/EUR22m to adjusted operating cash flow.
 Net borrowings at 31 December 2003 were GBP2,372m/EUR3,368m, a decrease of GBP360m in sterling and 
EUR812m in euros since 31 December 2002, reflecting the free cash flow less acquisition spend, and favourable 
exchange translation effects from the weaker US dollar.

 especially after excise driven price increases in Brazil and
 Argentina.  This was partly offset by the additional volumes from
 the new business acquisition in Peru, good performances in the
 majority of the Central American markets and growth in Venezuela.
 Profit in Brazil was slightly down due to lower volumes resulting
 from an excise increase, higher marketing investment and lower leaf
 export profit.  Profit in sterling was adversely affected by the
 depreciation of the real against sterling.
 In Mexico, profit rose as higher prices were only partly offset by
 lower volumes and increased marketing investment.  Higher prices and
 productivity initiatives in Argentina led to increased profit,
 despite lower volumes and the weakness of the currency against
 sterling.
 Profit in Chile was down, although volumes were higher reflecting
 the success in both reducing illicit trade and counteracting
 competitor activities.  In Venezuela, despite the impact of
 exchange, profit grew as a result of higher margins and increased
 volumes, the latter driven by recently improved disposable income
 levels and a reduction in imported illegal product.  Volumes were up
 in Central America and the Caribbean, but the results were
 negatively affected by weaker exchange rates.

In Europe, profit increased by GBP190 million to GBP726 million, mainly
 driven by the inclusion of Ente Tabacchi Italiani S.p.A. (ETI) in
 the results from the beginning of 2004.  Excluding ETI, there was
 good profit growth of 10 per cent at comparable rates of exchange.
 There were excellent performances in Russia, Romania and the Smoking
 Tobacco and Cigars business, together with benefits realised from
 cost savings across the board following the closure of factories and
 a number of reorganisations.  These more than offset the impact of
 markets where excise increases resulted in lower volumes.
 Regional volumes grew by 7 per cent, reaching 268 billion, primarily
 due to incremental volume from newly acquired businesses and growth
 in Russia, partly offset by market related declines in Western
 Europe.
 In Italy, the integration has gone very well with profit from the
 combined business ahead of expectations at GBP184 million and market
 share of over 30 per cent.  The sale of the Italian tobacco
 distributor Etinera, as described on page 20, was completed in
 December, and it is estimated that Etinera contributed GBP42 million
 to the Italian profit in 2004.
 In Germany, cigarette market share was maintained with share growth
 from Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Gauloise, while total tobacco
 market share including cigarette "stix" grew.  Group cigarette
 volume and profit suffered due to a 16 per cent decline of the
 cigarette market, following excise related price increases.  As the
 Group is well positioned to benefit from the growth in consumer
 demand for other tobacco products, including cigarette "stix", our
 total tobacco volumes fell by only 8 per cent.
 Market share in France remained stable but both profit and volumes
 declined significantly as excise increases led to a reduction of
 21 per cent in the total market size.
 In Switzerland, profit was higher due to increased margins.  Market
 share also rose, driven by continued growth in Parisienne, although
 total volumes were slightly lower after an excise increase.  In the
 Netherlands, efficient cost management and price increases
 contributed to improved profit, while higher margins led to a strong
 profit growth in Belgium.

Russia reported impressive results with profit significantly up and
 a continued excellent growth in volumes, leading to an increased
 market share, mainly driven by premium priced Kent.  In Romania, the
 strong profit growth of last year continued as improved margins were
 achieved through the growth of Kent, Pall Mall and Viceroy. Although
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0057A -3-
 the total market declined in Poland, volume and share increases from
 Pall Mall and Viceroy resulted in good profit growth.  Both volumes
 and profit were slightly down in Ukraine while in Hungary, a massive
 excise increase led to an 18 per cent reduction in the total market
 size, adversely affecting volumes and profit, although the Group's
 substantial market share increased by almost 3 per cent.
 The Smoking Tobacco and Cigars operations, which will be
 incorporated into the Group's cigarette businesses during 2005,
 showed outstanding profit growth, led by price increases and the
 growth of volumes in all product groups, especially Pall Mall "stix"
 in Germany.
 Profit in the Africa and Middle East region grew by GBP29 million to
 GBP366 million  with strong performances from South Africa, Nigeria and
 the Caucasus, partly offset by the cost of continued investment in
 new markets and a large fall in profit from Zimbabwe.  Volumes rose
 by 7 per cent to 105 billion mainly as a result of the significant
 growth in Turkey, as well as increases in the Caucasus and Nigeria,
 partly offset by declines in South Africa and Zimbabwe.
 In South Africa, higher margins and the growth of Peter Stuyvesant
 and Dunhill led to good profit growth, as they were only partially
 reduced by lower volumes overall and increased marketing investment.
 Volumes were higher in the Middle East and North Africa, with good
 performances by Viceroy and Craven 'A' in Iraq and Kent in Iran.
 Increases in Yemen and Egypt were partly offset by volume decline in
 the Levant.  Overall profit was lower as increased costs to support
 market entries in North Africa offset improvements elsewhere.
 In Turkey, volumes rose with good growth by Viceroy and Pall Mall.
 However, investment to build market share continued and the company
 is still some way from break even.  In the Caucasus, both volumes
 and profit rose.
 In West Africa, volumes and profits were higher mainly as a result
 of increased market share through improved distribution and the
 strong growth by Benson & Hedges and Rothmans in Nigeria.
 Elsewhere in Africa, volume gains in several markets more than
 offset the decline in Zimbabwe, but the corresponding profit
 increases were not sufficient to recover the drop in profit in that
 country.

 ANNOUNCES INTERIM RESULTS
 for the six months ended 30 June 2005
 Overview:
 There has been a significant improvement in the financial performance of the Group in the first half of 
2005 compared with the corresponding period last year, with sales up 9% to GBP13.6M and pre tax profits up 
43% to GBP1.4M.  We have maintained our strong margins at 53% following the improvement seen in the second 
half of the last year when margins increased from 48% to 53%.  Now with the integration of Tecra complete 
and greater operational efficiency we have seen a 58% improvement in operating profits and net margins up 
from 7.7% to 10%.
 With the acquisition of MicroSafe announced today, we have enhanced our product line and further expanded 
our sales resource.  This acquisition will expand the business base and provide the Group with greater 
scale in the pharmaceutical and defence markets.
 The emphasis on achieving greater scale coupled with continuous improvement in operational efficiency is 
beginning to impact positively on the financial performance. The Company is in a strong position going 
forward, benefiting from a high percentage of revenues generated from own brands, recurring sales of 
consumables and direct sales.
 Financial Review:
 The Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements using International Financial Reporting 
Standards ("IFRS") from 1 January 2005 and have restated the comparatives within this financial 
information in accordance with IFRS. There are three main adjustments to the statements details of which 
are set out in note 11.
 --      The first affects the charge for goodwill on acquisitions made prior to 1 January 2004, with no 
further amortisation being required after that date. The effect of this increases profits in the period by 
GBP0.2M (2004: GBP0.2M).
 --      The second is the expensing of share options, which generated a charge of GBP0.04M (2004: 
GBP0.02M).
 --      The third is to recognise the dividend payable only after it has been declared. The interim 
dividend for 2005 amounting to GBP0.16M is therefore not deducted from retained earnings until after 30 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0066A
June 2005, whilst the 2004 final dividend previously deducted from retained earnings in 2004, is now 
deducted in the first half of 2005.
 As announced in our Trading Statement, following a poor first quarter, sales improved in the second 
quarter resulting in first half revenues of GBP13.6M, up 9% on the corresponding period in 2004 (2004: 
GBP12.5M). The continued weakening of the US dollar against UK Sterling, albeit at a slower rate, gave 
rise to a reduction of GBP0.1M in sales on a constant exchange rate basis. Excluding the Tecra 
contribution of GBP1.2M (2004: GBP0.1M), underlying sales growth was GBP0.1M.
 Profit before tax increased by 43% to GBP1.4M (2004: GBP1.0M). The profit was struck after non-recurring 
restructuring charges of GBP0.1M in the period (2004: Nil) and intangible asset amortisation of GBP0.2M 
(2004: Nil). Profit before restructuring charges and amortisation was GBP1.7M (2004: GBP1.0M) up 71%.
 As anticipated at the preliminary results in March gross margin percentage increased in the period to 53% 
(2004: 48%) due mainly to the contribution of Tecra, a favourable product mix and more efficient 
production.
 Overheads, excluding development expenditure, increased from GBP4.6M to GBP5.2M as a result of the 
acquisition of Tecra. This level of overhead was broadly similar to the total in the second half of 2004. 
The restructuring costs of GBP0.1M incurred in Europe are expected to yield cost savings of a similar 
magnitude on an annual basis. Management is continuing to focus on achieving operational efficiencies to 
reduce overheads in the second half of 2005.  The Group invested in technology and product development, 
incurring R&D costs in the period of GBP0.6M (2004: GBP0.5M), with GBP0.1M attributable to the inclusion 
of Tecra for the first time. In the period the Group invested GBP0.1M in Ruskinn to develop a new 
workstation for the IVF market. Similar levels of expenditure are expected in the second half and into 
2006, with sales revenue anticipated in the second half of 2006.
 Operational cash flow remained healthy with a GBP2.3M inflow in the first half, increasing by 17% over 
the corresponding period in 2004.  The cash generated from operations was applied to invest GBP0.4M in the 
business as capital expenditure and pay corporation tax of GBP0.5M. In addition GBP0.4M was paid to 
shareholders as a final dividend for 2004 whilst scheduled loan repayments reducing overall borrowings 
amounted to GBP0.6M. The Group also settled as expected the final payment of GBP0.4M related to the 
acquisition of International BioProducts Inc.
 Cash in hand at the half year was GBP0.7M and with borrowings of GBP3.6M gave a net debt position of 
GBP2.9M. The Group announced in January that the deferred consideration relating to the acquisition of 
Fred Baker Scientific Ltd had been agreed at GBP0.9M satisfied by the issue of loan notes. These have now 
been redeemed in July. Also in July, the Group purchased the minority holding of shares in Biotrace SA 
from its joint venture partner for GBP0.5M. Apart from the acquisition announced today, no additional 
consideration is payable in relation to any prior acquisitions.
 The tax charge for the period was GBP0.4M, GBP0.1M of this total comprised US tax which has been relieved 
against the deferred tax asset on the balance sheet.
 Earnings per share for the half year were 2.40p (2004: 1.72p), improving by 40% period on period.  
Earnings per share before restructuring costs and amortisation was 3.01p (2004: 1.78p) up 69%.
 The Board has declared an interim dividend of 0.40 pence per share, which will be paid on 11 October 2005 
to shareholders on the register as at 16 September 2005.
 Operating Review:
 Following a slow first quarter turnover increased 9% compared with the corresponding period last year, 
largely as a result of the acquisition of Tecra, with underlying organic growth cancelled out by further 
weakening of the US Dollar compared to the same period last year.

Body
 When a derivative financial instrument is designated a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a 
recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain 
or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.  When the forecasted 
transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, 
the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other 
carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.  If a hedge of a forecasted transaction 
subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, then the associated 
gains and losses that were recognised directly in the equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the 
same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss (i.e. 
when interest income or expense is recognised).
 When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation 
of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction still is expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when 
the transaction occurs.  If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, then the 
cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.  As 
permitted IAS 39 has only been applied from 1 January 2005 with 2004 comparatives in this respect 
continuing to be accounted for under UK GAAP.
 i)     Intangible assets
 (i)        Goodwill
 All business combinations are accounted for by using the purchase method. Goodwill has been recognised in 
acquisitions of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.  In respect of business acquisitions that 
have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition 
and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
 The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 
2004  has not been reconsidered in preparing the Group's opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 (see 
note 11).
 Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.  Goodwill is allocated to cash-
generating units (CGU's) and is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment. Negative 
goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in profit or loss.  In respect of associates, 
the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate.
 Impairment of goodwill
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0066A -5-
 The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount 
(by allocating the goodwill to CGU's) and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is 
lower. Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement.
 (ii)       Research and development
 Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense when incurred.
 Expenditure on development activities, as a result of the continuous nature of the Group's product 
developments and technical uncertainties relating thereto, is not generally capitalised   In those 
circumstances where research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or 
substantially improved products and processes, expenditure is capitalised if the product or process is 
technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete the development.
 (iii)      Other intangible assets
 Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses.
 Amortisation of intangible assets
 Other intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis from the date they are available for use, 
the estimated useful lives are as follows:
 -  patents - 18 years
 -  trademarks and know how - 20 years
 -  licences 8-15 years
 Other intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
 j)     Property, plant and equipment
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The 
cost of self constructed assets includes materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of 
overheads.
 Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic 
lives of each part of an item of property plant and equipment.
 The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
 Plant and machinery                                      15%
 Tooling and rental instruments                     331/3%
 Motor vehicles                                                 25%
 Furniture, fixtures and fittings                       15% - 25%
 Freehold buildings                                           2% - 10%
 The residual value of assets is reassessed annually.
 Impairment of property, plant and equipment
 The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each balance sheet date for 
indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets' recoverable amount is calculated and 
an impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value of the 
asset.
 k)   Inventories
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and 
selling expenses.
 l)    Revenue recognition
 (i)      Good and services - revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer.
 (ii)     Warranty or service contract income - revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the 
duration of the contract.
 (iii)    Government grants:
 Grants are initially treated as deferred income in the balance sheet then:
 - government grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred, are recognised as revenue to match 
the expenses incurred.
 -  government grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset, are recognised as revenue on a 
systematic basis in the income statement over the useful life of the asset.
 m)  Expenses
 (i)      Operating lease payments are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over 
the life of the lease taking into account incentives or fluctuating payments
 (ii)     Minimum finance lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of 
the outstanding liability.  The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
 n)   Dividends
 Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Difficult Doc0066A -5-
 o)   Income tax
 Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax.
 Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous 
years.
 Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes.  A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
 p)   Employee benefits
 (i)      Pension costs
 The Group does not operate its own pension scheme, but instead contributes to the personal pension 
schemes of its employees. Charges are made to the profit and loss account in the year in which such 
contributions fall due.
 (ii)     Share based payments
 The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.  The fair value of 
options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding
 increase in equity.  The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the 
employee become unconditionally entitled to the options.  The fair value of the options granted is 
measured using a Black Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options 
were granted.  The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share 
options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for 
vesting. Where bonuses are paid to Group senior management based on share price targets, the estimated 
bonus is recognised as an expense in the year in which it arises.
