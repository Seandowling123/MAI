LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Royal Bank of Scotland Group said it has set aside GBP800.0 million to settle claims made against the bank by 
shareholder groups over its 2008 rights issue, which was conducted only months before the bank had to seek a 
bailout from the UK government at the height of the financial crisis. RBS said it is willing to pay up to GBP800.0 
million to settle claims made by three of the five shareholder groups that have taken action against the bank. RBS 
said this would represent around 77% of the claims made. The money is covered by existing provisions booked by 
the bank.
----------
Life insurer Prudential has kicked off a review of its pension liabilities business, which could lead to a sale of the 
annuities business and a possible break-up of the entire company, The Times reported. The review is being led by 
Clare Bousfield, who joined Prudential in October as its UK division chief, the newspaper said. Bousfield joined from 
Dutch insurer Aegon NV, where she led the GBP9.00 billion sale of its retirement annuities business. The spin-out 
of the Prudential annuities arm could, in turn, result in a break-up of Prudential into separate UK, American and 
Asian operations, according to a source who spoke to the Times.
----------
Luxury fashion house Burberry Group has rejected several takeover approaches from larger US peer Coach Inc, 
the Financial Times reported. The FT, citing people briefed on the matter, said talks are no longer active between 
the pair, and this is not expected to change any time soon. Both Burberry and Coach declined to comment to the 
paper. The proposals from Coach were informal and would have involved a cash-and-shares takeover of Burberry, 
the FT said. It is unclear at what premium the offer was made or if Burberry ever engaged in any serious talks with 
the US suitor, the newspaper said.

Budget carriers Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air Holdings announced rises in passenger traffic in November. 
Ireland's Ryanair said it carried 8.8 million passengers in November, up 15% from the 7.7 million carried a year 
earlier. Its load factor for the month also improved, rising by two percentage points year-on-year to 95% from 93%. 
Wizz Air said it carried 2.0 million passengers in November, up 15% from the 1.8 million it carried a year before. 
Wizz Air's load factor in November was 86.8%, up 3.2 percentage points from 83.6% a year before.
----------
St Modwen Properties said it expects to post a performance in the second half of its financial year broadly in line 
with the first, adding that demand has allowed it to sell residential land for prices at or above book value. The group, 
which focuses on regenerating brownfield sites and building residential developments, noted its portfolio has 
continued to perform well in recent months, showing the interest in its New Covent Garden Market site.
----------
Hansteen Holdings reported increased investor appetite for multi-let light industrial property in the period since July 
1, and said vacancy in its portfolio has declined. Hansteen, which invests in industrial property assets in the UK and 
Europe, said that, since July 1, it has secured 836 lettings and lease renewals for more than 4.3 million square feet 
of space, securing annualised income of GBP16.6 million. Hansteen said its vacancy has declined to 10.2% as of 
November 30, representing 4.2 million square feet, across its portfolio from 12.9% or 5.3 million square feet, on July 
1.

MARKETS
----------
London shares were starting the week higher with Burberry among blue-chip risers. Wall Street was pointed to a 
higher open, with major stock indices pointed up 0.4% to 0.5%. The pound was firm above USD1.27, but the euro 
was lower in reaction to the Italian referendum result.

----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was due to tender his resignation on Monday after losing a crucial referendum 
on constitutional reforms that was seen by many as a plebiscite on his popularity. Just over 59% of Italians voted 
against Renzi's proposed reforms and less than 41% in favour, the Interior Ministry said, with all votes counted. 
Turnout was relatively high at 65.5%. "The 'no' has won," Renzi said at an overnight press conference at his official 
residence, speaking of a "clear and clear-cut" result. "When you lose, who can't pretend nothing has happened ... 
the experience of my government ends here," he added. The outcome - with potentially destabilizing effects on Italy 
and the eurozone - is set to be interpreted by Europe's anti-establishment populists as a boon to their cause, 
following shortly after Britain's Brexit referendum and Donald Trump's win in the US presidential elections.
----------
Pro-European and left-leaning politician Alexander Van der Bellen was soundly defeated his far-right rival for 
Austria's presidency on Sunday, in a re-run election that left mainstream leaders across the continent breathing 
sighs of relief. Green candidate Van der Bellen received 53.3% of the vote to Norbert Hofer's 46.7%, according to a 
projection by public broadcaster ORF based on 99.9% of counted ballots. The election captured international 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Italy 's Renzi To Resign After "Clear-Cut" 'No' Vote
attention, as a victory for Hofer in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the EU could have boosted similar far-right 
eurosceptics across the bloc.
----------
The eurozone's finance ministers are meeting in Brussels on Monday to assess the 19-member currency bloc's 
budgetary outlook for next year and Greece's progress on economic reforms. The ministers will spend the morning 
discussing the draft budgets for 2017, paying special attention to countries that risk breaking EU debt and deficit 
rules - among them, Italy. Tensions between Italy and EU officials have risen over Italy's anti-austerity budget plans 
that include tax cuts, pension hikes and funding to manage migration and prevent future earthquake damage. The 
top finance officials turn their attention to Greece in the afternoon, when Athens' budget, medium-term fiscal 
strategy and progress on labour market reform all come under scrutiny.
----------
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will push a GBP30 billion trade deal agenda as she visits the Gulf region this week. 
Attending the Gulf Co-operation Council summit in Bahrain, the prime minister is moving to free up business 
transactions between the UK and Middle East. May is only the third Western leader, and first woman, to be invited 
to the gathering. Speaking ahead of the visit, the prime minister said: "The Gulf is already our largest investor and 
our second biggest non-European export market and I think there is huge potential to expand this relationship in the 
years ahead."
----------
The UK government will go to the Supreme Court on Monday in the latest stage of the legal battle over Brexit. The 
highest court in the land is being asked to overturn a High Court ruling that the Prime Minister must seek MPs' 
approval to trigger the process of taking Britain out of the European Union. In a decision that infuriated Brexiteers, 
three senior judges said Prime Minister Theresa May lacked power to use the royal prerogative to trigger Article 50 
of the Lisbon Treaty and start the two-year process of negotiating Brexit without the prior authority of Parliament.
----------
British service sector grew for a fourth straight month in November at its fastest pace in ten months amid rising 
employment, survey data from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply showed. The 
purchasing managers' index for the services sector rose to 55.2 from 54.5 in October. A reading above 50 suggests 
growth in the sector. Latest reading signaled the fastest expansion since January and the rate of growth was 
broadly in line with the 20-year long-run survey average, IHS Markit said.
----------
UK shop prices continued to fall in November, the British Retail Consortium said. Shop prices declined 1.7% in 
November from prior year, the same pace of drop as seen in October. Non-food prices were down 2.1% year-on-
year. The BRC said food prices fell 0.8% year-on-year in November, with Fresh Food prices off 1.2% and ambient 
food down 0.1%. However, inflation is expected to pick up as the weakness in the sterling lifts import price inflation.
----------
The UK private sector growth remained steady in the three months to November, the latest growth indicator from 
the Confederation of British Industry showed. The index measuring the pace of growth in the private sector rose to 
+9% from +8% in three months to October. A balance of +11% expects businesses across most sectors to see a 
slightly higher rate of growth to continue over the next quarter.
----------
The euro area private sector expanded at the fastest pace in 11 months in November but the pace of growth was 
slightly weaker than initially estimated, survey results from IHS Markit showed. The final composite output index 
rose less-than-estimated to 53.9 in November from 53.3 in October. The flash score was 54.1. Still the reading was 
the highest since December 2015. A score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. "The improvement is 
enough to signal an acceleration of GDP growth to 0.4% in the fourth quarter," Chris Williamson, chief business 
economist at IHS Markit, said.
----------
Ireland's services growth improved in November after easing sharply in the previous month, survey figures from IHS 
Markit showed. The seasonally adjusted Investec Services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 56.0 in November 
from October's 41-month low of 54.6.
----------
China's private sector registered the strongest growth in more than three years in November, survey data from IHS 
Markit showed. The Caixin China Composite Purchasing Managers' Index was 52.9 in November, unchanged from 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Italy 's Renzi To Resign After "Clear-Cut" 'No' Vote
October's 43-month high. Services companies logged a solid increase in business activity, which offset a slight 
slowdown in the rate of output expansion across the manufacturing sector. The services PMI climbed to a 16-month 
high of 53.1 in November from 52.4 in October, survey showed.
----------
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key shocked the nation by announcing his resignation for personal and political 
reasons, after eight years in the job. "This has been the hardest decision I have ever made," he told a news 
conference in Wellington. "For me this feels the right time to go," Key said. "It gives the cabinet and caucus plenty 
of time to settle in with a new leader before heading into the next election." The country's next general election is 
set to take place in the second half of next year.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings reported strong interim results last week, but Cantor Fitzgerald 
believes this is priced into shares as it lowered its forecasts for the Irish budget airline. 
Last week, Ryanair reported an increase in revenue to to EUR4.13 billion from EUR4.04 billion for the six months to 
the end of September. Cantor analyst Robin Byde said this came just below the consensus mean of EUR4.16 
billion. However, profit after tax of EUR1.17 billion came ahead of consensus, which was EUR1.15 billion. 
While it kept guidance for the full-year unchanged, the airline lifted its long-term traffic forecasts to 200 million 
customers per annum by March 2024 from 180 million previously.
To reflect this, Byde lifted Cantor's passenger growth forecasts to match the guidance but said yields are likely to 
be weaker. 
Taking account of the passenger growth, and the mild profit warning in mid-October, the analyst lowered Cantor's 
forecast for full-year net profit by 5.6% to EUR1.34 billion. Forecasts for financial years 2018 and 2019 were cut by 
similar amounts.
The analysts assumes that there will be fewer new aircraft financed through capital expenditure, which boosts 
discounted cashflow forecasts. This results in an increase to Cantor's price target to EUR13.50 from EUR12.50.
Byde maintained Cantor's Hold rating saying: "Ryanair is trading strongly but we think that this is fully reflected in 
the recent outperformance of the stock." 
Ryanair traded up 1.2% at EUR14.26 on Tuesday afternoon.

IN DEPTH: easyJet To Brush Off Brexit And Continue Expanding

LONDON (Alliance News) - easyJet PLC on Tuesday confirmed plans to defy uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote 
by continuing to expand in the UK and Europe, though it warned the weak pound will weigh on its results further as 
it reported a drop in profit for the year to the end of September.
easyJet has just completed a difficult financial year in which it suffered a big hit to demand from the multiple terrorist 
attacks which have plagued the European travel industry of late, and from the weak pound following the UK's 
decision to leave the European Union.
However, shares in the budget airline were trading up 4.9% at 1,083.00 pence on Tuesday, among the best 
performers in the FTSE 100, as it announced plans to expand in the UK, France, Switzerland and Italy. The Luton-
based company also confirmed it will keep its headquarters in the UK following Brexit.
easyJet said it will increase capacity by 9.0% in the current financial year, having increased capacity by 6.5% in its 
last financial year, which ended on September 30. Chief Executive Carolyn McCall told journalists the capacity 
increase will lead to the creation of over 900 jobs.
"Almost half of our growth next year will be in the UK, with significant growth also in Switzerland, France and Italy. 
Our strategy of strengthening our positions at our key airports will see double-digit growth in key bases in London, 
Manchester, Venice, Berlin and Amsterdam," McCall said in the company's statement.
Numis said the 9.0% capacity growth plan is ahead of its 8.0% forecast, but pointed out that while it sees this as "a 
sign of management's confidence", the market "may have some concerns".
easyJet is the largest short-haul airline in the UK and the second largest short-haul airline in France and the 
Netherlands. In Switzerland it is the second largest airline overall, while having a 4.0% market share in Germany 
and 12% market share in Italy.
"We're taking advantage of our strong positions and consolidating them," McCall told journalists.
IN DEPTH: easyJet To Brush Off Brexit And Continue Expanding
easyJet first announced plans to expand growth in the UK in July, when its peers in the sector revealed they would 
do the opposite by cutting capacity and pivoting growth away from the UK following the Brexit vote.
Fellow budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air PLC, and British Airways owner International 
Consolidated Airlines Group all decided to cut UK growth due to weakness in the pound reducing fares in euro 
terms.
In contrast, easyJet's McCall said at that time that easyJet would "take advantage" of weaknesses in the other 
airlines by focusing on growing in the UK rather than reducing capacity.
Last week, however, Central and Eastern European-focused Wizz Air said it remains "highly committed" to the UK 
market where it continues to deliver double-digit growth, after seeing no signs of demand weakness on routes to 
and from the UK following the Brexit vote.
easyJet also confirmed on Tuesday plans to establish an air operator certificate in another EU member state, which 
will secure the flying rights of the 30% of its network that remains wholly within and between EU states, excluding 
the UK.
The cost of securing the certificate is expected to total around GBP10.0 million over two years, with up to GBP5.0 
million to be incurred in the current financial year.
McCall told journalists that she was "unable to confirm" in which country easyJet will establish the air operator 
certificate, but said the company is at the end of its review and will make an "imminent" announcement.
easyJet already has an air operator certificate in Switzerland.
As a result of the depreciation of sterling in the run up to and following the EU referendum, easyJet revealed on 
Tuesday an GBP88.0 million hit to earnings, although this was slightly lower than its most recent forecast of a 
GBP90.0 million hit.
In May, as sterling began to weaken in the run-up to the EU referendum, easyJet said it expected a GBP55.0 
million hit to full-year earnings. Later in July, and after the referendum, easyJet increased its forecast to an 
expected GBP80.0 million hit. Last month, easyJet upped its estimate again to a GBP90.0 million hit on full-year 
earnings.
Despite posting a slightly lower foreign exchange hit than that, easyJet said on Tuesday it expects exchange rate 
movements to continue to hit the company in the current financial year. The airline is forecasting a GBP70.0 million 
hit in the first half and a GBP90.0 million hit in the full year.
In addition, easyJet expects revenue per available seat to fall by mid-to-high single digits in the first half, after falling 
by 6.4% in the year just ended.
This came as a result of easyJet being forced to lower fares due to "external events", including a "cooling of 
demand" and reduced consumer confidence following the various terrorist attacks which have occurred in Europe 
and North Africa over the past year. 
Terrorist attacks included those in Brussels in March - when suicide bombers detonated explosives at one of the 
city's airports and at a metro station - and a July attack in Nice when a lorry driver deliberately drove into a crowd of 
people celebrating France's Bastille Day. The crash of an Egyptair flight en route to Cairo from Paris in May also 
worried potential leisure travellers.
Those events followed attacks by gunmen and suicide bombers in Paris last November, a mass shooting at a 
Tunisian beach resort in June 2015, and the bombing of a Russian passenger jet shortly after it took off from the 
popular Egyptian holiday resort of Sharm el Sheikh in October 2015. At the same time, demand for flights to Turkey 
shrivelled amid terror attacks and political turmoil, including an unsuccessful coup attempt earlier this year.
IN DEPTH: easyJet To Brush Off Brexit And Continue Expanding
easyJet's McCall revealed in the summer that the company had been forced to promote seats for June and July 
due to softening consumer confidence, having never had to promote flights over the summer before.
As the world seemed to get scarier, holiday costs also rose for UK travellers as the pound weakened following the 
June referendum, easyJet said on Tuesday. Disruption caused by air traffic control strikes and bad weather 
conditions, meanwhile, led to the cancellation or delay of more than three hours of 8,349 easyJet flights.
All those events piled up to hit easyJet's profit by GBP150.0 million in the year just ended, which on top of the 
GBP88.0 million foreign exchange hit, dragged its full-year pretax profit down to GBP495.0 million from GBP686.0 
million the year before.
This was at the top end of its most recent guidance and in line with analyst expectations, but Chief Financial Officer 
Andrew Findlay noted that the market expectation for the new financial year is for a pretax profit of between 
GBP405.0 million and GBP410.0 million.
Revenue, meanwhile, slipped very slightly by 0.4% to GBP4.67 million in the year just ended, from GBP4.69 million 
the year before, while its pretax profit margin declined by 4.0 percentage points to 10.6% from 14.6%.
While easyJet's results came in line with Liberum's expectations, the broker said it remains cautious on the outlook.
"Given the greater short-term risks to easyJet's earnings, its exposure to sterling's devaluation against the US 
dollar, and greater post-Brexit regulatory uncertainty, we remain cautious," Liberum said.
"Unit revenue comparatives for the second half ease, but first-half trends and guidance remain weak. easyJet's 
focus on long-term strategic advantage may well come at considerable short-term pain if weaker competitors do not 
retreat as quickly as expected," the broker added.
In response to a year best forgotten, easyJet cut its annual dividend to 53.8 pence from 55.2p.
On a more positive note, the reduction in fares helped easyJet to carry a record number of passengers of 73.1 
million in the year just ended, which is up 6.6% on the prior year, while load factor also reached a record 91.6%, up 
from 91.5% the year before.
"Looking ahead, the easyJet model remains strong as does the demand environment and we continue to see 
opportunities in the medium term to grow revenue, profit and shareholder returns. In a tougher operating 
environment strong airlines like easyJet will get stronger and we will build on our already well-established network," 
easyJet's McCall said in a statement.

EARNINGS PREVIEW: Brighter Skies Ahead As easyJet Departs Tough Year
EARNINGS PREVIEW: Brighter Skies Ahead As easyJet Departs Tough Year

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline easyJet PLC will close off a particularly bad year on Tuesday and point 
to further earnings pressure in financial 2017, but stock analysts remain sanguine given the fundamental strength of 
the business and likelihood for the picture to brighten in the medium-term.
easyJet notched up three profit warnings in the financial year to the end of September, driven primarily by issues 
outside its control.
The UK's vote to leave the European Union sent the pound plummeting, which weighed on fares received in euro 
terms to and from the UK. easyJet has scaled up the pound-related hit it expects to take to pretax profit on three 
occasions. In its October post-close update, it said pretax profit for the year to September 30 will be between 
GBP490 million and GBP495 million, down from GBP686 million the year before.
Consensus expectations are for a pretax profit of GBP495.0 million, at the top end of easyJet's narrowed guidance. 
DividendMax forecasts the group will pay a total dividend of 70.00 pence per share, up 7.7% from the 65.00p paid a 
year prior.
Over the past year, the currency hit was compounded by the damage to European travel and tourism caused by 
terror attacks, plane crashes, and political turmoil, particularly in Turkey. 
At the same time competition in the low-cost carrier space got even more aggressive. Rivals Ryanair Holdings PLC 
and Wizz Air Holdings PLC added significantly to capacity, as has easyJet. This growth in capacity is driving down 
fare prices at the same time that airlines are investing heavily, putting pressure on margins.
All of this is taking place in the shadow of Brexit, with the uncertainty this could cause having the potential to sap 
consumer confidence and willingness, and financial means, to engage in leisure travel.
In July, Chief Executive Carolyn McCall said the carrier had been forced to promote seats for June and July, an 
unprecedented move for the peak season of budget flights. McCall blamed that on shaken consumer confidence in 
the UK.
EARNINGS PREVIEW: Brighter Skies Ahead As easyJet Departs Tough Year
The immediate concern is a foretaste of the issues airlines would face should Britain leave the European Common 
Aviation Area, effectively the European single market for airlines.
All these problems are expected to continue for easyJet in its 2017 financial year. There are no expectations it will 
slow down its own capacity growth plans, even in the face of shrinking profit.
Analysts, however, are unconcerned. Citigroup analyst Andrew Light said easyJet won't be swayed from its target 
of adding another 8.0% of capacity in 2017, demonstrating a willingness to absorb a short-term hit in exchange for 
winning market share in key airports.
Light said many of easyJet's competitors are fundamentally weaker businesses and, by adding more capacity now, 
easyJet will shore up its position before an expected pull back in capacity growth from other carriers. When those 
weaker carriers retreat, easyJet's investments will start to pay back.
Unit costs and fuel efficiency will benefit from easyJet shifting its fleet to larger Airbus A320 jets, replacing its A319 
planes. That will deliver around 3.0% less fuel burn per seat. Total fuel costs in easyJet's 2018 financial year should 
be broadly flat, assuming spot jet fuel remains around USD500.0 a tonne, Light said.
All that will see easyJet stage a "strong recovery" in the 2018 financial year, according Citigroup.
UBS analyst Jarrod Castle said he anticipates negative free cash flow and a sinking return on invested capital for 
easyJet in its 2017 financial year. But, he said, easyJet has "material flexibility" over its capital spending cycle and, 
once spending slows, both returns and cash flow will surge.
Castle added the concerns for easyJet going into its next financial year all centre on issues it cannot control. Yet, 
the downside risk to earnings has been largely baked in after all the profit warnings the company has issued, while 
easyJet also has cost and capital spending levers it can pull in order to calm jittery investors, if necessary.
easyJet shares were down 0.5% at 1,049.22 pence Monday. The stock is 40% so far in 2016.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The European airline sector is facing significant capacity pressures and is operating in 
the shadow of Brexit uncertainty, but Berenberg said there are opportunities in the sector and the big UK-listed 
businesses offer the most attractive investment cases.
The German investment bank put Buy ratings on London-listed easyJet, International Consolidated Airlines Group 
and Ryanair Holdings, Hold ratings on Franco-Dutch Air France-KLM and Germany's Lufthansa, and a Sell rating 
on Norwegian.
Berenberg analysts Julia Winarso and Kate Somerville said airlines are currently making record or close to record 
profit due to a low-fuel-price tailwind, but markets are already looking toward 2017 with caution because of 
concerns around capacity growth and the potential implications of Brexit for European carriers.
As a result of this, the European airline sector has underperformed the MSCI Europe by 17% over the past 12 
months, the analysts said, but there are stocks in the sector suffering "valuation dislocations" which have the 
potential to drive outperformance.
Capacity growth in European short-haul routes will remain high and is predicted to add 5.7% for winter 2016-17, 
with low-cost carriers to add 11%. Most competitive will be the UK, with capacity up 7.6%, and Spain, up 10%, 
compared to 4.2% seat growth in France and 4.8% in Germany.
Winarso and Somerville noted, however, that capacity growth in Germany will speed up in 2017 when Ireland's 
Ryanair starts operations from Frankfurt am Main airport.
Ryanair has significant opportunities to grow its business further in Europe, the analysts said, particularly in 
Germany where the low-cost carrier space is under-penetrated.
IN THE KNOW: Ryanair And IAG Berenberg's Picks Among European Carriers
The carrier could feed into legacy carriers and into low-cost long-haul providers, which would be mutually beneficial 
for both parties and provide a "neat solution" for consolidating the short-haul market in Europe, the analysts said.
Winarso and Somerville said consolidating the European airline market would not be a "magic bullet" to the capacity 
issues the sector faces. The pace and scale of consolidation amongst European airlines is "slow" and, even when it 
does happen, the level of integration is low due to the preservation of individual brands and crew.
In order to reach the same level of concentration seen in the US market, some of the major carriers would have to 
merger, the Berenberg analysts said, including perhaps Air France-KLM and International Consolidated Airlines 
Group, or even low-cost rivals easyJet and Ryanair. Such a scenario looks "unlikely".
A key theme for 2017 will be costs, Winarso and Somerville said. With the benefits of the lower fuel price eroding, 
the focus will shift to real cost cuts. IAG, which owns British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, looks best-placed to 
deliver large, sustainable cost cuts, particular at BA.
This would provide an advantage over Air France-KLM, for example, as its softer approach with unions will not yield 
the kind of cost-base improvements it needs, given its cost base is currently around a third higher than the average 
in the sector.
The other overhanging concern is the UK's departure from the European Union and the uncertainty this creates. 
The most immediate risk, the analysts said, is a weakening of demand following the fall in the value of the pound 
and a softening of UK economic growth.
There could also be issues around nationality and bilateral traffic rights should the UK leave the European Common 
Aviation Area, the single market for aviation services in the EU. Ryanair, for example, could face shareholder 
nationality issues.
At IAG, the key to the investment case is cost cutting. Winarso and Somerville said IAG's management is skilled at 
re-allocating capital to the highest-returning parts of the group.
In addition, along with offering an already-attractive 4.6% dividend yield, Berenberg forecasts free cash flow will rise 
by 9% to 11% at IAG. Given the group has no need to de-lever, this leaves potential for higher payouts to 
shareholders in future.
The bank put a 595 pence price target on IAG, alongside its Buy rating. Shares in IAG were up 0.9% to 438.30p on 
Friday.
Ryanair, meanwhile, is the "clear structural winner" in the European airline space. It has the lowest cost base, 
coupled with the highest margins, asset utilisation and returns. At present, its margin is around 10% stronger than 
its rivals, the pair said, giving Ryanair breathing room to withstand demand or capacity shocks and allowing it to 
snap up market share as weaker firms withdraw.
Ryanair also has a free cash flow yield of around 5.0%, and there is potential for it to return around EUR3.00 billion 
to shareholders in dividends or buybacks over the next three years, Winarso and Somerville forecast.
Berenberg put a EUR16.60 price target and Buy rating on Ryanair. Shares in the Irish firm were up 0.5% to 
EUR14.06 on Friday.
easyJet has been hit hard by air traffic control strike disruptions, terror attacks, Brexit fears and currency weakness, 
the analysts said. Competitive pressures on the carrier are likely to continue through its 2017 financial year, but 
Winarso and Somerville argued consensus expectations now bake in those challenges.
As a result, the downside risks for easyJet are limited, allowing the analysts to be "cautiously optimistic" on the 
company. The pair said easyJet has a "fundamentally strong business model" and will ultimately be able to navigate 
successfully though any bilateral issues which arise because of Brexit.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it remains cautious on the 
outlook for its 2017 financial year due to Brexit-related uncertainty and weaker air fares.
But the group launched a new share buyback and upgraded its traffic forecast for the long-term, despite the 
concerns it raised.
Shares in Ryanair were up 5.1% to EUR13.42 on Monday.
In October, Ryanair cut its full-year net profit guidance to EUR1.30 billion to EUR1.35 billion, from EUR1.38 billion 
to EUR1.43 billion previously, due to the fall in the value of the pound since the UK voted to leave the European 
Union in June.
On Monday, the group said it remains comfortable with that guidance but remains cautious on the outlook for the 
second half, to the end of March 2017. It added this guidance is dependent on no significant adverse shift in 
airfares in the fourth quarter of its financial year.
In response to the effect of the Brexit vote, Ryanair has scaled back its plans for growth in the UK in 2017 and has 
switched this new capacity to growth markets like Italy, Germany and Belgium.
However, the group said it expects to carry just north of 119 million passengers in the year to the end of September, 
and the group has increased its long-term traffic forecast to over 200 million customers by March 2024, up 10% 
from its previous expectations.
Ryanair also said it anticipates unit costs for the full year will fall around 3.0% year-on-year, more than the 1.0% 
previously guided. Fuel costs will fall in the second half and will deliver significant savings, the airline said, but this 
will be passed on to customers via lower ticket prices.
For the first half to the end of September, Ryanair reported profit after tax of EUR1.17 billion, up 7.0% year-on-year 
from EUR1.09 billion the year before, as revenue increased to EUR4.13 billion from EUR4.04 billion.
EXTRA: Ryanair Cautious But Buyback, Passenger Growth Outlook Soothe
Ryanair said it carried 64.8 million customers in the half, up from 58.1 million a year before and said its load factor 
increased by two percentage points to 95.0%.
Sentiment on the stock was also boosted by Ryanair launching a new EUR550.0 million share buyback plan, to 
take place between November 2016 and February 2017. Ryanair completed its last share buyback, its seventh 
overall, in June.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the 7.0% growth in profit was a "creditable performance" in a 
market hit by continued air traffic control strikes and given sterling's slump post-the Brexit vote.
In the second half, Ryanair will open new bases in Bucharest in Romania, Bournemouth in the UK, Prague in the 
Czech Republic, Vilnius in Lithuania, and in Nuremberg and Hamburg in Germany. Last week, it signed a deal to 
open a new base in Frankfurt, to open in March 2017.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings provided interim results that came largely in-line with expectations as 
the Irish budget airline launched a share buyback programme, demonstrating balance sheet strength. 
For the first half to the end of September, Ryanair reported an increase in revenue to EUR4.13 billion from 
EUR4.04 billion in the previous financial year. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde said this was just short of the 
consensus forecast of EUR4.16 billion, but the company's profit after tax - excluding the exceptional gain from 
selling Aer Lingus - of EUR1.17 billion was ahead of the EUR1.15 billion consensus estimate. 
Ryanair said it remains comfortable with its guidance for full-year net profit of between EUR1.30 billion and 
EUR1.35 billion, but is cautious on the outlook for the second half to the end of March 2017. It added this guidance 
is dependent on no significant adverse shift in airfares in the fourth quarter of its financial year.
However, the airline lifted its long-term traffic forecasts to 200 million customers per annum by March 2024 from 
180 million. It raised its medium-term guidance for ancillary sales to 30% of revenues from 20%, over the next four 
years to March 2020.
Ryanair also launched a share buyback of up to EUR550 million over the four months from November 2016 to 
February 2017. Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said this emphasised the strength of Ryanair's balance sheet. 
UBS said shares will be supported by the buyback program and increased long term targets on traffic and ancillary. 
UBS and Liberum both have Buy ratings for the stock and EUR15.50 and EUR13.50 respective price targets. 
Cantor has a Hold rating and EUR12.50 target. 
Ryanair traded up 5.5% at EUR13.47 early Monday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are called higher on Monday as the focus sharpens on the US 
presidential election on Tuesday.
Bullish sentiment is set to return to the markets after the FBI told US Congress on Sunday that it would not reopen 
the case against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for using a private email server for government 
work.
"We have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton," the letter by 
FBI director James Comey said, adding that the FBI had reviewed all emails to or from Clinton recently found on a 
laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of close Clinton aide Huma Abedin.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 to open 69.84 points higher at 6,763.1. The index closed Friday down 1.4%, 
or 97.25 points, at 6,693.26 as political uncertainties in the UK and US continued to unnerve investors. 
On Wall Street Friday, the Dow 30, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all closed down 0.2%. US clocks 
moved back an hour on Sunday. 
In Asia Monday, the Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.6%, the Shanghai Composite is down 1.6% and the Hang Seng 
in Hong Kong is up 0.6%. 
In the UK corporate calendar, there are half-year results from semiconductor and imaging technology company e2v 
Technologies. Specialist insurer Hiscox issues a trading statement. 
Already released early Monday, HSBC Holdings posted a big fall in reported pretax profit for the third quarter of 
2016 but said adjusted profit grew, its investment banking business performed well and its common equity tier 1 
ratio of financial strength improved.
The FTSE 100 lender said its reported pretax profit for the quarter to the end of September was USD843.0 million, 
an 86% decline on the USD6.10 billion it reported a year prior. Adjusted pretax profit for the quarter, however, which

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London are called higher on Monday after the FBI told the US Congress on 
Sunday that it will not reopen the case against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for using a private 
email server for government work.
FBI director James Comey caused a political firestorm when he wrote to Congress on October 28 saying 
investigators had learned of emails "that appear to be pertinent to the investigation" into Clinton's private email 
server on the laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of close Clinton aide Huma Abedin.
Clinton had a private email server in the basement of her home in Chappaqua, New York, that she used not just for 
personal correspondence, but also official business as America's top diplomat - an arrangement that potentially 
made classified information vulnerable to hacking.
On Sunday, Comey said the agency had not changed its opinion formed in July, that Hillary Clinton shouldn't face 
criminal charges.
Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, says the FBI's clearance is good news for Clinton and 
investors who have an appetite for risk.
"The base case scenario for most of the traders is that Hilary Clinton will be a winner of the US election," Aslam 
says. 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 to open 71.84 points higher at 6,765.1. The index closed Friday down 1.4%, 
or 97.25 points, at 6,693.26 as political uncertainties in the UK and US continued to unnerve investors.
On Wall Street Friday, the Dow 30, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all closed down 0.2%. US clocks 
moved back an hour on Sunday, restoring a five-hour difference between NY and London.
In Asia Monday, the Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.6%, the Shanghai Composite ended down 1.4% while the Hang 
Seng in Hong Kong continues up 0.9%.

Business information and events company Informa said it remains on track for the full-year amid solid trading in the 
majority of its divisions in the first nine months of 2016.
The FTSE 100 group said organic revenue in its Global Exhibitions division grew 11% in the nine months to the end 
of September year-on-year. While the fourth quarter is traditionally quieter for this unit, advance bookings for 2017 
look robust, Informa said.
"Informa continues to make both operational and financial progress through 2016, and remains on track to deliver 
another year of growth in revenue, profits and earnings," said Stephen Carter, Informa's chief executive.
Diversified engineer Smiths Group sold its Wallace product line, parts of its medical devices unit, to CooperSurgical 
for GBP140.0 million.
Smith said the sale of the business, which was a pioneer in the creation of the embryo replacement catheter, is in 
line with its push to focus on areas where it has market-leading positions and said the proceeds will be re-invested 
in the business in line with that strategy.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Risk back on. London share prices were higher, while gold and the pound were lower 
early Monday.
On a day that normally would be all about earnings from the UK's largest bank, HSBC, and big names such as 
Ryanair, instead the US presidential election on Tuesday dominated attention and market activity.
The FBI announced it will not reopen the case against US Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, having reviewed 
the new emails it had found. Clinton's poll ratings rose in response and worries about a market sell-off on 
Wednesday in the event of a victory by Republican Donald Trump receded.

US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has questioned FBI director James Comey's clearing of rival 
Hillary Clinton of any illegality regarding recently uncovered emails. Speaking at a campaign rally at Sterling 
Heights in the US state of Michigan on Sunday evening, Trump claimed that "a rigged system" was protecting the 
Democratic presidential candidate. Earlier Sunday, the director of the FBI said his agency had not changed its 
opinion formed in July, that Hillary Clinton shouldn't face criminal charges for using a private email server while she 
was secretary of state. A nationwide poll released Sunday by broadcaster ABC and the Washington Post showed 
Clinton with a lead of 5 percentage points going into the final hours of the long campaign. Another poll by 
broadcaster NBC and the Wall Street Journal showed her with a 4-point lead nationwide.
----------
UK Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear she is not ready to back down on new immigration controls in any 
parliamentary Brexit battle. Speaking as she arrived in India on a three-day trade visit, the Prime Minister insisted 
the government has a "strong" case to persuade Supreme Court judges to overturn last week's High Court decision 
that MPs and peers should vote on the launch of EU withdrawal talks. And she gave short shrift to suggestions that 
Parliament might tie her hands by requiring her to make continued single market membership her priority during 
withdrawal talks under Article 50 of the European treaties.
----------
May is visiting India with the aim of boosting ties with one of the world's fastest growing economies, as her 
government looks at reworking relations in the context of a planned exit from the EU. May, who arrived in New Delhi 
late Sunday, is scheduled to begin the day with a speech at the UK-India Tech Summit in New Delhi which is 
showcasing technological innovations by British companies. Leading a 40-member business delegation, May is 
later scheduled to hold talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
----------
UK private sector growth ticked up in the three months to the end of October, with the economy expected to 
continue growing at a "healthy pace" in the next three months, the Confederation of British Industry said. The CBI's 
Growth Indicator, a survey of 764 businesses in the UK, showed a +8% reading compared to +3% for the three 
months to the end of September. However, the survey showed a mixed private sector performance. Output 
continued to rise at a "robust pace" in manufacturing and distribution during the recent period. However, activity 
within consumer services remained flat, and there was only a slight growth in business and professional services.
----------
UK manufacturers are set to cut back on investment plans in the next two years because of increased uncertainty 
following the EU referendum vote, a new study shows. A survey of more than 300 companies by the EEF, the UK 
manufacturing industry trade body, found that three out of five were planning to spend the same or less on plant 
and machinery, an increase on previous years. Uncertainty over future orders was the main reason affecting 
confidence, with some business leaders blaming political uncertainty.
----------
LONDON BRIEFING: Fears Of Trump Stock Dump Recede As Clinton Cleared
Britain's economic recovery is at risk if it ends up with a so-called hard Brexit from the European Union, a respected 
think-tank has warned. High levels of immigration and foreign capital helped the UK bounce back more quickly than 
single currency nations after the 2008 crash, Chatham House said. A divorce settlement that curbed migration and 
investment flows would jeopardise future prosperity, according to its report.
----------
British Justice Minister Liz Truss defended the country's High Court over its decision on Brexit, saying the 
independence of the judiciary is the "foundation upon which our rule of law is built". Truss' comments follow 
widespread condemnation by some members of the ruling Conservative party as well as sections of the media in 
the wake of the ruling on Thursday that British Prime Minister Theresa May must seek parliamentary approval 
before she begins negotiations on Britain leaving the EU, or Brexit.
----------
The biggest train drivers' union has suspended a strike ballot it had just started among its members on Southern 
Railway because of "technical difficulties". Aslef had asked its members if they wanted to take industrial action in a 
dispute over driver-only trains. The result of the ballot was due within two weeks, raising the threat of strikes at the 
end of the month. Southern still faces a series of strikes in the coming weeks by the Rail, Maritime and Transport 
union in the bitter dispute over the role of conductors. The latest 48-hour walkout ended on Saturday night, with 
further stoppages planned later this month, early December, in the run up to Christmas and over new year.
----------
The UK is expected to shiver through another chilly week after air moving in from the Arctic sent temperatures 
dwindling down to single digits over the weekend. London barely exceeded 7C on Sunday while at Benson, 
Oxfordshire, about an hour out of the city, the mercury even dropped to -2.3C. Meanwhile, the first snow of the cold 
season fell in northern parts of the country including North Yorkshire and caused traffic headaches on a roadway 
near Nenthead, Cumbria.
----------
China barred two democratically elected Hong Kong lawmakers from taking their seats in a move that demonstrated 
"firm determination and will in opposing Hong Kong independence," state media reported. The Youngspiration party 
candidates are banned for their refusal to pledge allegiance to China and cannot retake their oaths, according to the 
newly adopted interpretation of an article in the Hong Kong constitution.
----------
Members of the Bank of Japan's monetary policy board said the country's economic recovery was continuing at a 
satisfactory pace, the minutes from the bank's September 20 and 21 meeting revealed. Inflation is trending higher, 
although it's been slightly weaker in recent months, the bank said - adding that exports and production are likely to 
remain sluggish in the near term. Risks to the economic outlook include Britain's withdrawal from the EU, US 
monetary policy and the health of the Chinese economy.
----------
Germany's factory orders contracted unexpectedly in September largely due to a fall in domestic demand, figures 
from Destatis showed. Factory orders fell 0.6% in September from August, when it grew by revised 0.9%. Orders 
were forecast to grow 0.2%. According to previous report, orders had expanded 1% in August.
----------
Heavy clashes were taking place on Sunday north of al-Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto capital in Syria, a 
monitoring group said, after Kurdish-led forces announced the start of a long-awaited campaign to capture the city. 
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces captured several frontline villages and farms about 45 kilometres north 
of al-Raqqa, while warplanes buzzed the area and targeted jihadist positions, the Syrian Observatory for Human 
Rights said.
----------
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected international criticism of his government over the arrest of 
politicians from the opposition pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party. Accusing the HDP of being the political arm 
of the banned militant Kurdish Workers' Party, Erdogan said he did not care about criticism from abroad. "It doesn't 
bother me at all whether they call me a dictator or anything like that," he said. "It just goes in one ear and out the 
other. Important is what my people say."

HSBC Holdings posted a big fall in reported pretax profit for the third quarter of 2016 but said adjusted profit grew, 
its investment banking business performed well and its common equity tier 1 ratio of financial strength improved. 
The lender said its reported pretax profit for the quarter to the end of September was USD843.0 million, an 86% 
decline on the USD6.10 billion it reported a year prior. Adjusted pretax profit for the quarter, which strips out 
currency effects and the restructuring actions the bank has taken, grew to USD5.59 billion from USD5.24 billion. 
HSBC's CET1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, increased to 13.9% at the end of September, from 12.1% at 
the end of June and from 11.9% at the beginning of 2016.
----------
Business information and events company Informa said it remains on track for the full year amid solid trading in the 
majority of its divisions in the first nine months of 2016. The group said organic revenue in its Global Exhibitions 
division grew 11% in the nine months to the end of September year-on-year. While the fourth quarter is traditionally 
quieter for this unit, advance bookings for 2017 look robust, Informa said.
----------
Diversified engineer Smiths Group said it has sold its Wallace product line, parts of its medical devices unit, to US-
based CooperSurgical for GBP140.0 million. Smith said the sale of the business, which was a pioneer in the 
creation of the embryo replacement catheter, is in line with its push to focus on areas where it has market-leading 
positions and said the proceeds will be re-invested in the business in line with that strategy.
----------
UK energy market regulator Ofgem said it has accepted binding commitments from SSE to improve services to 
competitors connecting to its distribution network. Ofgem's investigation into whether SSE had impeded competition 
in the UK electricity market identified concerns in the way the utility provides services to competitors needed to 
connect new developments to its electricity distribution network in the south of England. SSE has now committed to 
putting in place new processes and procedures to remedy those concerns. It will split operations in its connection 
business to separate the team which provides essential services to the connections market from the team which 
competes in that same market.

----------
Specialist insurer Hiscox said its gross written premium growth in the first nine months of 2016 has been boosted by 
foreign exchange movements, but its London Market business is set to fall next year. Hiscox reported its gross 
written premiums for the nine months to September 30 totalled GBP1.86 billion, up from GBP1.54 billion in the 
same period in 2015. Hiscox noted this represented 21% growth in sterling, but 14% growth in local currencies, as 
the insurer benefited from the weak pound. 
----------
Funeral services provider Dignity said its results for the first 39 weeks of 2016 were slightly ahead of its 
expectations, driven by a higher number of deaths in the second and third quarters. Dignity has warned consistently 
that the death rate in the UK would be lower in 2016 following an exceptionally high rate in 2015. In the second and 
third quarters, however, the death rate was ahead of its forecast. Underlying operating profit, which excludes one-
offs, was GBP75.8 million in the 39-week period, down from GBP78.1 million a year earlier, but this measure grew 
by GBP1.8 million year-on-year in the third quarter. Revenue in the nine-month period was GBP229.3 million, up 
from GBP227.0 million a year before.
----------
Ceramic materials manufacturer Morgan Advanced Materials said trading in the second half of 2016 has been in 
line with its expectations, and it remains on track for the full year. In 2016 to date, Morgan said constant currency 
sales were down 1.9% year-on-year.

Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings said it remains cautious on the outlook for its 2017 financial year due to Brexit-
related uncertainty and weaker air fares, as revenue and profit rose in the first half. In October, Ryanair cut its full-
year net profit guidance to EUR1.30 billion to EUR1.35 billion, from EUR1.38 billion to EUR1.43 billion previously, 
due to the fall in the value of the pound since the UK voted to leave the European Union. On Monday, the group 
said it remains comfortable with that guidance but remains cautious on the outlook for the second half, to the end of 
March 2017. For the first half to the end of September, Ryanair reported profit after tax of EUR1.17 billion, up 7.0% 
year-on-year from EUR1.09 billion the year before, as revenue increased to EUR4.13 billion from EUR4.04 billion.

Samsung Electronics plans to equip its next Galaxy S smartphones with a Siri-like digital assistant, according to 
reports. Samsung, which last month acquired US-based artificial-intelligence software company Viv Labs, 
reportedly said the Galaxy S8 slated for next year will come with AI-enabled features "significantly differentiated" 
from those of Apple's Siri or Google. The flagship Galaxy S line will prove crucial to salvaging Samsung's reputation 
in the wake of the fiasco surrounding a Note 7 device prone to bursting into flame.
----------
German prosecutors have widened their probe of Volkswagen's management to include the carmaker's supervisory 
board Chairman Hans Dieter Poetschon allegations that they failed to inform investors about the US diesel 
emissions probe in a timely fashion. Volkswagen said that the Braunschweig public prosecutor's office has 
extended its investigation against two members of the company's board for alleged market manipulation to include 
Hans Dieter Pötsch.
----------
Westpac Group reported that its net profit attributable to owners for financial year 2016 was AUD7.445 billion, a 
decrease of AUD567 million or 7% compared to financial 2015. The 7% reduction reflected higher impairment 
charges in financial 2016 and a number of significant positive items in financial 2015 that did not repeat.
----------
Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on Friday reported a drop in profit for the third quarter, reflecting the 
absence of a large one-time gain recorded last year. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway reported third-
quarter profit of USD7.20 billion, down from USD9.43 billion last year. Last year's results included a USD4.4 billion 
gain related to the Kraft Heinz. Excluding items, operating earnings for the third quarter was USD4.85 billion , up 
from USD4.55 billion last year. Total revenue for the third quarter rose to USD59.07 billion from USD58.99 billion in 
the same quarter last year.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
HSBC Holdings shares led the FTSE 100 index, after the bank's third-quarter results showed an increase in 
underlying profit, despite one-off items and foreign exchange movements dragging down its reported profit. The UK-
based but China-focused global lender said its reported pretax profit for the quarter to the end of September was 
USD843.0 million, an 86% decline on the USD6.10 billion it reported a year prior. The reduction in profit was driven 
by a number of significant items including a USD1.7 billion loss recognised on the sale of HSBC's Brazilian 
business to Banco Bradesco. The costs of redress to UK customers also increased to approximately USD500 
million in the third quarter period from USD100 million in the same period the year before. Stripping out those items 
and foreign exchange movements, the bank's adjusted pretax profit grow by 7% to USD5.59 billion from USD5.24 
billion.

Bank Chief Executive Benny Higgins said some of its customer accounts were "subject to online criminal activity, in 
some cases resulting in money being withdrawn fraudulently".
----------
Fellow supermarket chain J Sainsbury said it has hired its new chief financial officer from single-price discount 
retailer Poundland Group. Kevin O'Byrne will join as CFO on January 9, 2017. He will replace John Rogers, who 
moves from being Sainsbury's CFO to become chief executive of Sainsbury's Argos. O'Byrne is currently the CEO 
of Poundland, the retailer bought earlier this year by South Africa's Steinhoff International. Steinhoff had been 
Sainsbury's rival in bidding for Home Retail Group, the owner of catalogue and high-street retailer Argos.

from GBP227.0 million a year before.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has questioned FBI director James Comey's clearing of rival 
Hillary Clinton of any illegality regarding recently uncovered emails. Speaking at a campaign rally at Sterling 
Heights in the US state of Michigan on Sunday evening, Trump claimed that "a rigged system" was protecting the 
Democratic presidential candidate. Earlier Sunday, the director of the FBI said his agency had not changed its 
opinion formed in July, that Hillary Clinton shouldn't face criminal charges for using a private email server while she 
was secretary of state. A nationwide poll released Sunday by broadcaster ABC and the Washington Post showed 
Clinton with a lead of 5 percentage points going into the final hours of the long campaign. Another poll by 
broadcaster NBC and the Wall Street Journal showed her with a 4-point lead nationwide.
----------
UK house prices increased at a slower pace in October, data published by the mortgage lender Halifax showed. In 
three months to October, house prices climbed 5.2% from previous year, following a 5.8% rise in three months to 
September. October's 5.2% was the lowest yearly growth rate since July 2013. "This expected slowdown appears 
to have been largely due to mounting affordability pressures, which have increasingly constrained housing 
demand," Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist, said.
----------
UK Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear she is not ready to back down on new immigration controls in any 
parliamentary Brexit battle. Speaking as she arrived in India on a three-day trade visit, the Prime Minister insisted 
the government has a "strong" case to persuade Supreme Court judges to overturn last week's High Court decision 
that MPs and peers should vote on the launch of EU withdrawal talks. And she gave short shrift to suggestions that 
Parliament might tie her hands by requiring her to make continued single market membership her priority during 
withdrawal talks under Article 50 of the European treaties.
----------
May is visiting India with the aim of boosting ties with one of the world's fastest growing economies, as her 
government looks at reworking relations in the context of a planned exit from the EU. May, who arrived in New Delhi 
late Sunday, is scheduled to begin the day with a speech at the UK-India Tech Summit in New Delhi which is 
showcasing technological innovations by British companies. Leading a 40-member business delegation, May is 
later scheduled to hold talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
----------
UK private sector growth ticked up in the three months to the end of October, with the economy expected to 
continue growing at a "healthy pace" in the next three months, the Confederation of British Industry said. The CBI's 
Growth Indicator, a survey of 764 businesses in the UK, showed a +8% reading compared to +3% for the three 
months to the end of September. However, the survey showed a mixed private sector performance. Output 
continued to rise at a "robust pace" in manufacturing and distribution during the recent period. However, activity 
within consumer services remained flat, and there was only a slight growth in business and professional services.
----------
UK manufacturers are set to cut back on investment plans in the next two years because of increased uncertainty 
following the EU referendum vote, a new study shows. A survey of more than 300 companies by the EEF, the UK 
manufacturing industry trade body, found that three out of five were planning to spend the same or less on plant 
and machinery, an increase on previous years. Uncertainty over future orders was the main reason affecting 
confidence, with some business leaders blaming political uncertainty.
----------
Britain's economic recovery is at risk if it ends up with a so-called hard Brexit from the European Union, a respected 
think-tank has warned. High levels of immigration and foreign capital helped the UK bounce back more quickly than 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Markets Rally As Clinton Gets US Election Boost
single currency nations after the 2008 crash, Chatham House said. A divorce settlement that curbed migration and 
investment flows would jeopardise future prosperity, according to its report.
----------
British Justice Minister Liz Truss defended the country's High Court over its decision on Brexit, saying the 
independence of the judiciary is the "foundation upon which our rule of law is built". Truss' comments follow 
widespread condemnation by some members of the ruling Conservative party as well as sections of the media in 
the wake of the ruling on Thursday that British Prime Minister Theresa May must seek parliamentary approval 
before she begins negotiations on Britain leaving the EU, or Brexit.
----------
The biggest train drivers' union has suspended a strike ballot it had just started among its members on Southern 
Railway because of "technical difficulties". Aslef had asked its members if they wanted to take industrial action in a 
dispute over driver-only trains. The result of the ballot was due within two weeks, raising the threat of strikes at the 
end of the month. Southern still faces a series of strikes in the coming weeks by the Rail, Maritime and Transport 
union in the bitter dispute over the role of conductors. The latest 48-hour walkout ended on Saturday night, with 
further stoppages planned later this month, early December, in the run up to Christmas and over new year.
----------
The UK is expected to shiver through another chilly week after air moving in from the Arctic sent temperatures 
dwindling down to single digits over the weekend. London barely exceeded 7C on Sunday while at Benson, 
Oxfordshire, about an hour out of the city, the mercury even dropped to -2.3C. Meanwhile, the first snow of the cold 
season fell in northern parts of the country including North Yorkshire and caused traffic headaches on a roadway 
near Nenthead, Cumbria.
----------
China barred two democratically elected Hong Kong lawmakers from taking their seats in a move that demonstrated 
"firm determination and will in opposing Hong Kong independence," state media reported. The Youngspiration party 
candidates are banned for their refusal to pledge allegiance to China and cannot retake their oaths, according to the 
newly adopted interpretation of an article in the Hong Kong constitution.
----------
Members of the Bank of Japan's monetary policy board said the country's economic recovery was continuing at a 
satisfactory pace, the minutes from the bank's September 20 and 21 meeting revealed. Inflation is trending higher, 
although it's been slightly weaker in recent months, the bank said - adding that exports and production are likely to 
remain sluggish in the near term. Risks to the economic outlook include Britain's withdrawal from the EU, US 
monetary policy and the health of the Chinese economy.
----------
Germany's factory orders contracted unexpectedly in September largely due to a fall in domestic demand, figures 
from Destatis showed. Factory orders fell 0.6% in September from August, when it grew by revised 0.9%. Orders 
were forecast to grow 0.2%. According to previous report, orders had expanded 1% in August.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets ended the first session of the new trading week with a strong 
gain. Following the weak performance of the previous week, the markets jumped in early trade and settled into a 
sideways trend for the rest of the session. Banks stocks turned in a strong performance following a solid earnings 
report from HSBC. 
Airlines were also among the gainers after a strong report from Ryanair.
Investors cheered the news that the FBI has once again cleared US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton of criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while Secretary of State.
"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary 
Clinton," FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter sent to members of Congress on Sunday.
Late last month, Comey revealed that the FBI re-opened its probe of Clinton after learning of the existence of new 
emails on a device obtained in connection with an unrelated investigation.
US officials familiar with the case said told the Washington Post the new emails were either personal or duplicative 
of those found earlier.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 1.41%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
increased 1.85%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, added 1.45%.

1.70% and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 1.87%.

In London, HSBC Holding climbed 4.62% after the lender reported a third-quarter pre-tax profit that beat analysts' 
estimates.

achieved the highest average price per carat since the tender began in 1984.
Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings jumped 4.97% after reporting a 7% increase in half yearly after tax profits, and 
lifting its long-term traffic growth forecast by 10%.
PostNL rallied 3.80% in Amsterdam after the postal company rejected a raised takeover offer from Belgian rival 
Bpost.
Eurozone investor confidence strengthened to a 11-month high in November, survey data from Sentix showed 
Monday. The Sentix investor confidence index rose to 13.1 from 8.5 in October. The score was well above the 
expected level of 8.9.
Eurozone retail sales annual growth slowed for a second straight month in September to mark its weakest pace in 
two years, preliminary data from Eurostat showed Monday. Retail sales grew a calendar adjusted 1.1% year-on-
year following 1.2% increase in August, revised sharply from 0.6%. Economists had forecast a gain of 1.2%.
German factory orders contracted unexpectedly in September, largely reflecting weak domestic demand and orders 
from euro area, figures from Destatis showed Monday. Factory orders fell 0.6% in September from August, when 
they grew by a revised 0.9%. This was the first fall in three months and the biggest since April. Orders were 
forecast to grow 0.2%.
Germany's construction sector expanded at the fastest pace in six months in October, driven by solid growth in 
housing and commercial activity, survey figures from IHS Markit showed Monday. The construction Purchasing 
Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 52.9 in October from 52.4 in the previous month.
UK house prices increased at a slower pace in October, data published by the mortgage lender Halifax showed 
Monday.
In three months to October, house prices climbed 5.2% from previous year, following a 5.8% rise in three months to 
September. October's 5.2% was the lowest yearly growth rate since July 2013.
The UK private sector growth picked up in the three months to October, the latest growth indicator from the 
Confederation of British Industry showed Sunday. The growth indicator rose to +8% from +3% in three months to

LONDON (Alliance News) - The downward earnings momentum facing low-cost airlines is close to bottoming out 
and easyJet has been hit the hardest in the sector, yet its strategic position remains strong, HSBC said.
HSBC said the market for short-haul airlines in Europe remains challenging and "structural instability" in the low-
cost carrier sector has continued. 
Central and Eastern Europe-focused Wizz Air Holdings and Scandinavia's Norwegian are both absorbing significant 
fleet deliveries. Meanwhile, the likes of Germany's Eurowings, Spain's Vueling, and Holland's Transavia are all 
targeting the "bronze medal" in the pan-Europe low-cost industry, behind easyJet and Ireland's Ryanair Holdings.
However, HSBC said these challenges are "widely understood". This, however, is not the case for flag carriers and 
the increasing competition they face in the key profit-generating North American market. As a result, the bank 
continues to prefer the low-cost airlines to the flag carriers.
In 2017, HSBC said both easyJet and Ryanair will benefit from significant fuel price improvements, in contrast to 
their competitors in the low-cost space whose fuel hedging has been the benefit from falling prices already.
Long-term, the solid strategic positions and robust balance sheets for easyJet and Ryanair will make them the 
winners in the market, despite current short-term commercial and operational challenges facing easyJet.
easyJet has trimmed its profit forecasts for the year to the end of September 2016 three times, driven primarily by 
the fall in the value of the pound. Pound weakness is an issue for UK airlines as it reduces the fares in euro terms 
on routes to and from the UK.
HSBC said easyJet currently trades at 9.2 times 2017 earnings estimates, a 21% discount to Ryanair and an 18% 
discount to easyJet's five-year average multiple.
The bank added that should easyJet fail to turn things around, it reckons some peers could be interest in making a 
bid for the firm given its strong strategic position, network and brand.
IN THE KNOW: easyJet And Ryanair Will Win Low-Cost War Long-Term
HSBC double-upgraded easyJet to Buy from Reduce and hiked its target price on the stock to 1,150 pence from 
800p. The bank also upgraded Ryanair, up to Hold from Reduce, and pushed its price target up to EUR12.00 from 
EUR8.00.
easyJet shares were up 2.9% to 967.75p on Wednesday, one of the best performers in the FTSE 100. Shares in 
Ryanair were up 1.2% at EUR12.88.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
on Wednesday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
Next, up 3.9%. The clothing and homewares retailer revised down its guidance for full-year sales and profit as it 
reported lower full-price sales in the third quarter of its financial year. 
The group said full-price sales in the third quarter to the end of October fell by 3.5% year-on-year, as retail sales 
dropped by 5.9% and sales from the directory business remained flat. Next narrowed its sales guidance for the full 
year to the end of January to between a fall of 1.75% and growth of 1.25%. Its previous guidance was for between 
a fall of 2.5% and growth of 2.5%. Next noted that the mid-point of its new sales range - a fall of 0.25% - is 
"marginally lower" than the previous guidance - which would have been flat. Shore Capital said trading in 
September was challenging, as expected, but the worst-performing month in the quarter was actually August. This 
was attributed by Next to a larger-than-usual end-of-season sale in July. Peer Marks & Spencer Group was also up 
1.4%. 
easyJet, up 3.0%. The low-cost carrier was upgraded by HSBC to Buy from Reduce. In addition, the threat of 
strikes by easyJet pilots over concerns about fatigue has ended after they accepted new proposals from the airline, 
a union said late on Tuesday. The British Airline Pilots' Association said its members voted by 68% to 32% to 
accept the Luton-based carrier's offer. Peer Ryanair was up 1.9% after announcing plans to open a new base in 
Frankfurt.
WINNERS & LOSERS SUMMARY: G4S Shares Surge On Robust Sales, Contracts
Persimmon, up 1.0%. The housebuilder said customer activity has strengthened in line with traditional seasonality, 
as its reported encouraging trading during the summer months. Persimmon said the number of customer visiting its 
sites in the weeks immediately following the European Union referendum at the end of June was well ahead of the 
prior year. Its private sales rate in the period between August 23 and November 1 was 19% ahead of the same 
period a prior year, the group said, representing a continuation of the stronger sales Persimmon experienced 
through the summer weeks.
----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
----------
Standard Chartered, down 5.0%. The emerging-markets focused bank was extending its losses from Tuesday as 
cost-cutting and asset disposals failed to translate into materially higher profit, and income continued to lag. The 
stock closed down 5.4%. Berenberg removed StanChart from its "Alpha List" but kept the lender at Buy.
----------
FTSE 250 - WINNERS
----------
G4S, up 8.3%. The security services company said it delivered robust growth in the first nine months of the year 
and remains confident on its prospects. The company said it has won new contracts with annual revenue totalling 
GBP1.00 billion since the start of 2016, with those contracts worth a total of GBP2.00 billion across their terms. 
Revenue from the group's continuing operations in the first nine months of 2016, to the end of September, was 
GBP4.82 billion, up 5.7% year-on-year.
Smurfit Kappa Group, up 3.8%. The Irish corrugated packaging company said its profit and revenue grew in the 
third quarter and it remains on track for the full year 2016. Smurfit said it made a pretax profit of EUR187.0 million in 
the quarter to the end of September, up 13% from EUR165.0 million a year earlier. For the nine months to the end 
of September, pretax profit grew 22% to EUR499.0 million from EUR408.0 million the year before.
NCC Group, up 1.6%. N+1 Singer upgraded the cyber security, consulting and managed services provider to Buy 
From Hold. The broker said recent share price weakness presents an compelling investment opportunity and that 
NCC remains a fundamentally attractive asset. "We see this share price weakness as a rare opportunity to gain 
access to the space and expect investor confidence in NCC to return in the coming months," N+1 said.
----------
FTSE 250 - LOSERS
----------
JD Wetherspoon, down 6.1%. The pub chain reported growth in sales in the first quarter of its financial year, but 
warned that forecasts for the full year are "tentative" as sales growth slowed in the latter part of the quarter, it said it 
anticipates booking higher costs in the year on the whole and its debt level increased. The company said like-for-
like sales in the 13 weeks ended October 23 grew by 3.5% year-on-year, while total sales rose by 2.3%. However, 
like-for-like sales growth slowed to 2.3% in the last five weeks of the period. Wetherspoon added it intends to 
increase the level of capital investment in existing pubs to GBP60 million in the full year from GBP34 million the 
prior year, while also anticipating higher costs relating to wages, business rates and repairs. 
Just Eat, down 2.9%. The online takeaway platform increased its revenue and adjusted earnings guidance for 2016, 
despite a slowdown in growth in the third quarter. Just Eat said reported orders grew 34% in the quarter to the end 
of September, a slowdown on the 55% growth reported in the first half of the year. Just Eat increased its full-year 
constant currency revenue guidance to GBP371.0 million from GBP368.0 million previously and increased its 
guidance for adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to between GBP109 million and 
GBP111 million, up from GBP106 million to GBP108 million previously.

Victoria Oil & Gas, up 4.7%. The oil and gas company said the La-107 and La-108 development wells at the 
Logbaba gas field in Cameroon have been spud. The wells are being drilled in order to meet growing demand in 
Douala, where the Logbaga field is based. The drilling is scheduled to complete in the second quarter of 2017. 
Victoria said the cost of the two wells will be around USD40.0 million, to be funded by revenue and partner 
contributions.

MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS

Pires Investments, down 17% at 3.10p. The investment company said it has raised GBP525,000 from a placing of

discount to their mid-market closing price of 3.75p on Tuesday. Pires also noted that placees will receive one 
warrant for every two placing shares subscribed for, with an exercise price of 4.52p each and an exercisable period 
of 18 months from the date of issue. 
Sirius Minerals, down 14% at 31.82p. The miner said it launched a comprehensive financing plan to enable it to

it will launch a firm placing, placing and open offer, priced at between 20.00p to 30.00p and conducted via an 
accelerated bookbuild, to raise between GBP330.0 million and GBP400.0 million. The company plans to raise 
around 90% of the gross proceeds of the firm placing, and placing and open offer through the underwritten firm 
placing to institutional investors. The remaining 10% will be subject to clawback by existing shareholders by way of 
an open offer.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday announced plans to open a 
new base at Frankfurt am Main airport in March 2017.
The base will hold two aircraft at an investment of USD200 million, and will provide four new routes to Alicante, 
Malaga and Palma in Spain and Faro in Portugal, with 28 weekly flights across the board.
Ryanair said this will attract over 400,000 customers a year to Frankfurt am Main airport, and said it is the first low-
cost airline to open a base there. The airport is the biggest in Germany and the main home of Germany's largest 
airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
"We look forward to working closely with Fraport to deliver industry leading efficiencies and further growth at 
Germany's biggest airport," Chief Commercial Officer David O'Brien said in a statement.
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 2.1% at EUR13.00 on Wednesday morning.

Ryanair Criticises UK Plans To Only Expand Heathrow Airport
Ryanair Criticises UK Plans To Only Expand Heathrow Airport

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday criticised the UK government's 
approval of a third runway at Heathrow, saying it should "stop dithering" and approve a "three-runway solution" at 
each of London's Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports.
Ryanair's statement came shortly after the UK government approved the construction of a third runway at Heathrow 
on Tuesday morning.
Ryanair, which has long campaigned for airport expansions in London, said Tuesday's decision will allow Heathrow 
to "waste" over GBP18 billion on construction of the third runway, an "excessive monopoly cost that will have to be 
paid for in higher fares for many years to come".
The airline added that by the time the third runway is open in 2025, it will already be full at peak periods, meaning 
another runway, or two, in the south east will be necessary.
Ryanair said the addition of three competing runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted would allow competition 
to encourage the airports to keep the costs of the runway developments down, "thereby providing a better solution 
for UK consumers and visitors" through competitive airport fees and lower air fares.
"This piecemeal approach to runway infrastructure in the south east is damaging British tourism and the 
competitiveness of London airports. Approving a third runway at Heathrow over Gatwick is not the way forward. 
London now benefits from three competing airports, and three large competing airlines and the best way to deliver 
additional runways in a timely and cost efficient manner is to approve three additional runways, one each at 
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
"The threat of additional runways at competitor airports will force Heathrow to keep its costs down while developing 
a third runway in the most timely and efficient manner," he added.
Shares in Ryanair were trading flat at EUR12.70 on Tuesday afternoon.

LONDON (Alliance News) - On The Beach Group should accrue further confidence amongst investors when it 
launches a new site in Norway, Berenberg said, after the online beach holiday firm said its underlying profit for the 
year to the end of September should be marginally ahead of market expectations.
"While travel peers including EasyJet, Ryanair and Thomas Cook have served a series of warnings in recent 
months, On The Beach has announced this morning that it expects earnings to be ahead of market expectations for 
the full year," said Berenberg analyst Owen Shirley.
The online beach holiday retailer said it traded well in a "difficult" market in the year ended September 30, with 
slower-than-expected revenue growth in the UK of 12% to GBP70 million from GBP62.5 million the year before.
However, On the Beach said it continued to grow market share, with daily unique visitors to the site increasing by 
13% to 61 million from 54.4 million.
Shares in On The Beach were up 4.3% at 219.00 pence on Tuesday morning. Berenberg retained a Buy 
recommendation on the shares and a price target of 335.00p. 
"On The Beach provides the rare combination of impressive cash generation, strong growth and high barriers to 
entry," said Shirley. "Despite uncertainty arising from the Brexit vote, we see cause for optimism in 2017."
Since its last trading update in July, On the Beach said demand for beach holidays has remained resilient despite 
the impact of terrorist attacks and the weakening of sterling.
On the Beach added that it will launch its second international website before the end of 2016, after the successful 
launch of its Swedish website in January. The new site will be in Norway.
"This should only help build investor confidence on the long-term vision that On The Beach can be a substantially 
larger business not just in the UK, but in time more broadly across Europe," Shirley noted.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UBS cut its earnings forecasts for Ryanair Holdings after the Irish budget airline 
lowered its full-year guidance last week.
Last week, Ryanair said it now expects net profit in the year ending March 31 to be between EUR1.30 billion and 
EUR1.35 billion, having previously guided a range of EUR1.38 billion to EUR1.43 billion. The new guidance 
represents a 7% increase on the prior year's net profit.
The airline said this was as as result of the depreciation of sterling since the UK's vote to leave the EU in June.
UBS said it was not surprised by the lowered guidance, "given the pound devaluation and previous management 
comments", which led it to cut its own net income forecast to EUR1.32 billion. The broker also reduced its earnings 
per share forecast by 7% for financial 2017 and financial 2018.
UBS downgraded its price target to EUR15.50 from EUR16.25, but retained its Buy recommendation on the stock, 
on the grounds that Ryanair "continues to take market share", has "very attractive cash generation characteristics", 
is trading at an "attractive valuation multiple", while digital initiatives "should add materially to long-term value".
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 1.7% at EUR12.76 on Monday afternoon.

easyJet, up 2.4%. The low-cost carrier was upgraded to Buy from Neutral by UBS. "We see easyJet as one of the 
"best of breed" low-cost carriers in Europe and think LCCs and easyJet will continue to take market share from flag 
carrier operators. While cost control has not been as strong as Ryanair we think that easyJet has scope to further 
reduce costs. We think earnings risk to 2017 is now neutral," the Swiss bank said. British Airways-owner 
International Consolidated Airlines Group was up 1.6%. 
----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS

Royal Bank of Scotland Group, down 2.0%. Investec downgraded the state-backed lender to Sell from Hold, as the 
broker thinks "RBS now faces a potentially even less favourable environment" following allegations against the 
bank's Global Restructuring Group earlier in October. RBS said it "could, and should, have done better" in relation 
to claims that its GRG unit deliberately squeezed small firms for cash when it was supposed to be helping them to

comprising private equity firms and the Church of England has been paid at least GBP180.0 million by RBS for 
backing the bank's aborted attempt to float its Williams & Glyn business. The initial public offering of Williams & 
Glyn was scrapped in August, with RBS saying it has spent around GBP1.50 billion over seven years trying to spin-
off the business but would now seek to sell it instead.

Petra Diamonds, up 6.5%. The diamond miner said production in the first quarter of its financial year grew by a third 
year-on-year and it generated revenue, having not held a diamond sale a year before. The company said 
production in the first quarter to the end of September was 1.1 million carats, up 30% from the 842,796 carats it 
produced a year prior. This was driven by improved grades and additional tailings production from the Kimberley 
Ekapa mine. Revenue for the period was USD94.7 million with 745,447 carats sold. Petra did not hold a diamond 
sale in the first quarter of its prior financial year. The stock also was upgraded to Buy from Hold by Panmure 
Gordon.

Cobham, down 18%. The defence and aerospace technology company said trading in the third quarter has 
remained challenging and was behind its expectations, meaning its results for 2016 are set to miss its forecasts. 
Cobham said the underperformance has been driven by soft trading in its satellite communications and wireless 
business units and in the Electronic Solutions arm of its Advanced Electronic Solutions unit. Cobham anticipates an 
uptick in trading in the fourth quarter but said the softness in the third will mean full-year results miss its previous 
expectations. Cobham's second warning of 2016 indicated profit to be 9% below the consensus estimate, according 
to UBS, as the company said the same problems which hampered its performance in the first quarter dragged on.

Legendary Investments, up 50%. The investment company said its Virtualstock portfolio company has won a 
contract to provide its technology platform to a group of National Health Service training hospitals. Virtualstock has 
been appointed by the Shelford Group, which comprises 10 training hospitals in the UK, to deploy its The Edge 
cloud-based catalogue management platform. The platform is designed to improve procurement and optimise 
supply chains. No financial details on the contract were disclosed. Legendary owns a 7.0% stake in Virtualstock. "In 
a few short years, Virtualstock has gone from winning its landmark contract with Tesco to being adopted by other 
leading retailers. Momentum in this sector continues to grow," said Legendary Executive Chairman Zafar Karim.
Frontera Resources, up 32%. The oil and gas explorer said six new wells have been prepared at its its South 
Kakheti gas complex in Georgia and will shortly receive stimulation completions in November. The company said 
the preparation of the wells comes follows extensive workover operations throughout October and the procurement 
of necessary materials. Frontera said the upcoming campaign in Georgia is expected to "significantly contribute" 
towards its current objective of achieving overall year-end pilot production rates of 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day. This would result in monthly revenue of around USD3.0 million at current commodity prices.
Fusionex International, up 18%. The analytics software company said it expects its full year earnings to beat market 
expectations after a successful second half of its financial year. Fusionex said that for its financial year ended 
September 30, its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation are expected to be "significantly 
ahead of market expectations". The company said it anticipates revenue to be in line with market expectations. 
Fusionex highlighted the launch of its big data analytics platform GIANT 2016 in June as opening a new market in 
small and medium sized businesses and said the business pipeline for the platform is "substantial".

Sunrise Resources, down 21%. The miner said a "number of technical challenges" have hindered its drill 
programme at the Bay State silver project in Nevada, US. Sunrise said the most recent underground sampling 
confirmed the high grade of material left behind in the Chihuahua Vein, and said the vein system was present at 
300 metres from surface. This is below both the level of all historical workings and the lowest level of previous 
drilling. Alongside this, the vein system was silver-bearing at the 300-metre depth as well. However, Sunrise noted 
the technical challenges of the project which, although mostly resolved during the programme, affected the results.

Avocet Mining, down 18%. The gold miner said gold from the Inata mine in Burkina Faso was seized earlier this 
month by bailiffs acting on behalf of ex-workers of the mine owner. Avocet said a gold shipment containing around 
1,400 ounces was seized by bailiffs on October 7. The legal basis for the seizure was said to be a claim made by 
ex-workers of Societe des Mines de Belahouro, the owner of the Inata mine, which Avocet operates. Though a 
court upheld the claim of pay due to the former workers, SMB has said the claim would be for substantially less 
than the USD3.4 million of gold seized. SMB has maintained the seizure itself was "illegal" and a court hearing is 
due to take place on Monday. No gold shipments will be made from the site until SMB is confident none of the gold 
will be seized.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
on Thursday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
International Consolidated Airlines Group, up 2.9%, easyJet, up 2.1%. The airline stocks were higher following a 
positive trading update from Lufthansa. The German airline reported adjusted earnings before interest and tax of 
EUR1.68 billion in the first nine months of 2016 compared to EUR1.69 billion in the previous year. Based on 
preliminary figures, the company generated revenues of EUR23.9 billion in the first nine months of 2016 compared 
to EUR24.3 billion in the prior-year period. Lufthansa increased its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings before 
interest and tax from 'below previous year' to 'approximately on previous year's level'. Midcap carrier Wizz Air 
Holdings was also up 1.9% and Irish airline Ryanair Holdings was up 3.0%. 
London Stock Exchange Group, up 0.9%. The exchange operator said its total income grew in the third quarter of 
2016 thank to good trading across the business, though its focus remains on its merger with German peer 
Deutsche Boerse. LSE said total income for the third quarter to the end of September including continuing 
operations was GBP414.6 million, up 19% year-on-year. Revenue for the company, from its trading operations, was 
GBP376.2 million, up 15% year-on-year. For the nine months to the end of September, LSE said total income grew 
14% year-on-year to GBP1.20 billion, while revenue was GBP1.10 billion, up 11%.
Rio Tinto, up 0.6%. The Anglo-Australian mining giant reported that Pilbara iron ore production for the third-quarter 
increased 2%, while iron ore shipments declined 5%. It cut its 2016 expectations for Pilbara iron ore shipments. Rio 
Tinto, the world's second-largest iron-ore producer, said its Pilbara iron ore production for the third-quarter 
increased 2% to 83.2 million tons reflecting productivity improvements and continued ramp-up of expanded mines

across its Pilbara operations. Pilbara iron ore shipments for the quarter decreased 5% to 80.9 million tons, due 
primarily to rail maintenance and of the Cape Lambert ship loader.

ITV, down 3.8% at 173.00 pence. Jefferies slashed its price target on the broadcaster to 195 pence from 310p.

FTSE 250 - WINNERS
----------
International Personal Finance, up 14%. The sub-prime lender said there was a strong increase in its amount of 
credit issued in the third quarter and impairments were towards the bottom end of its target range, although 
elevated impairment levels in its Mexico business are set to continue. The firm reported a 9% growth in its credit 
issued in the three months to the end of September. The home-collected credit business delivered a 5% increase 
while the company's digital business produced 44% growth. Customer numbers increased by 1% during the 
quarter. IPF said impairment as a percentage of revenue was at 26.1%, towards the bottom-end of its target range 
of 25% to 30%. However the company noted that the annualised impairment levels in its Mexico business are at a 
similar level to June and are likely to remain at an elevated level for the remainder of the year. IPF said it expects to 
see continued growth and "stable" credit quality in the fourth quarter. 
Laird, up 4.2%. Shares in the wireless components company were rebounding after losing almost half their value 
following a profit warning on Wednesday. The stock closed down 49% that day. 
----------
FTSE 250 - LOSERS
----------
NCC Group, down 35%. The software escrow and verification, cyber security consulting and managed services 
provider said revenue in the first four months of its current financial year surged higher, but said its results will have 
a bias to the second half due to issues faced in its Assurance division. In the four months to the end of September, 
NCC revenue grew 36% year-on-year to GBP79.6 million. Stripping out foreign exchange translation and 
acquisition contributions, organic revenue was up 21%. Consequently N+1 Singer downgraded NCC to Hold From 
Buy, while Shore Capital put its Buy recommendation Under Review. "Management state that guidance is being 
retained for the present, but we anticipate a need for caution, likely leading to downgrades to our numbers. Clearly, 
a lack of visibility is set to weigh on the share price," Shore noted. 
Keller Group, down 27%. The geotechnical contractor said its results for 2016 will miss market expectations due to 
weakness in its Asia Pacific business. Keller said its North America and Europe, Middle East & Africa units 
delivered steady results in the third quarter to the end of September, with trading in the US and Europe was strong 
and on track for the full year. In Asia-Pacific, however, Keller said it made further operating losses in the third 
quarter as conditions in the region remained tough, both on contract awards and pricing. Keller said a recovery for 
the unit is now anticipated to be "more gradual and protracted" than previous envisaged. Keller now expects its 
underlying results for 2016 will be around 15% lower than current market estimates.
Senior, down 16%. The aerospace, military and vehicle components manufacturer issued a profit warning as the 
ongoing problems in its Flexonics divisions were exacerbated by a slower-than-expected ramp-up of new 
programmes for its Aerospace business in the third quarter. Senior which also had issued a profit warning in June, 
said activity in the large commercial aircraft and regional jets market for its Aerospace business improved in the 
third quarter. However, while bid activity is high and the unit secured important new contracts in the quarter to the 
end of September, Senior said trading for the Aerospace Division was below its expectations due to slower ramp-
ups on new production programmes and by certain supplier issues which have hit its operations in the UK and the 
US. Senior said it does anticipate some improvement in the fourth quarter against the third, but its results for the full 
year will fall below its previous expectations.

----------
Georgian Mining Corp, up 33%. The miner said drilling at the Kvemo Bolnisi project has intercepted "additional 
significant" near-surface copper and gold sulphide mineralisation. The Kvemo Bolnisi site is located in south 
Georgia. The Georgia-focused base company, which changed its name from Noricum Gold last month, said nine 
out of ten drill holes in the programme intersected significant zones of mineralisation. The company's current drill 
programme tested a footprint of 100 metres by 150 metres, to over a 150 metre depth in a bid to verify the high 
grade copper assay results from its local partner's 2008 drill programme.
IXICO, up 23%. The brain medicine developer said it has signed a USD1.2 million contract with an unnamed 
leading pharmaceutical firm. IXICO said the contract will cover the use of its TrialTracker and Assessa digital 
platforms in a trial of advanced imaging systems in treating progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare 
neurodegenerative disease. Progressive supranuclear palsy is a Parkinson's-like neurological condition caused by 
the premature loss of nerve cells in certain parts of the brain.
Lombard Risk Management, up 14%. The regulatory reporting services firm said its revenue grew strongly in the 
first half of its financial year and narrowed its pretax loss. Lombard reported a pretax loss of GBP100,000 for the six 
months to September 30, narrowed from GBP1.8 million year on year. Revenue increased by 41% to GBP15.2 
million from GBP10.8 million. Annually recurring revenue for the company was up 22% to GBP6.1 million from 
GBP5.0 million. Sales were up 58% with software licence sales more than doubling. The company's cash at the end 
of the period stood at GBP6.9 million compared with GBP2.7 million at the same date the year prior. Lombard Risk 
said current trading is in line with management expectations.

GB Group, down 13%. The identity data company it performed well in the half-year to the end of September but 
said the roll-out of a project with the UK government was slower than originally forecast. GB said revenue for the six 
months to September 30 was GBP37.5 million, up 16% year-on-year. Organic revenue growth, excluding 
acquisitions, was 9.0%, GB said. It said this would have been higher but for the roll out of the gov.uk Verify project 
across UK central government departments, which progressed at a slower pace than originally expected. GB said it 
expects profit for the first half to be in line with its expectations.
Hayward Tyler Group, down 11%. The engineer said it remains confident of meeting market expectations for the full 
year. The company said it continues to see its full-year results, to the end of March 2017, being weighted to the 
second half but still anticipates making revenue of around GBP80.0 million for the full year. This would compare to 
GBP61.6 million for financial 2016. In the first half to the end of September, revenue was GBP22.5 million, up from 
GBP21.8 million a year before thanks to a robust order book going into its current financial year. Hayward Tyler's 
order book at September 30 was GBP48.0 million, up from GBP36.1 million at the end of March 2016.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday lowered its full-year profit guidance on the 
weakening of the pound since the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
The Irish low-cost airline said it now expects net profit in its financial 2017 year to be between EUR1.30 billion and 
EUR1.35 billion, having previously guided a range of EUR1.38 billion to EUR1.43 billion. The new guidance 
represents a 7% increase on the prior year's net profit.
Ryanair's financial year ends on March 31, 2017.
Ryanair said the reduced guidance is a result of sterling's decline against other currencies since the Brexit vote, 
which will reduce average second-half fares by between 13% and 15%. It had previously expected average fares to 
fall by between 10% and 12%. Sterling-based revenue accounts for around 26% of Ryanair's overall revenue.
The airline added that first-half fares were down by 10%, compared to its forecast of 9%, but noted that this will be 
offset by a better-than-expected cost performance. It now expects full-year unit costs excluding fuel to decline by 
3%, having previously guided a 1% fall.
In addition, Ryanair expects full-year load factor to be one percentage point better than guided at 94%, while traffic 
should increase to 119 million customers, which is up 12% on the prior year's 106 million.
"We would caution that this revised guidance remains heavily dependent upon no further weakness in second-half 
fares or sterling from its current levels," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The small profit warning announced by Ryanair on Tuesday was "not a surprise" for 
analysts, as most brokers were already expecting a cut to profit guidance after the budget airline's management 
had warned that risk was on the downside. 
In September, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement that customers could look forward to 
lower fares. 
"As our recent guidance confirmed, Ryanair expects average fares to fall by between 10% to 12% in the six months 
to March 2017," O'Leary had noted a month ago.
The Irish low-cost airline said on Tuesday it now expects net profit in its financial 2017 year to be between EUR1.30 
billion and EUR1.35 billion, having previously guided a range of EUR1.38 billion to EUR1.43 billion. The new 
guidance still represents a 7% increase on the prior year's net profit. Ryanair's financial year ends on March 31, 
2017.
Ryanair said the reduced guidance is a result of sterling's decline against other currencies since the Brexit vote, 
which will reduce average second-half fares by between 13% and 15%. Sterling-based revenue accounts for 
around 26% of Ryanair's overall revenue.
Shares in Ryanair were up 2.7% at EUR12.13 on Tuesday. 
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said the cut to guidance was expected. "Management had previously indicated the 
risks to its guidance were on the downside, and our forecasts are already below consensus and in line with the new 
guidance range," said the analyst. 
"Consequently, today's revision to guidance should not come as a major surprise to the market. Our EUR1.336 
billion net profit forecast for financial 2017 is already consistent with the revised guidance range, although 
consensus appears to be in line with the bottom end of the old range," noted Khoo. 
IN THE KNOW: Ryanair's Cut To Guidance "Not A Surprise" For Analysts
The Liberum analyst said Bloomberg net profit consensus is at EUR1.374 billion.
Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde expects the consensus net profit estimate to fall by between 4% and 5%. The 
broker said its preferred airline stock is easyJet, with a Buy recommendation and a price target of 1,300.00p, 
compared to 903.00p currently. On Ryanair, Cantor kept a Hold stance and a price target of EUR12.50.
UBS analyst Jarrod Castle agreed the profit warning was "not a surprise". 
"We think now that the company has adjusted its guidance we could see relieve in that profits are still expected to 
grow above 2016 levels. Nevertheless, the yield environment over winter remains uncertain," said Castle. UBS kept 
a Buy recommendation and a price target EUR16.25 on Ryanair. 
Ryanair is scheduled to release interim results on November 7.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London opened higher on Tuesday, with investors digesting a feast of 
corporate news, while awaiting the release of UK inflation in the morning and the same from the US in the 
afternoon. 
The FTSE 100 was up 0.9%, or 59.69 points, at 6,907.24. The FTSE 250 index was up 0.9% at 17,955.11 and the 
AIM All-Share was up 0.1% at 826.99.
The BATS UK 100 index was up 1.0% at 11,850.86, the BATS 250 index was 0.9% higher at 16,322.82, and the 
BATS Small Companies was up 0.1% at 11,067.16.
Ryanair Holdings was down 0.5% after the Irish budget airline lowered its full-year profit guidance on the weakening 
of the pound since the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
Ryanair said it now expects net profit in its financial 2017 year to be between EUR1.30 billion and EUR1.35 billion, 
having previously guided a range of EUR1.38 billion to EUR1.43 billion. The new guidance represents a 7%

kept a Buy stance on the stock. 
"Ryanair is still the long-term winner in the European airline industry, tough trading conditions are an opportunity to 
make strategic progress at the expense of weaker competitors, and the valuation more than adequately reflects the 
uncertain economic outlook," noted Khoo. 
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Inflation Readings In Focus As Shares, Pound Rise
Gold miners Rangold Resources and Fresnillo were among the best blue-chip performers, up 2.6% and 2.2%. The 
stocks were tracking the precious metal's price higher, with gold quoted at USD1,261.30 an ounce at the equities 
open, compared to USD1,255.42 an ounce at the close on Monday.
Tesco shares were up 1.6%. Tesco consolidated its position as the UK's largest supermarket as it proved the only 
one of the big four grocers to report a rise in sales in the 12 weeks to October 9, Kantar Worldpanel figures showed. 
Tesco sales were up 1.3% year-on-year in the period, with its market share rising to 28.2% from 28.1% in the 
comparable period a year earlier. That is the first market share gain Tesco has registered in the Kantar report since 
2011. 
This compares to sales for J Sainsbury, the second-largest by market share in the UK, falling 0.4%. Its market 
share declined to 16.0% from 16.1%. Wm Morrison Supermarkets sales were down 3.0% and its market share was 
down to 10.4% from 10.8% a year earlier. 
Sainsbury's shares were up 0.6%, while Morrisons was down 0.5%. 
Vodafone Group was up 0.4% after the mobile telecoms giant said it has signed a non-equity partner-market 
agreement for Iran with HiWEB, a leading internet service provider in Iran. Vodafone will work with HiWEB on rolling 
out and modernising network and IT infrastructure for the Iranian company, plus expanding its fixed and mobile 
internet services.
Shares in Burberry Group were down 5.1%, despite the fashion house reported growth in revenue in the first half of 
its financial year. It said revenue was boosted by positive foreign exchange movements, and said full-year retail and 
wholesale profit, meaning excluding licensing, will benefit even more from those movements than previously 
expected, although underlying expectations remain unchanged.
Retail revenue grew by 11% at reported exchange rates and by 2% on an underlying basis to GBP859 million, but 
wholesale revenue fell by 14% on an underlying basis to GBP287 million and licensing revenue decreased by 54% 
to GBP13 million also on an underlying basis.
FTSE 250-listed betting shop owner William Hill was up 1.7%. Earlier this month, the bookie said it was in talks with 
Amaya about an all-share merger which would have created a company with a market capitalisation of around 
GBP4.60 billion. But on Tuesday, William Hill said that, after "canvassing views" from a number of shareholders, it 
had decided against pursuing the merger with Amaya. It said it has informed Amaya it will withdraw from the talks.
After the talks were revealed, Parvus Asset Management, which has a 14.3% stake in William Hill, came out 
publicly against the deal and instead suggested William Hill should consider putting itself up for sale. Parvus said 
the combination with Amaya had "limited strategic logic and would destroy shareholder value".
Elsewhere among mid-caps, Bellway was up 3.6%, after the housebuilder said its pretax profit rose 41% in its 
financial year ended July 31 after it sold more homes at a higher price, and said reservation levels following the 
referendum vote were ahead of the prior year.
AIM-listed ASOS was down 3.4%. The online fashion retailer reported a fall in profit in its recently-ended financial 
year due to exceptional costs it booked, but revenue rose and it said it looks forward to the new year with 
confidence.
In mainland Europe, the French CAC 40 index was up 0.8%, and the German DAX 30 started the day 0.6% higher.
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo ended up 0.4%, the Shanghai Composite closed 1.4% higher and the Hang Seng 
in Hong Kong continues up 1.5%.
In the economic calendar, UK consumer, retail and producer price inflation for September is at 0930 BST, while 
consumer price inflation from the US is at 1330 BST. The US NAHB housing market index is at 1500 BST.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Inflation Readings In Focus As Shares, Pound Rise
"The fall in the pound and the base effects from commodity prices are likely to exert upward pressure on [UK] 
inflation," said analysts at French bank Societe Generale.
UK consumer price inflation is expected to come in at 0.8% year-on-year, higher than the 0.6% rise seen in August, 
according to FXStreet.com. On a monthly basis, inflation is expected to edge up 0.1% compared to the 0.3% rise 
seen in August. Consensus expectations for core inflation are 1.4%, higher than the 1.3% seen a month ago.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.2237 on Tuesday morning, compared to USD1.2186 at the London equities close on 
Monday. The pound briefly hit a low around USD1.18 earlier this month - its lowest level since 1985 - in what 
analysts called a 'flash crash'.

company with a market capitalisation of around GBP4.60 billion. But on Tuesday, the FTSE 250-listed bookie said 
that, after "canvassing views" from a number of shareholders, it had decided against pursuing the merger with 
Amaya. It said it has informed Amaya it will withdraw from the talks.
After the talks were revealed, Parvus Asset Management, which has a 14.3% stake in William Hill, came out 
publicly against the deal and instead suggested William Hill should consider putting itself up for sale. Parvus said 
the combination with Amaya had "limited strategic logic and would destroy shareholder value".
Ryanair said it now expects net profit in its financial 2017 year to be between EUR1.30 billion and EUR1.35 billion, 
having previously guided a range of EUR1.38 billion to EUR1.43 billion. The new guidance represents a 7% 
increase on the prior year's net profit. Ryanair's financial year ends on March 31, 2017.
The Irish low-cost airline said the reduced guidance is a result of sterling's decline against other currencies since 
the Brexit vote, which will reduce average second-half fares by between 13% and 15%. It had previously expected 
average fares to fall by between 10% and 12%. Sterling-based revenue accounts for around 26% of Ryanair's 
overall revenue.
Mobile telecoms giant Vodafone Group said it has signed a non-equity partner-market agreement for Iran with 
HiWEB, a leading internet service provider in Iran. Vodafone will work with HiWEB on rolling out and modernising 
network and IT infrastructure for the Iranian company, plus expanding its fixed and mobile internet services.
HiWEB then will be able to provide Vodafone's multi-national business customers with fixed and mobile services in 
Iran.
The UK's government stake in Royal Bank of Scotland Group is to be sharply written down in the public accounts, 
the Financial Times reported on Monday. For the second time in six months, the Office for Budget Responsibility is 
preparing to recalculate the amount the government will be able to make from selling down its 73% stake in the 
lenders, acquired in the bailout of the bank in 2008.
The OBR cut its estimate by a quarter in March to GBP21.50 billion, but RBS shares were trading at 172.30 pence 
on Monday, down 44% so far in 2016, valuing the government's holding in the bank at just GBP14.80 billion.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Share prices in London and the pound both were higher early Tuesday, ahead of UK

retailer Target has removed clown masks from its shelves.
Meanwhile, luxury goods retailer Burberry was the biggest FTSE 100 faller, down 7.1%, as it reported a bigger-
than-expected currency gain but declining underlying revenue. Ryanair also lowered its full-year guidance and was 
down 0.7%.

The price of petrol in the UK has reached its highest level in over a year, new figures from roadside assistance 
company AA show. Data published by the AA showed that a litre of petrol hit an average of GBP1.15 on Sunday. 
This is the most expensive price since August last year. In March, the average price was just GBP1.02.

Tobacco giants return to court Tuesday in their battle against the UK government's new plain-packaging rules. They 
suffered what anti-smoking campaigners described as a ''crushing defeat'' at the High Court in May. The day before 
new regulations come into force, a judge in London declared that they were ''valid and lawful in all respects''. Philip 
Morris International, British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco International had challenged 
the legality of the ''standardised packaging'' regulations.

The former favourite to lead the UK Independence Party said he has left the right-wing party, claiming it is "riddled 
with infighting". "It is with deep sorrow and regret that I am aborting my leadership campaign and announcing my 
resignation from UKIP with immediate effect," Steven Woolfe said in a statement on his website. Woolfe, 49, a 
former lawyer, said the British party "is riddled with infighting, proxy wars between rival camps." Woolfe spent three 
days in a Strasbourg hospital after what interim party leader Nigel Farage called an "altercation" between Woolfe 
and Mike Hookem while the three men and other UKIP members of the European Parliament were meeting.

Members of the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy board figure the Australian economy will see a gradual

provided stability.

Hillary Clinton's campaign sees possibilities for the Democrat to gain ground in traditionally Republican states as 
polls show her widening her lead over Republican Donald Trump. First Lady Michelle Obama and other prominent 
Democratic figures will campaign this week for Clinton in Arizona, which hasn't supported a Democrat since Bill 
Clinton in 1996. The campaign said Monday it is spending more than USD100 million in key states in a bid to help 
candidates for Senate, the House of Representatives and governor's mansions, including in traditionally Republican 
Arizona, Missouri and Indiana. The campaign is also focusing spending on key swing states, including Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nevada.

Iraqi troops and Kurdish Peshmerga forces, backed by US-led air cover, advanced towards Mosul on the first day of 
an offensive aimed at recapturing the country's second-largest city from the Islamic State extremist organization. 
President Masoud Barzani of Iraqi Kurdistan, in a press conference held near front lines east of Mosul, said that the 
allied forces had already cleared some 200 square kilometres of land that were previously held by Islamic State.

Moscow has said it will carry out an eight-hour ceasefire to Russian and Syrian government air raids in and around 
Aleppo, in which at least 35 people were killed on Monday, according to a monitoring group. The "humanitarian 
pause" is intended to allow safe passage for civilians and the withdrawal of "militants" from rebel-held eastern 
Aleppo, General Sergei Rudskoi of the Russian General Staff said in comments quoted by the official TASS news 
agency.

Burberry Group reported growth in revenue in the first half of its financial year, boosted by positive foreign 
exchange movements, and said full-year retail and wholesale profit, meaning excluding licensing, will benefit even 
more from those movements than previously expected, although underlying expectations remain unchanged. The 
luxury fashion retailer said total revenue rose by 5% year-on-year in the six months to September 30 to GBP1.16 
billion, but fell by 4% on an underlying basis, which is at constant currencies. On an underlying basis, Burberry's 
full-year adjusted profit expectations remain unchanged.

Tesco has consolidated its position as the UK's largest supermarket as it proved the only one of the big four grocers 
to report a rise in sales in the 12 weeks to October 9, Kantar Worldpanel figures showed. Tesco sales were up 
1.3% year-on-year in the period, with its market share rising to 28.2% from 28.1% in the comparable period a year 
earlier. That is the first market share gain Tesco has registered in the Kantar report since 2011. This compares to 
sales for J Sainsbury, the second-largest by market share in the UK, falling 0.4%. Its market share declined to 
16.0% from 16.1%.
----------
Polymetal International reiterated its full-year production and cost guidance but said production in the first nine 
months of 2016 came in considerably lower than last year. The miner operating in Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia 
said it produced 372,000 ounces of gold equivalent in the third quarter of 2016, up 29% from the previous quarter 
but 5.0% lower than in the same period of the previous year.
----------
Royal Dutch Shell is facing questions over an important plank of its USD30.00 billion asset disposal programme as 
an acrimonious boardroom clash complicates its planned exit from a refining partnership in Japan, the Financial 
Times reported. Last year, Shell agreed to sell its 33% stake in Showa Shell for around USD1.60 billion to Idemitsu 
Kosan as part of efforts to reduce debt and streamline operations after its USD35.00 billion takeover of BG Group.

Bookmaker William Hill said it has withdrawn from talks to merge with Canada's Amaya Inc, after getting negative 
feedback from its shareholders on the deal. William Hill earlier this month said it was in talks with Amaya, which 
owns the Pokerstars online poker business, about an all-share merger which would have created a company with a 
market capitalisation of around GBP4.60 billion. But on Tuesday, William Hill said that, after "canvassing views" 
from a number of shareholders, it had decided against pursuing the merger with Amaya. It said it has informed 
Amaya it will withdraw from the talks.

Ladbrokes reported growth in revenue in the third quarter of 2016, boosted by favourable sporting events, and said 
it sees both significant opportunities and risks ahead. The bookmaker said net revenue in the three months to the 
end of September grew by 12% year-on-year, as retail net revenue rose by 1.9% and digital net revenue increased 
by 48%. Ladbrokes said this was its fourth consecutive quarter of group net revenue growth, boosted by growth in 
sportsbook staking. In particular, it highlighted a strong end to the Euro 2016 football tournament and a favourable 
start to the new football season for Manchester United and Barcelona.
----------
Recruitment company Hays said good growth in its Asia Pacific and European businesses offset a slump in activity 
in the UK & Ireland in the first quarter of its financial year. The firm said total net fee income rose 17% in the quarter 
to the end of September year-on-year, boosted significantly by translation of overseas income into the weak pound. 
Like-for-like net fees, in constant currencies, were up 3.0% in the quarter. But net fees slumped 10% in the UK & 
Ireland in the quarter, hit by a step down in permanent recruitment activity in the immediate aftermath of the UK's 
vote to leave the European Union.
----------
Bellway said its pretax profit rose 41% in its financial year ended July 31 after it sold more homes at a higher price, 
and said reservation levels following the referendum vote were ahead of the prior year. The housebuilder posted 
pretax profit of GBP497.9 million for the year, up from GBP354.2 million the prior year, as revenue rose 27% to 
GBP2.24 billion from GBP1.77 billion. Bellway hiked its total dividend for the year by 40% to 108.00 pence per 
share from 77.00p.

Ryanair Holdings lowered its full-year profit guidance on the weakening of the pound since the UK's vote to leave 
the European Union. The Irish low-cost airline said it now expects net profit in its financial 2017 year to be between 
EUR1.30 billion and EUR1.35 billion, having previously guided a range of EUR1.38 billion to EUR1.43 billion. The 
new guidance represents a 7% increase on the prior year's net profit. Ryanair's financial year ends on March 31, 
2017.
----------
ASOS Preported a fall in profit in its recently-ended financial year due to exceptional costs it booked, but revenue 
rose and it said it looks forward to the new year with confidence. The online fashion retailer said pretax profit in the 
year ended August 31 fell to GBP42.8 million from GBP52.7 million the year before, despite revenue rising to 
GBP1.44 billion from GBP1.14 billion. Profit was hit by exceptional costs of GBP6.5 million relating to the closure of 
its operations in China and GBP20.9 million in relation to the settlement of trademark infringement disputes.

At least two employees are dead while two people are missing and another six people have been severely injured 
following a violent explosion and fire on Monday at the world's biggest chemical company, BASF, in western 
Germany. Police have called on residents in the city of Ludwigshafen, where the sprawling BASF complex is 
located, and the nearby city of Mannheim to stay indoors and suggested they close all windows and doors and shut 
down air-conditioning and ventilation systems. The company said it was still seeking to determine the exact cause 
of the blast, which occurred during work on a pipeline route for transporting products for processing from the 
company's Rhine river port to production sites.
----------
French dairy giant Danone reported that its consolidated sales for the third-quarter were EUR5.537 billion, up 2.1% 
on like-for-like basis, reflecting a slight 0.7% decline in volume and a 2.8% rise in value. Reported sales were down 
1.8%, including changes in exchange rates (-4.1%) and in the scope of consolidation (+0.2%).
----------
International Business Machines reported a drop in profit for the third quarter, as revenue continued to decline, hurt 
largely by sharp drop in hardware sales. Nevertheless, the company's quarterly earnings trumped Wall Street 
estimates as did revenues, reflecting strong performance of its cloud business. Armonk, New York-based IBM's 
third-quarter profit dropped to USD2.85 billion or USD2.98 per share from USD2.95 billion or USD3.03 per share 
last year.
----------
A final decision is expected Tuesday on a proposed settlement in Volkswagen's emissions test scandal affecting 
millions of its diesel cars sold in the US. A decision on the settlement, negotiated by Volkswagen and numerous 
civil claimants, will be issued at 8 am by Judge Charles Breyer of US District Court for the Northern District of 
California in San Francisco. Breyer gave preliminary approval to the USD14.7 billion settlement in July, saying the 
deal is fair and reasonable after hearing US authorities, plaintiffs and Volkswagen make their cases.
----------
Visa announced that Charlie Scharf is resigning as chief executive officer and board member because he could no 
longer spend the time in San Francisco necessary to do the job effectively. The board has unanimously voted to 
appoint Alfred Kelly, Jr. as CEO. Kelly, a current Visa board member, is the president and chief executive officer of 
Intersection Co. and the former president of American Express Co.
----------
Walt Disney decided not to pursue a bid for Twitter partly out of concern that bullying and other uncivil forms of 
communication on the social media site might soil the company's wholesome family image, Bloomberg reported 
citing people familiar with matter. The company had gone so far as to hire two investment banks, JPMorgan Chase 
and Guggenheim Partners, to help evaluate a bid for Twitter. Disney management also listened to a presentation 
about the business from Twitter executives, the report said.
----------
Shares of Netflix surged a near 20% in the extended trading session in New York on Monday after the online-video 
streaming service reported a third-quarter profit that trumped analysts estimates, driven largely by higher-than-
expected revenue growth and subscriber additions. Netflix added 3.57 million subscribers globally in the quarter, 
easily beating its forecast of 2.30 million, to end the quarter with 86.74 million subscribers. The company added 
370,000 customers in the US during the quarter, well below its estimates. International subscriber additions were 
3.20 million, far above its expectation of 2.00 million.
----------
Retail giant Target has reportedly stopped selling clown masks because of several incidents of clown attacks being 
reported all over the US recently. "Given the current environment, we have made the decision to remove a variety 
of clown masks from our assortment, both in stores and online," Target spokesperson Joshua Thomas told WCCO 
Minneapolis. The retailer, which has 1,799 stores in the US, did not indicate whether the decision would affect all of 
its stores. However, it seems that Target has taken down clown masks from its website entirely.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - European stocks are rallying on Tuesday, as a weaker dollar supported commodity 
prices and soft US data dented hopes of a Fed rate hike in November.
Well-received earnings updates from the likes of Hays PLC, Bellway and Rémy Cointreau also buoyed investor 
sentiment ahead of Chinese GDP data due on Wednesday and the ECB meeting on Thursday.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index is currently up 1.20% at 341.46 in midday trading after closing 0.7% 
lower in the previous session. The German DAX is rallying 1.3%, France's CAC 40 index is moving up 1.2% and 
the UK's FTSE 100 is adding 0.9%.
Rémy Cointreau shares are up more than three percent in Paris. The wine & spirits company reported a 2.5% rise 
in first-half sales on the back of improved cognac sales in China and robust demand for its premium cognac in the 
US.
Mining stocks such as Anglo American, BHP Billiton, Glencore and Rio Tinto are up 2-3%, while energy majors 
Tullow Oil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP PLC are climbing 1-3%.
Shares of Hays PLC are moving up 2%. The recruitment company reported growth in net fee income for the first 
quarter of fiscal 2017, led by strong performance in its international businesses.
Bookmaker William Hill is adding 1.5% after it ended talks of a possible merger with Canadian online poker giant 
Amaya.
Homebuilder Bellway is up over 1% on reporting a jump in full-year profit and raising its dividend.
Continental shares are tumbling 2% after the German tire maker cut its earnings outlook for fiscal 2016, citing 
antitrust and warranty provisions.
European Shares Rally As Weak Dollar Lifts Commodity Prices
Swiss logistics firm Kuehne + Nagel Group is losing 3% after its earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 
missed estimates.
Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings is rallying 2.5% in London despite lowering its profit outlook.
On a relatively light day on the economic front, a government report showed that UK consumer inflation hit a two-
year high in September on higher clothing and transport costs, as a result of the weakening pound since the EU 
referendum vote.
Inflation rose to 1% from 0.6% in August versus expectations for a 0.9% increase. Factory gate prices also rose at a 
faster pace of 1.2% annually in September, following a rise of 0.9% in August.
Globally, most Asian shares rose today and US stock futures indicate a positive open, as the dollar weakened 
against rivals on uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - After moving modestly lower earlier in the session, stocks have seen some further 
downside in recent trading on Friday. The major averages have slid firmly into negative territory, hitting new lows for 
the session.
In recent trading, the major averages have climbed off their worst levels of the day. The Dow is down 89.40 points 
or 0.5% at 18,179.10, the Nasdaq is down 33.58 points or 0.6% at 5,273.27 and the S&P 500 is down 13.51 points 
or 0.6% at 2,147.26.
The weakness on Wall Street comes following the release of a report from the Labor Department showing that US 
employment increased by less than expected in the month of September.
The report said non-farm payroll employment climbed by 156,000 jobs in September compared to economist 
estimates for an increase of about 176,000 jobs.
While the job gains in August were upwardly revised to 167,000 from 151,000, the job growth in July was 
downwardly revised to 252,000 from 275,000.
The Labor Department also said the unemployment rate edged up to 5.0% in September from 4.9% in August. 
Economists had expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged.
Meanwhile, the report said average hourly employee earnings rose by 6 cents to USD25.79. Compared to the same 
month a year ago, average hourly earnings were up by 2.6%.
Speaking at the Institute of International Finance's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Federal Reserve Vice 
Chair Stanley Fischer said the jobs data was "pretty close" to an ideal "Goldilocks" reading.
Fischer said the rate of job growth is "fully consistent" with a continued decline in unemployment and suggested the 
US is close to full employment.
Stocks See Further Downside Following Early Pullback - US Commentary
Analysts said the weaker than expected job growth should quell any speculation of an interest rate hike at Fed's 
next meeting in November, although a rate hike at the December meeting remains on the table.
Sector News
Chemical stocks have shown a substantial move to the downside on the day, dragging the Dow Jones Chemicals 
Index down by 1.9%. The pullback by the index comes after it ended the previous session at its best closing level in 
a month.
PPG Industries (PPG) is leading the chemical sector lower after warning of much weaker than expected third 
quarter earnings.
Significant weakness has also emerged among airline stocks, as reflected by the 1.4% drop by the NYSE Arca 
Airline Index. Ryanair (RYAAY) is posting a particularly steep loss.
Tobacco, natural gas, housing, and electronic storage stocks have also come under pressure, moving lower along 
with most of the other major sectors.
Other Markets
In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved to the downside during trading on Friday. 
Japan's Nikkei 225 Index dipped by 0.2%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell by 0.4%.
Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the UK's FTSE 100 
Index advanced by 0.6%, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index both dropped by 0.7%.
In the bond market, treasuries are seeing modest weakness, extending a recent downward trend. As a result, the 
yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 1.7 basis points at 1.759%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - easyJet PLC on Thursday said it achieved record passenger numbers, a higher load 
factor and a strong profit in the summer months, despite "major external shock events and disruption".
The low-cost airline said it carried a record 22.0 million passengers in the three months ended September 30, 
easyJet's financial fourth quarter, while its load factor was 93.9%. It said passengers benefited from low fares 
across its network, with revenue per seat at constant currency decreasing by 8.7% year-on-year.
easyJet said it faced a difficult operating environment hit by "major disruption", exchange rate fluctuation, and lower 
leisure travel demand after multiple terrorist attacks across Europe and North Africa.
In the full financial year to September 30, easyJet expects cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency to have 
decreased by 1.1% year-on-year, slightly better than its previous guidance, while cost per seat including fuel is 
expected to have decreased by 4.6%.
easyJet did say, however, that the weakening of sterling since the UK's vote to leave the EU has hurt the company, 
and will reduce full-year results by GBP90 million, which is a GBP35 million increase on the hit it had predicted 
when the referendum was held on June 23.
easyJet added that pretax profit will be between GBP490 million and GBP495 million in the full year.
"The current environment is tough for all airlines, but history shows that at times like this the strongest airlines 
become stronger. That is why we will continue to invest for the long-term success of the business, establishing even 
stronger market positions, delivering excellent customer service and establishing new revenue opportunities for the 
future," Chief Executive Carolyn McCall said in a statement.
For the month of September, easyJet reported 5.2% growth in the number of passengers carried to 7.0 million from 
6.6 million in September 2015, although load factor declined by 2.0 percentage points to 91.1% from 93.1%.
TOP NEWS: easyJet Flys Record Summer Passengers But Takes Pound Hit
On a rolling annual basis, passenger numbers rose by 6.6% to 73.1 million from 68.6 million, as load factor 
increased by 0.1 percentage point to 91.6% from 91.5%.
On Tuesday, fellow budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air PLC also reported their traffic figures for 
September.
Irish airline Ryanair said the number of customers rose by 13% in September to 10.8 million from 9.5 million the 
year before, as load factor increased by one percentage point to 95% from 94%.
Meanwhile, Eastern and Central European-focused Wizz Air said the number of passengers grew by 18% in 
September to 2.1 million from 1.8 million, while load factor increased by 0.7 percentage point to 91.6% from 90.9%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Shares in low-cost airline easyJet PLC plummeted on Thursday after it warned on full-
year profit as it now expects a bigger hit from post-Brexit sterling weakness than previously anticipated.
Shares in easyJet were trading down 5.6% at 946.67 pence on Thursday afternoon, the worst performer in the 
FTSE 100. The losses in the low-cost airline dragged peers such as International Consolidated Airlines Group, 
down 2.9%, FTSE 250-listed Wizz Air Holdings, down 0.8%, and Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings, down 2.6%.
Pound weakness is an issue for UK airlines as it reduces the fares in euro terms on routes to and from the UK. 
Since the UK's vote to leave the EU, airlines have warned on the effects weak sterling will have on their 
businesses, leading to profit warnings and plans to scale back growth in the UK.
In May, as sterling began to weaken in the run-up to the EU referendum, easyJet said it expected a GBP55 million 
hit to full-year earnings. But after the result of the vote was announced in late June, the carrier attempted to soothe 
investor concerns by releasing a statement saying Brexit would not have a "material impact" on its ability to deliver 
long-term sustainable earnings growth.
Shortly after in July, easyJet increased its forecast to an expected GBP80 million hit on full-year earnings. At that 
time, the airline's Chief Executive Carolyn McCall also revealed that the company had been forced to promote seats 
for June and July, having never had to promote flights over the summer before. McCall blamed this on softening 
consumer confidence.
On Thursday, easyJet as it upped its estimate again to a GBP90 million hit on full-year earnings, and warned that 
pretax profit for the financial year ended September 30 will drop to between GBP490 million and GBP495 million, 
down from GBP686 million the year before.
Analysts were not impressed with easyJet's update. Liberum said the guidance was "disappointing" given its own 
forecast for full-year profit was GBP523 million, while Head of Research at Accendo Markets Mike van Dulken 
described it as "another blow to shareholders".

easyJet is not the only airline facing down foreign exchange issues and Brexit-related concerns, however.
Back in July, Eastern and Central European-focused budget airline Wizz Air announced plans to readjust its 
network by halving its growth plans for the UK and redeploying capacity to non-UK routes, as a result of sterling 
weakness. Wizz Air did, however, maintain its full-year profit guidance.
Similarly, Irish budget airline Ryanair, an active campaigner in favour of the UK staying in the EU ahead of the 
referendum, also in July revealed that it would pivot growth away from UK airports towards its other airport bases in 
the EU. Ryanair warned that sterling weakness would put downward pressure on fares until at least the end of 
2017. Like Wizz Air, though, Ryanair maintained its full-year profit guidance.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, was last week reported to have told reporters the Brexit vote will weigh 
on profits for the carrier for the next four years.
Meanwhile, International Consolidated Airlines Group lowered its forecast for full-year operating profit in July after 
profit in its fiscal second quarter was hit by the depreciation of sterling. IAG - which owns British Airways, Spanish 
carriers Iberia and Vueling, and Irish airline Aer Lingus - also decided to cut capacity growth plans.
In contrast to IAG, Ryanair and Wizz Air, however, easyJet said in July that rather than reduce capacity in the UK, it 
would "take advantage" of weakness amongst other airlines by growing in the country.
easyJet's weaker profit forecast comes despite it saying it achieved strong profit growth in the fourth quarter, and 
despite it predicting a 1.1% decrease in cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency in the full year, slightly 
better than its previous guidance of a 1.0% fall. Including fuel, cost per seat is expected to decrease by 4.6% at 
constant currency.
Revenue per seat, meanwhile, is predicted to decline by 8.7% in the full year at constant currency, although lower 
fares meant easyJet carried a record 22.0 million passengers in the fourth quarter. Load factor in the quarter was 
93.9%.
easyJet said it faced a difficult operating environment in the summer months, hit by "major disruption" - relating to 
air traffic control strikes and resultant flight cancellations across Europe - exchange rate fluctuation, and lower 
leisure travel demand after multiple terrorist attacks across Europe and North Africa. 
Terrorist attacks include those in Brussels in March - when suicide bombers detonated explosives at one of the 
city's airports and at a metro station - the crash of an Egyptair flight en route to Cairo from Paris in May, and an 
attack in Nice when a lorry driver deliberately drove into a crowd of people celebrating France's Bastille Day in July.
Those events followed on from attacks by gunmen and suicide bombers in Paris last November, a mass shooting at 
a Tunisian beach resort in June 2015, and the downing of a Russian passenger jet shortly after it took off from the 
popular Egyptian holiday resort of Sharm el Sheikh last October.
This all comes amid a massive reduction in demand for flights to Turkey, which has been plagued by a series of 
other terror attacks and ongoing political turmoil, including an unsuccessful coup attempt earlier this year.
Despite this, easyJet reported 5.2% growth in the number of passengers it carried in September to 7.0 million from 
6.6 million in September 2015, although load factor declined by 2.0 percentage points to 91.1% from 93.1%.
On a rolling annual basis, passenger numbers rose by 6.6% to 73.1 million from 68.6 million, as load factor 
increased by 0.1 percentage point to 91.6% from 91.5%.
Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said easyJet's passenger numbers were "smashing" 
while load factor was "much improved", but noted that "Brexit has taken much shine out".
Cantor Fitzgerald also said that despite the headwinds, "the fundamentals of easyJet remain sound".
IN DEPTH: easyJet Shares Nose Dive As Weak Pound Weighs On Profit
Accendo Markets' van Dulken was less enthusiastic, however.
"Management's message of record passenger numbers, higher load factors, strong profit growth and lower costs 
per seat just isn't cutting it, even within a difficult operating environment," van Dulken said.
easyJet added that 45% of seats are now sold for the first quarter of its new financial year, which is in line with last 
year. Revenue per seat continues to be down year-on-year and is currently expected to be broadly in line with the 
reduction seen in the fourth quarter of the last year.
"The current environment is tough for all airlines, but history shows that at times like this the strongest airlines 
become stronger. That is why we will continue to invest for the long-term success of the business, establishing even 
stronger market positions, delivering excellent customer service and establishing new revenue opportunities for the 
future," CEO McCall said in a statement.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Brokers reduced their financial year 2017 pretax profit estimates on easyJet, after the 
budget airline cut its guidance for financial 2016, due to weakness in the pound since the UK's vote to leave the 
European Union.
easyJet shares were down 5.8% at 944.68 pence on Thursday, the worst performing stock in the FTSE 100. The 
losses in the low-cost airline were dragging peers such as International Consolidated Airlines Group, down 1.8%, 
FTSE 250-listed Wizz Air Holdings, down 0.3%, and Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings, down 0.4%.
Sterling's current weakness is representing an issue for UK airlines as it reduces the fares in euro terms on routes 
to and from the UK. In May, the pound began to weaken in the run-up to the EU referendum and touched its lowest 
level in 31 years on Wednesday. 
The pound was standing at USD1.2729 on Thursday morning, having touched a low of USD1.2684 on Wednesday. 
In May, easyJet said it expected a GBP55 million hit to full-year earnings, before increasing this to an expected 
GBP80 million hit in July after the vote result was revealed. On Thursday, the low-cost airline upped this estimate 
once again to GBP90 million.
As a result, pretax profit for the financial year ended September 30 will be between GBP490 million and GBP495 
million, down from GBP686 million the year before.
Liberum said easyJet's updated guidance was "disappointing". The broker said its own forecast for financial 2016 is 
GBP523 million, while it said the Bloomberg-compiled market consensus is GBP516 million. 
"We expect financial 2016 consensus to fall to match guidance, and see downside risk to financial 2017 consensus. 
Our recommendation remains Sell with a 930.00p price target," said Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo.
IN THE KNOW: Brokers Cut 2017 Estimates After easyJet Profit Warning
Numis said its financial 2016 pretax profit forecast is GBP495 million. "However, we are downgrading financial 2017 
forecasts (cautiously at this stage,) to reflect continuing yield pressure and further FX headwinds," noted Numis 
analyst Wyn Ellis.
The broker cut its financial 2017 pretax profit estimate to GBP495 million to GBP400 million. Numis retained a Hold 
recommendation and a price target of 1,200.00p. 
Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde expects consensus forecasts for financial 2017 to be cut by 5% to 10%. 
Nevertheless, the analyst said that, despite the headwinds, "the fundamentals of easyJet remain sound".
The broker kept a Buy recommendation and a price target of 1,300.00p. "easyJet remains good value," noted Byde. 
The weaker profit forecast comes despite easyJet's cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency decreasing by 
1.1% year-on-year, slightly better than its previous guidance, and cost per seat including fuel decreasing by 4.6%.
The lower guidance also was despite easyJet carrying a record 22.0 million passengers in its financial fourth 
quarter, with passengers benefiting from low fares across the airline's network. Load factor in the quarter was 
93.9% and revenue per seat at constant currency decreased by 8.7% year-on-year.
easyJet said it faced a difficult operating environment in the summer months hit by "major disruption" - relating to air 
traffic control strikes - exchange rate fluctuation, and lower leisure travel demand after multiple terrorist attacks 
across Europe and North Africa.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London were lower on Thursday morning, with focus on the European Central 
Bank meeting minutes in the afternoon.
In the meantime, with easyJet was dragging its down its airline peers after issuing a profit warning, despite 
achieving record passenger numbers over the summer.
The FTSE 100 index was down 0.1%, or 6.80 points, at 7,026.45. The FTSE 250 was 0.1% lower at 18,187.72 
points and the AIM All-Share was flat at 826.89.
The BATS UK 100 index also started lower, down 0.1% at 11,897.08, the BATS 250 was down 0.1% at 16,609.83, 
and the BATS Small Companies was flat at 11,329.72. 
easyJet said it carried a record 22.0 million passengers in the three months ended September 30, the airline's 
financial fourth quarter, while its load factor was 93.9%. It said passengers benefited from low fares across its 
network, with revenue per seat at constant currency decreasing by 8.7% year-on-year.
The low-cost air carrier said it faced a difficult operating environment hit by "major disruption", exchange rate 
fluctuation, and lower leisure travel demand after multiple terrorist attacks across Europe and North Africa.
In the full financial year to September 30, easyJet expects cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency to have 
decreased by 1.1% year-on-year, slightly better than its previous guidance, while cost per seat including fuel is 
expected to have decreased by 4.6%.
However, easyJet said the weakening of the pound since the UK's vote to leave the European Union will reduce 
full-year results by GBP90 million, which is a GBP35 million increase on the hit it had predicted when the 
referendum was held on June 23. 
easyJet said pretax profit will be between GBP490 million and GBP495 million in the full year. This is below Davy 
Research expectation of GBP509 million and the previous year's figure of GBP686 million. 
LONDON MARKET OPEN: easyJet Drags Airlines Down After Profit Warning
Peer International Consolidated Airlines Group was down 1.1%. Late Wednesday, IAG reported growth in group 
traffic and capacity in September but a dip in load factor year-on-year. 
FTSE 250-listed Wizz Air Holdings was down 3.10%, while Irish Ryanair Holdings was down 1.6%. On Tuesday, 
both airlines reported traffic figures for September, both reporting increased load factor and customer volume.
The ECB releases the accounts of its September 8 monetary policy meeting at 1230 BST, with analysts at French 
bank Societe Generale looking for "informative minutes".
"In particular, we look for hints as to why the council remained silent about its Quantitative Easing program end date 
and design. Any additional flavour from the minutes will be helpful in forming market expectations for the 
forthcoming meetings," said SocGen.
The minutes come after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the ECB is reaching a consensus to start gradually 
winding down bond purchases before the conclusion of quantitative easing. The report said an informal consensus 
has built among policy makers in the past month that asset buying will have to be tapered, citing unnamed euro-
zone central bank officials.
The current quantitative easing programme started less than six months ago and the earliest end-date is in March 
2017. The central bank said later Tuesday the report was erroneous.
The CAC 40 index in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt both opened up 0.4%. 
German factory orders climbed 1.0% in August from July, when they grew by 0.3%. This was the second 
consecutive rise in orders. Economists had expected orders to grow 0.3% in August.
In Asia on Thursday, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo ended up 0.5%. In China, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong 
continues 0.7% higher. The Shanghai market remains closed for a week-long national holiday.
Wall Street ended higher on Wednesday, with the Dow Industrials up 0.6%, the S&P 500 0.4% higher and the 
Nasdaq Composite up 0.5%. In the US economic calendar, there are US challenger job cuts data at 1230 BST, 
while US initial and continuing jobless claims are at 1330 BST. 
Elsewhere among London-listed stocks, Smith & Nephew was down 1.3%, after Berenberg cut its recommendation 
on the medical devices maker to Hold from Buy. 
Croda International was up 1.7%. The specialty chemicals firm was the best blue-chip performer, after UBS raised 
its stance to Buy from Sell. Croda was added to the FTSE 100 Thursday, replacing SAB Miller, after the acquisition 
by AB Inbev of the drinks giant was completed.
In the FTSE 250, BTG was up 2.6%, the best mid-cap performer, after saying revenue in its current financial year is 
set to outpace its expectations thanks to a translation boost from sterling weakness.
Given the fall in the value of sterling against the dollar following the UK's vote to leave the European Union, BTG 
said it expects revenue for the year to the end of March to be ahead of its previously-guided range of GBP510 
million to GBP540 million.
DFS Furniture was up 2.3% after the retailer reported a big jump in profit in its recently-ended financial year thanks 
to good growth in revenue, and it said it is well-positioned despite uncertainties caused by the UK's vote to leave 
the European Union.
SVG Capital agreed in principle the terms of a sale of 100% of its investment portfolio to a joint partnership of US 
investment bank Goldman Sachs and the Canada Pension Plan Investment board. 
LONDON MARKET OPEN: easyJet Drags Airlines Down After Profit Warning
SVG said the offer values its assets at approximately GBP748.0 million, a 6.8% discount to the GBP802.0 million 
value of the portfolio at July 31. SVG said that when factoring in its own net cash resources and estimated costs, 
the deal values SVG at approximately 680 pence a share.
SVG proposes a GBP1.06 billion return to shareholders after the sale, via a series of tender offers, each priced at 
680p a share, above the 650p offered by bid rival HarbourVest. The stock was down 0.8% at 665.00 pence. 
Dunelm Group was the biggest FTSE 250 decliner, down 4.9%, after the homeware retailer reported a fall in sales 
in the first quarter of its financial year, hit by warm summer weather, but said it looks forward to a stronger second 
quarter.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it has launched a major recruitment drive that 
will lead to the creation of 3,500 new jobs in 2017 as it prepares to take delivery of 50 new aircraft over the next 
months. 
Ryanair plans to recruit 2,000 new cabin crew, 1,000 new pilots, and 250 aircraft engineers, in addition to promoting 
300 first officers, meaning those who are second in command of an aircraft, across its 84-base network in Europe. 
"2017 is set to be our busiest recruitment year to date, and we are continuing to invest heavily in talent for the 
future. Ryanair is now considered to be the 'go-to' airline for both cadet and direct entry hires, with our industry 
leading 5/4 roster for pilots, and both pilots and cabin crew have the opportunity to work on the youngest fleet in 
Europe as we take delivery of our new Boeing aircraft," said Eddie Wilson, chief people officer at Ryanair. 
"As our aircraft numbers grow from 355 to over 500 in the next five years, Ryanair will hire over 5,000 new people," 
he added. 
A range of new positions will also be created in the IT, Sales & Marketing, Digital Experience, Finance and 
Commercial divisions at Ryanair's Dublin office, and also at the Travel Labs Poland subsidiary in Wroclaw.
The Irish airline, in a separate statement, also reported significant year-on-year growth in customer numbers during 
September, rising 13%, alongside a small lift to its load factor and a 16% lift in rolling annual traffic. 
Ryanair shares were trading down 0.5% to EUR12.13 per share on Tuesday afternoon.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are called for a negative open on Tuesday, with analysts 
differing on the direction the UK construction Purchasing Managers' Index reading will show at 0930 BST. 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index to open 6.52 points down at 6,977.00. The blue-chip index closed up 
1.2%, or 84.14 points, at 6,983.52 on Monday. 
In early UK company news, low-cost airlines Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air Holdings reported growth in the number 
of passengers carried and load factor year-on-year in September, while bakery and food-to-go retailer Greggs said 
its expectations for the full year remain unchanged following third quarter sales grow. 
Construction company Carillion was selected by lender Nationwide Building Society to provide facilities 
management services, in a deal expected to be worth around GBP350.0 million over its term. 
According to FXStreet.com, consensus expects a score of 49.0 in the UK construction PMI for September, slightly 
lower than the 49.2 reading seen in August. Any reading below 50 suggests contraction in the industry. 
CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson comments: "The construction sector has been a significant 
underperformer in the last three to four months, posting sub 50 readings every month since June. [CMC Markets'] 
expectations are for a reading of 49.1." 
Contrary to what Hewson envisages, analysts at French bank Societe Generale expect the construction PMI to 
reach expansion territory, looking for a score of 50.2.
"Judging by the improving sentiment in the housing market, we expect further recovery in that area of construction 
and the surprising resilience of general activity bodes well for commercial construction as well," says the bank. 
In Asia on Tuesday, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.2%. The Shanghai market is closed all week for 
National Day celebrations.

The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo ended 0.8% higher. Japan's confidence improved for the second straight month in 
September to the highest level in three years, defying economists' expectations for a decrease, survey figures from 
Cabinet Office showed.
The consumer confidence index rose to 43.0 in September from 42.0 in August. It was the highest since September 
2013, when it marked 45.4. Economists had expected the index to fall to 41.5.
Also overnight, the Reserve Bank of Australia maintained interest rates unchanged at 1.50%.
Wall Street ended lower on Monday, with the Dow Industrial and the S&P 500 down 0.3% and the Nasdaq 
Composite 0.2% lower.
Elsewhere in the economic calendar, the eurozone producer price index is at 1000 BST. In the afternoon, the US 
Redbook index is at 1355 BST, while the ISM New York index is at 1445 BST. The API weekly crude oil stocks data 
are at 2130 BST. 
James Bardrick, the head of US bank Citigroup's UK arm, said financial jobs in London could be lost to the 
continent unless the financial sector can be assured of continued access to vital European Union markets.
Speaking at a Conservative Party conference fringe event in Birmingham on Monday, Bardrick warned some banks 
would have to reduce their size in Britain and move staff and activities across the Channel without guarantees 
about their ability to operate in the remaining 27 EU nations after Brexit.
Under passporting rules, financial institutions set up in the UK are able to operate in other EU states. Unless those 
rules are allowed to continue, or an equivalence regime is established, City institutions face the prospect of losing 
their ability to operate fully in the remaining EU states. Bardrick said banks would be reluctant to move from London 
because of the efficient operations and talented staff they have in the capital - but it would depend on the ability to 
operate.
Greggs said total sales in the 13 weeks to October 1 grew by 5.6% year-on-year, as company-managed shop like-
for-like sales rose by 2.8%. Total sales benefited from the 103 new shops opened in the year so far, as 58 stores 
were closed, while 145 store refits also have been completed so far this year. Greggs aims to refurbish around 200 
shops this year. It now trades from 1,743 shops, all in the UK.
Carillion said that, under the new seven-year contract, it will provide a wide range of hard and soft facilities 
management along with workplace services for Nationwide's headquarters in Swindon, its 15 corporate offices, 
critical data centres and 700 retail branches. 
The contract commenced on Saturday and has the potential to be extended for a further three years. The services 
will include energy management, asset maintenance, security, ground maintenance, mailroom management and 
cleaning.
Ryanair said its number of customers rose by 13% in September to 10.8 million from 9.5 million the year before, as 
load factor increased by one percentage point to 95% from 94%. 
Meanwhile, Eastern and Central European-focused budget airline Wizz Air said its number of passengers grew by 
18% in September to 2.1 million from 1.8 million, while load factor increased by 0.7 percentage point to 91.6% from 
90.9%.

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, has 
said Britain's decision to quit the EU will weigh on the carrier's profit for as long as four years, Bloomberg reported 
Tuesday.
The process of the UK withdrawing from the union could take two to four years, and would depress yields, a 
measure of ticket prices and profitability in the airline industry, the CEO reportedly said.
O'Leary said in a briefing with reporters in Brussels on Tuesday, "The outlook for the UK economy is poor. This will 
mean slower GDP growth in the UK and European economies."
The company has already taken contingency plans including shifting growth away from the UK for the next two 
years. The carrier is planning to send about 50 new aircraft due for delivery this year to outside UK routes.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC confirmed plans to move business away from 
the UK following its vote to leave the European Union, adding that the country will be "screwed" in Brexit 
negotiations, according to the Times.
Back in July, Ryanair announced plans to pivot growth away from UK airports towards other airport bases in the EU 
over the next two years, beginning with a reduction in capacity and frequency on many London Stansted routes this 
winter.
Later in the month, Ryanair announced the launch of new routes and flights to its London summer 2017 schedule 
from both London Stansted and London Luton, but the Guardian reported that 5.5 million fewer passengers would 
be carried to and from the UK overall in 2017 as Ryanair bases new planes in other European countries instead.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, who was an active campaigner to remain in the EU, said the airline will now move 
business away from the UK in the next 18 months, according to the Times report.
"I have no faith in the politicians in London going on about how 'the world will want to trade with us'. The world will 
want to screw you — that's what happens in trade talks," O'Leary said, according to the newspaper.
"Nobody in the airline industry knows what the outcome of Brexit is, which puts us in exactly the same situation as 
most of the cabinet of the government of the UK," he added.
According to the Times, O'Leary also reiterated his call for air passenger duty to be scrapped in Britain, after 
dropping two of its four routes from City of Derry airport in Northern Ireland, one of which was to London Stansted 
and the other to Faro in Portugal.
The CEO said the average fare paid by customers through most of January on the Stansted route was less than the 
duty of GBP13, warning that the two remaining services from Derry, which are to Liverpool and Glasgow, may be 
moved to Ryanair's main base in the north at Belfast International, according to the Times.

Two million Northern Irish travellers choose to fly out of Dublin airport, where there is no similar passenger duty, 
rather than fly from Belfast or Derry, according to O'Leary, who reportedly added that he would have based another

PARIS (Alliance News) - European airlines say hundreds of flights were delayed or cancelled on Thursday due to a 
strike by air traffic controllers in France.
Airlines Easyjet, Ryanair, British Airways and Aer Lingus each reported numerous flights cancelled due to the strike, 
which was set to impact thousands of passengers.
More than 300 flights were estimated to be cancelled, as airlines in Europe reduced their offering by 15%, 
according to lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E).
The strike, which is expected to last for 35 hours, is the latest of several walk-outs this year by French air traffic 
controllers in protest at France's controversial labour reforms passed in July in an effort to jumpstart the country's 
flagging economy.
The labour action drew criticism from A4E lobbyists representing several airlines affected by the strike.
"The demands of increasingly mobile European citizens and businesses cannot be taken hostage by localized 
industrial action. It is about time to minimize the impact of these strike actions," A4E chief Thomas Reynaert said, 
also criticizing a lack in measures from European authorities to prevent such strikes.
Europe has already seen several strikes this year by air traffic controllers in Italy, Belgium, Greece and France, 
leading to thousands of cancelled and delayed flights.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday its 2017 summer flight schedule from Madrid 
would be its busiest to date, increasing traffic by 6%. 
The schedule will include three new routes to Luxembourg, Newcastle and Verona and four new summer services 
to Brussels, Sofia, Toulouse and Wroclaw. Flights to Milan, Eindhoven and Rabat will become more frequent.
Ryanair said it expects its Madrid services to carry around 6.5 million customers per year, adding 350,000 to its 
previous numbers. 
"We are pleased to launch our biggest ever Madrid summer schedule," said Chief Executive Michael O'Leary. 
"Customers can look forward to even lower fares when they make advance bookings for summer 2017. As our 
recent guidance confirmed, Ryanair expects average fares to fall by between 10% to 12% in the 6 months to March 
2017," added the chief executive. 
Shares in Ryanair were up 0.9% at 13.11 Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UK equity indices made a mixed start to trade on Friday, while McCarthy & Stone 
shares were sold off after the retirement housebuilder said that weakness in the secondary housing market since its 
June trading update could mean it misses its growth target for the year.
The FTSE-250 listed company said new reservations have been made at a lower level since June and it has had 
more cancellations. McCarthy & Stone said if there is a prolonged housing market weakness due to Brexit and the 
Bank of England's changes to monetary policy, it "could affect our ability to deliver our targeted 15% volume 
growth" for the financial year ended August 31.
McCarthy & Stone's trading update said revenue increased by 31% to GBP635.0 million for the year from 
GBP486.0 million year on year. Legal completions were up 20% to 2,299 units from 1,923 units and the net average 
selling price climbed by 8% to GBP259,000 from GBP239,000.
McCarthy and Stone also said it had around GBP52.0 million net cash at the end of the year. The stock was the 
worst performer in the FTSE 250, down 12%. 
The FTSE 100 was up 0.2%, or 14.63 points, at 6,760.60. The FTSE 250 was down 0.4% at 17,781.19 and the AIM 
All-Share was flat at 791.35. 
In Europe, the CAC 40 index was up 0.4% and the DAX 30 was up 0.1%.
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo ended flat and the Shanghai Composite finished up 0.1%. The Hang Seng 
index in Hong Kong is up 0.4%.
Go-Ahead Group was the best mid-cap performer in London, up 5.9%, after the public transport operator said its 
overall results in the past financial year were "slightly ahead of expectations".
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Housing Market Weakness Hits McCarthy & Stone
The company said pretax profit in its financial year to July 2 rose 27% to GBP99.8 million from GBP78.7 million as 
revenue climbed to GBP3.36 billion from GBP3.21 billion a year ago. Adjusted profit, which excludes certain items, 
rose to GBP138.5 million from GBP99.1 million.
Ibstock traded down 7.6% at 172.00 pence. UBS on Thursday after the market close said it and JP Morgan 
Securities have been retained by Diamond (BC) to explore the opportunity to sell 40.5 million shares in London-
listed brick maker.
On Friday, UBS confirmed Diamond sold 40.5 million shares at 175p per share, raising GBP70.9 million. 
Ryanair Holdings was down 0.2% after it reported growth in customers carried and in load factor year-on-year in 
August. The company added that it expects average fares to fall by between 10% and 12% in the six months to 
March 2017 following the UK's vote to leave the European Union.

Ryanair Shifts Capacity From Dublin And UK To Other European Countries
Ryanair Shifts Capacity From Dublin And UK To Other European Countries

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday said it will switch 3% of its passenger seats away 
from Dublin to lower cost airports elsewhere in Europe in summer 2017 after the Dublin Airport Authority 
withdrawing its growth initiatives.
The move followed the airline's decision to scale back growth in the UK following the referendum vote to leave the 
European Union.
The Irish budget carrier said it will carry over 14 million customers to and from Ireland in 2017, with increased flights 
and frequencies at Shannon and Cork, but will cut capacity at Dublin.
Ryanair will add more frequencies from Dublin to 'sun' destinations Palma in Majorca, Reus in Spain and Spanish 
island Tenerife, with 85 routes from the Irish capital in total, but the number of customers will be reduced to 12 
million a year overall.
In Shannon, Ryanair will introduce more flights to Lanzarote, operating 14 routes in total and carrying over 700,000 
customers a year.
Cork will see more flights to Lanzarote and Malaga, with 17 routes in total and carrying 860,000 customers a year.
Meanwhile, Knock and Kerry will continue operating 12 routes and 5 routes, respectively.
"We are pleased with this early launch date of our Irish summer 2017 schedule with more frequency to sun 
destinations at lower fares, making family holidays even more affordable. It's a pity the DAA chose to discontinue its 
growth incentive into 2017, which means that Dublin Airport is becoming uncompetitive, and which incentivizes 
Ryanair to switch growth to other lower cost airports in Europe," Chief Operating Officer Kenny Jacobs said in a 
statement.
On Wednesday, Ryanair had announced the launch of new routes and flights to its London summer 2017 schedule 
from both London Stansted and London Luton. 
Ryanair Shifts Capacity From Dublin And UK To Other European Countries
But according to the Guardian, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the airline would carry 5.5 million 
fewer passengers to and from the UK overall in 2017 due to the Brexit vote. O'Leary reportedly said UK traffic 
growth would slow to 6% next year from 15% in 2016, but would have grown by double digits had the country voted 
to remain in the EU.
This means UK passenger numbers would fall to 44.5 million from an expected 50.0 million, as Ryanair bases new 
planes in other European countries instead.
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 1.8% at EUR12.21 on Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it will add new routes and flights to its 
London summer 2017 schedule, as it called on the UK government to approve three new runways for the capital.
The Irish budget carrier said it will launch a new route to Strasbourg in France from London Stansted, while 
increasing the number of flights from the airport northeast of London to Sofia in Bulgaria and Nuremberg in 
Germany. In total, London Stansted will operate 132 routes, catering for 19.9 million customers per year and 
supporting 15,000 jobs, Ryanair said.
From London Luton, Ryanair will launch a new route to Faro in Portugal. In total, London Luton, north of London, 
will operate 18 routes, catering for 2 million customers per year and supporting 1,500 jobs.
Ryanair will also continue to operate its five routes from London Gatwick, south of the capital.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair "calls on Prime Minister Theresa May to approve three new runways 
- one each at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, which will finally resolve the runway capacity issue for the next 50 
years, while ensuring competition between airports delivers efficient facilities and prevents airlines and passengers 
being ripped off by gold-plated monopoly runways".
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 1.3% at EUR11.99 on Wednesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair's "industry-leading" cash generation should shore up its shares compared to its 
rivals in the European airline sector, said Barclays analysts after a visit to the budget airline in Dublin. 
The analysts said Ryanair management continues to forecast EUR1.4 billion net profit for the 2017 full year, despite 
a possible 9% drop on average airfares in the first half of the financial year compared to the previous year, and the 
"realistic prospect" of a 10-12% comparable drop for winter price. 
The analysts said Ryanair expects the price gap to be made up by high booking volumes as well as ancillaries and 
lower ex-fuel unit costs. They added that Ryanair Labs gave updates on the company's digital progress with 
opportunities to upsell through its MyRyanair platform and mobile app, and there could be updated financial targets 
around such ancillaries in the first half results. 
The Barclays analysts highlighted Ryanair's cash strength, noting the airline could achieve a 10% compound 
annual growth rate entirely out of operating cashflow with room for shareholder returns. They noted while 
management refused to commit to a multi-year dividend or buyback scheme, there appeared to be an ambition of 
returning approximately EUR1.0 billion to shareholders annually.
"With a (hopefully) conservative fare outlook underscoring the winter, and with potential share buybacks providing a 
floor valuation, we think there remains considerably less uncertainty for Ryanair shares than the wider European 
airline sector" concluded the analysts. 
Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on Ryanair, with a price target of EUR14.00. 
Ryanair shares were up 0.3% at EUR11.94 a share Friday afternoon.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said Ryanair's "load factor-active, yield-passive" 
business model should be able to generate its forecast of EUR1.4 billion net profit for its current financial year, 
despite challenges within the low-cost airline sector.
Furlong said the budget airline operator remains 1% better booked compared to last year, as it drives volumes in a 
"soft" market. Davy said weaker yields, guided down 8% in the group's second half, could be "a point or so worse", 
but should be offset by higher loads, better costs and improved ancillaries. 
Davy said it believes Ryanair will achieve a net profit in line with Davy's forecast of EUR1.4 billion for its current 
financial year. Furlong said free cash generation of around EUR1.0 billion should result in further buybacks at 
current valuations. Ryanair's recent extraordinary general meeting gave the board discretion to buy back a further 
10% of its issued share capital.
The analyst said growth "remains the theme", even following the the UK's decision to leave the European Union, 
with further acceleration of growth in Italy and potential expansion in Germany. Furlong said Ryanair's target is to 
be at least the number-two player, if not the number-one, in the market share of every market in which it operates, 
with the possible exception of France. 
Furlong said said Ryanair is currently the largest airline website worldwide and, and the ninth largest website in the 
overall travel sector. 
Ryanair expects to reach 180 million customers by the end of its 2024 financial year, but Furlong said with long-
term deals with pilots and cabin crew, dependent on the aircraft disposal programme and aircraft residual values, 
the company could reach 200 million customers. In its "typical low-cost way", the analyst said, Ryanair's spend on 
marketing is 16 euro cents per passenger.
Davy said it believes it is likely Ryanair will raise its "long-held target" of 20% of total revenue in ancillaries, which is 
currently running ahead at 24%, to 30% in November. 
IN THE KNOW: Davy Says Ryanair Model Prepared For Soft Airline Market
Furlong said Ryanair's focus now lies in acquisitions, cross-selling, and the personalisation of its customer base. 
The company said it aims to do this through customer relationship management, mobile expansion, and product 
improvement. 
Davy maintained its Outperform rating on Ryanair with a price target of EUR14.00. Shares in the company were up 
0.5% at EUR11.97.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Davy analyst Ross Harvey said budget airline operator Ryanair is a "structural winner" 
compared to other low-cost airline operators, having seen continued passenger growth in July, and being in line to 
meet full-year guidance.
The analyst said Ryanair stands out as "the most compelling investment case" at current share price levels, due to 
its structural growth and defensiveness in a challenging travel market, hit by terror attacks and air traffic control 
strikes in France.
Harvey said Ryanair has continued to see strong volume growth, the number of customers it carried grew by 12% in 
July to 11.3 million from 10.1 million in the same month the year prior. Load factor also rose in July by one 
percentage point to 96% from 95%.
Davy said it believes summer pricing will continue to be weak, but on an "improving trajectory", down by 4% on 
average. The analyst said Ryanair carries "the best cost momentum" out of its rivals into the second half of the 
year, and should be able to support full-year guidance against soft demand conditions.
Due to its strong relative cost and revenue trends, Davy said Ryanair is its top pick in the sector. Meanwhile, Davy 
recently cut its price targets for Lufthansa, Wizz Air, and downgraded Air France-KLM to Neutral from Outperform.
Harvey said, however, of its Neutral recommendations, easyJet has the most to gain in 2017 should external 
disruptions ease. Davy cut easyJet's price target to 1,100 pence from 1,240p on Monday.
Davy said its EUR14.00 price target for Ryanair is based on 13x profit to earnings ratio, and the broker maintained 
its Outperform rating.
Shares in Ryanair were up 1.2% Monday morning at EUR12.14

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it will accelerate its growth plans for Italy 
after the Italian government decided to reverse tax increases and issued revised airport guidelines.
The low-cost airline said it "warmly welcomes" the initiatives taken by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to reverse 
the EUR2.50 municipal tax increase from September 1, as well as the government's revised airport guidelines, 
which will enable Italy's regional airports to "compete on a level playing field" with airports in Rome and Milan, 
according to Ryanair.
These initiatives have allowed Ryanair to reach a new growth agreement with Pescara airport, reversing the 
previously-announced closure of the Pescara base, and it hopes to conclude a similar deal with Alghero airport, 
which may allow the Alghero base to reopen in late November.
As a result of the initiatives, Ryanair will also accelerate its growth plans for the Italian market in 2017, under which 
it will invest over USD1 billion in 10 new aircraft, while introducing 44 new routes. Ryanair expects this to deliver 3 
million new passengers a year, which will be a 10% increase year-on-year in 2017, with 2,250 jobs to be created.
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 0.4% at EUR11.87 on Wednesday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Cantor said it believes easyJet's financial strength should allow it to retain its significant 
market share, despite a "challenging" short-haul European flight market, as it upgraded the low-cost airline to Buy 
from Hold.
Cantor analyst Robin Byde acknowledged recent trading has been mixed for easyJet. In its third quarter update in 
July, the company reported an increase in passenger numbers and a high loading rate, at 92%, but yields were 
down by over 8%. 
Its July traffic statement, the first following the UK's decision to leave the European Union, reported passengers up 
a "healthy" 6.7% with loading at 96%.
easyJet has signalled it will largely maintain its capacity expansion plans, and Byde said the airline should be able 
to use its financial strength to increase its market share and discount "aggressively" to remain competitive in an 
"oversupplied" and "challenging" short-haul European flight market. 
Byde also said access to European airspace post-Brexit will be achievable, even if airlines are unsuccessful in 
lobbying for the continuation for a single European aviation market. He said the next acceptable outcome would be 
for easyJet to apply for an Air Operator Certificate in an EU Country to exist alongside its UK and Swiss certificates, 
and this would not be particularly expensive or complex to achieve.
The Cantor analyst said he views flag carrier airlines as easyJet's main competition due to the company's focus on 
primary airports, but budget carriers are more likely to lead expansion in the coming months. easyJet has an 
approximate 7% route overlap with Ryanair, but this rises to 30% when measured on a city to city basis, instead of 
comparing routes operating from the same airports.
Overlap with other budget carriers, such as Wizz Air and IAG's Vueling, "remains minor".
Byde said he sees plenty of options for easyJet expansion within the European short-haul network. Over the next 
few years, he said the key growth markets for easyJet will be UK London airports, Amsterdam Schiphol, Venice

Marco Polo, and Milan Malpensa. Byde also said "sunshine getaways" should be an area of expansion for the 
company. 
The analyst said he believes travel spend in the UK and across Europe is unlikely to see a sharp downturn in the 
coming months. He said concerns surrounding the travel market to have been "overdone", and European travel is 
likely to be "more resilient" than some investors fear.
Byde said easyJet's current valuation is attractive, as its stock is down 40% in the year to date, and so is "a good 
time to buy". Cantor increased its target price for easyJet to 1300 pence from 1200p. 
Shares in the company were up 3.1% Tuesday at 1,070.97p.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group SA on Thursday said group traffic, capacity 
and premium traffic all rose in July, as it made progress on the expansion of Aer Lingus' transatlantic network. 
IAG - which owns British Airways, Ireland's Aer Lingus, and Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling - said its group 
traffic measured by revenue passenger kilometres rose 16% when compared to a year earlier. Group capacity 
measured in available seat kilometres also rose 14%.
On a pro-forma basis, traffic rose 5.6%, whilst capacity rose 4.6%. Group premium traffic rose 6.1% in July, also on 
a pro-forma basis.
Meanwhile, load factor rose 1.1 percentage points to 86.8% when compared with a year earlier. On a pro-forma 
basis, this was a 0.8% rise.
IAG reported the traffic figures on a pro-forma basis to adjust for its acquisition of Aer Lingus last August.
In July, IAG said it had converted two Airbus 330-300 long-haul aircraft options into firm orders for Aer Lingus. On 
Thursday the company said these aircraft will be delivered in 2017, which will facilitate expansion on Aer Lingus' 
transatlantic network.
Shares in IAG were up 1.6% at 394.40p on Thursday afternoon. 
Low-cost airline easyJet PLC earlier Thursday had reported reported growth in both passenger numbers and load 
factor year-on-year in July, whilst on Wednesday, rival budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings 
PLC also had reported their traffic statistics for the month.
Irish carrier Ryanair Wednesday said the number of customers it carried grew by 12%, as load factor rose by one 
percentage point to 96% from 95%, whilst Wizz Air reported a 16% rise in passengers, while load factor remained 
flat at 92.7%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday maintained its profit guidance for 
its current financial year but said Brexit has increased the downside risks it faces and will put pressure on fares until 
at least the end of 2017.
Ryanair said it still expects profit after tax for the year to the end of March 2017 to be between EUR1.375 billion and 
EUR1.425 billion, up from EUR1.24 billion the year before, but it said there are "significant risks to the downside" for 
the remainder of the year due to Brexit. Ryanair had been a prominent campaigner for the UK to remain in the 
European Union.
On average, the carrier said it is 1.0% better-booked for the second quarter, to the end of September, than at the 
same time a year earlier, but at "significantly lower fares". Average fares have been hit by air traffic control strikes in 
France, terror attacks in Europe, and the weakness in sterling post-Brexit, it said. 
For the first quarter, average fares fell 10% year-on-year, Ryanair said, offset by a 9.0% fall in unit costs.
As a result of these factors, Ryanair said it expects fares to decline by around 6.0% year-on-year in the second 
quarter, and it said the outcome for the first half will be heavily dependent on August and September bookings. 
Ryanair said it has little visibility on fares for the winter season but held its guidance for a decline of 10% to 12%, 
with any movement in this guidance skewed to the downside.
For the first quarter to the end of June, Ryanair said it made a post-tax profit of EUR256.0 million, up 4.0% from the 
EUR245.0 million made a year earlier, as revenue grew 2.0% to EUR1.69 billion from EUR1.65 billion.
The airline carried 31.2 million customers in the quarter, up 11% from 28.0 million a year prior, and it maintained its 
guidance for full-year customer traffic to grow 10%. Ryanair's load factor improved by 2 percentage points year-on-
year to 94%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings' first quarter results came in below expectations 
but Liberum is confident the company will be a long-term winner in the European airline sector.
For the first quarter to the end of June, Ryanair said it made a post-tax profit of EUR256.0 million, up 4.0% from the 
EUR245.0 million made a year earlier. This missed the consensus forecast of EUR260.0 million and Liberum's 
estimate of EUR274.0 million. 
"The Q1 results were marginally light of consensus, with some headwinds from operational disruption, with air traffic 
control strikes the main issue," said Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo. 
Ryanair maintained its profit guidance for its current financial year but said Brexit has increased the downside risks 
it faces and will put pressure on fares until at least the end of 2017.
Khoo said the unchanged profit guidance will please the market, considering the profit warnings elsewhere in the 
industry. The short-term Brexit risks are concerning, but the analyst argues this could be priced in already with 
shares in the company down 20% since the UK's vote to leave the European Union last month. 
"The outlook for the next 18 months is undoubtedly uncertain. However, we consider Ryanair's exposure to the UK 
to be manageable and its market-leading position, low costs and strong balance sheet leave it well positioned to 
ultimately benefit from any economic slowdown," the analyst said. 
"Past downturns have seen Ryanair make strategic progress as the exit or shrinking of weaker competitors has 
been accelerated. We expect a flight to value amongst consumers and a flight to quality amongst investors, both of 
which favour Ryanair," Khoo added. 
Liberum maintained its Buy rating and EUR13.50 price target. 
On Friday, the stock closed down 1.2% at EUR10.905.

IN DEPTH: Ryanair Will Pivot Growth Away From UK Following Brexit Vote
IN DEPTH: Ryanair Will Pivot Growth Away From UK Following Brexit Vote

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it will pivot growth away from 
UK airports and focus more on its other airport bases in the European Union over the next two years, following the 
UK's decision to leave the EU.
This follows rival low-cost airline Wizz Air's announcement last week that it had started readjusting its network and 
halving its intended growth to the UK for the second half of its financial year. Wizz Air plans to redeploy this 
capacity to non-UK routes.
Wizz Air decided to do this due to weakness in the pound caused by the Brexit vote reducing fares in euro terms on 
routes to and from the UK.
Ryanair, which had been an active campaigner to remain in the EU, said the Brexit vote was "both a surprise and a 
disappointment" and has resulted in the group cutting capacity and frequency on many London Stansted routes this 
winter. According to the airline, it is already significantly ahead of its multi-year traffic growth targets at Stansted, 
adding that it will not be closing any routes to and from the airport.
Ryanair said it expects the Brexit vote to lead to a "considerable period of political and economic uncertainty" in 
both the UK and the EU, which will be "damaging" to both economic growth and consumer confidence, but that it 
will "respond as always" with its load factor active/yield passive strategy.
It added that it expects Brexit uncertainty to lead to weaker sterling in the near term and downward pressure on 
fares until the end of 2017 at least. Over the longer term, if the UK is unable to negotiate access to the single 
market and open skies, it may have implications for Ryanair's three UK domestic routes and UK nationals on its 
share register, but those risks "are not material and will be manageable", it said.
There may also be some opportunities if its UK registered competitors are no longer permitted to operate within EU 
routes, or must divest their majority ownership of EU registered airlines, Ryanair added.
IN DEPTH: Ryanair Will Pivot Growth Away From UK Following Brexit Vote
"Until some clarity emerges over the next two years about the UK's long-term political and economic relationships 
with the EU, we will be unable to predict what effect it will have on our business and regulatory environment, but we 
have contingency plans in place for all eventualities," the company said in a statement.
In contrast to Ryanair and Wizz Air's decision to limit growth in the UK, peer easyJet PLC last week said it would 
continue to grow in the UK. easyJet's Chief Executive Carolyn McCall said the airline will "take advantage" of 
weaknesses in other airlines and will focus on growing in the UK rather than reducing capacity.
Despite the Brexit-driven caution and the downside risks Ryanair said it now faces, the airline maintained its profit 
guidance for its current financial year, saying it still expects profit after tax for the year to the end of March 2017 to 
be between EUR1.38 billion and EUR1.43 billion, up from EUR1.24 billion the year before. 
For the first quarter to the end of June, Ryanair made a post-tax profit of EUR256.0 million, up 4% from the 
EUR245.0 million made a year earlier, as revenue grew 2% to EUR1.69 billion from EUR1.65 billion.
Profit missed the consensus forecast of EUR260.0 million, but Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo was pleased that 
Ryanair maintained its full-year guidance, given the profit warnings issued elsewhere in the industry.
Last week, easyJet said sterling weakness is likely to hit its full-year earnings by around GBP80 million, although 
Wizz Air, like Ryanair, maintained its full-year guidance.
Ryanair carried 31.2 million customers in the quarter, up 11% from 28.0 million a year prior, and it increased its 
guidance for full-year customer traffic by 1 million to grow by 10% to 117 million customers. Ryanair's load factor 
improved by 2 percentage points year-on-year to 94% in the quarter.
Average fares, however, fell by 10% year-on-year, having been hit by the weakness in sterling following the EU 
referendum and also by air traffic control strikes in France and the string of terrorist attacks in Europe and North 
Africa over the past year. These factors caused almost 1,000 flight cancellations, Ryanair said, although a 9.0% fall 
in unit costs managed to offset the decline in fares.
Looking ahead to the second quarter to the end of September, Ryanair said it is 1% better-booked on average than 
at the same time a year earlier, but at "significantly lower fares". 
As a result, Ryanair said it expects fares to decline by around 6% year-on-year in the second quarter, and that the 
outcome for the first half will be heavily dependent on August and September bookings. Ryanair said it has little 
visibility on fares for the winter season but held its guidance for a decline of 10% to 12%, with any movement in this 
guidance skewed to the downside.
Ryanair added that its four new bases in Belfast, Corfu, Ibiza and Santiago are performing well, with strong 
advance bookings. It will open 133 new routes during the winter season.
Liberum's Khoo said the short-term Brexit risks are concerning for Ryanair, but argued that this could be priced in 
already with shares in the company down 20% since the referendum last month.
"The outlook for the next 18 months is undoubtedly uncertain. However, we consider Ryanair's exposure to the UK 
to be manageable and its market-leading position, low costs and strong balance sheet leave it well positioned to 
ultimately benefit from any economic slowdown," the analyst said.
"Past downturns have seen Ryanair make strategic progress as the exit or shrinking of weaker competitors has 
been accelerated. We expect a flight to value amongst consumers and a flight to quality amongst investors, both of 
which favour Ryanair," Khoo added. 
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 6% at EUR11.55 on Monday afternoon. easyJet shares were down 0.9% to 
1,018 pence and Wizz Air shares were up 3.6% to 1,480p.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Analysts were positive on Ryanair Holdings even as the budget airline highlighted 
"significant risks to the downside" following Brexit, with Davy saying the group's caution is "justified", while Cantor 
Fitzgerald said the results demonstrate "resilience" in the business model. 
For the first quarter to the end of June, Ryanair said it made a post-tax profit of EUR256.0 million, up 4.0% from the 
EUR245.0 million made a year earlier, as revenue grew 2.0% to EUR1.69 billion from EUR1.65 billion.
Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said the company's quality "shines through", with the reported post-tax profit above 
the broker's expectations of EUR242.30 million, but slightly below consensus estimates of EUR260.0 million. 
Ryanair said it still expects profit after tax for the year to the end of March 2017 to be between EUR1.375 billion and 
EUR1.425 billion, up from EUR1.24 billion the year before, but it said there are "significant risks to the downside" for 
the remainder of the year due to Brexit. Ryanair had been a prominent campaigner for the UK to remain in the 
European Union.
Davy's Furlong said the "cautious early summer guidance" is "justified", with the broker retaining its expectations at 
EUR1.40 billion, in line with consensus numbers. 
"We are unlikely to change forecasts and maintain our EUR14.00 price target", said Furlong, with Davy's 
recommendation retained at Outperform. Following the trading update, Ryanair shares were up 5.6% at EUR11.51 
Monday morning. 
Furlong noted Ryanair has three domestic UK routes out of 1,800, and the analyst expects risks to be 
"manageable".

"It will pivot growth away from UK airports and focus on growing at EU airports over the next two years. Capacity 
and frequency will be cut this winter at Stansted airport where the company is already significantly ahead of multi-
year traffic growth targets," noted the Davy analyst. 
Cantor analyst Robin Byde said "these results demonstrate the resilience of the Ryanair business model and we 
expect consensus forecast to be unchanged at this time". 
Cantor kept a Hold stance and put its EUR15.5 price target Under Review, saying that "the stock is not expensive". 
Ryanair is expected to release its half-year results on November 7.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UK equities started higher on Monday, with shares in William Hill boosted after peers 
888 Holdings and The Rank Group confirmed they are evaluating a possible offer for the FTSE 250-listed 
bookmaker. 
Both 888 and Rank Group said they see "significant industrial logic" in the combination with William Hill, "through 
consolidation of their complementary online and land-based operations, delivery of substantial revenue and cost 
synergies and from the anticipated benefits of economies of scale which will accrue to all shareholders".
The pair have not made a formal approach yet and said there can be no certainty that any such approach will be 
made.
In a separate statement, William Hill confirmed that it received "a highly preliminary approach" from 888 and Rank 
Group regarding the potential combination, but that the consortium did not put forward a proposal or set out a 
position on price, timing, terms, form of consideration, or transaction structure.
"The board of William Hill would listen to and consider any proposal which might be forthcoming from the 
consortium," William Hill said. 
Shares in William Hill were up 9.4%, while 888 was up 2.9% and Rank Group up 2.6%. 
The FTSE 100 was up 1.9 points, at 6,732.38. The FTSE 250 was up 0.3% at 17,026.47, and the AIM All-Share 
was up 0.3% at 742.05.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 index in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were both up 0.1% .
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo ended slightly lower, the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.1%, and the Hang 
Seng in Hong Kong continues down 0.1%.

Elsewhere in UK company news, Randgold Resources led FTSE 100 fallers, down 2.2%. The gold miner said the 
Tongon mine in the Ivory Coast is expected to deliver an "improved performance" in the second half of this year 
after the miner finished expanding and upgrading certain elements of the plant.
The company said it has completed the expansion of the crusher unit and an upgrade of the mill circuit. It also dealt 
with an extended down time at one of the mills as a result of poor repairs to the journal and slipper pads earlier this 
year, Randgold said.
The mill had been down for 46 days in total, which "impacted heavily on production", and the mine also was dealing 
with "an erratic power supply" from the national grid. However, Randgold said a constructive engagement with the 
power utility was significantly improving the situation.
Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings was up 5.7% after it maintained its profit guidance for its current financial year 
but said Brexit has increased the downside risks it faces and will put pressure on fares until at least the end of 
2017.
Ryanair still expects profit after tax for the year to the end of March 2017 to be between EUR1.375 billion and 
EUR1.425 billion, up from EUR1.24 billion the year before, but it said there are "significant risks to the downside" for 
the remainder of the year due to Brexit. Ryanair had been a prominent campaigner for the UK to remain in the

On average, the carrier said it is 1.0% better-booked for the second quarter, to the end of September, than at the 
same time a year earlier, but at "significantly lower fares". Average fares have been hit by air traffic control strikes in 
France, terror attacks in Europe, and the weakness in sterling post-Brexit, it said. 
The economic calendar is quite thin with IFO business climate surveys for Germany at 0900 BST and the 
Confederation of British Industry's trends survey at 1100 BST. In the afternoon, the Dallas Fed manufacturing 
business index is at 1530 BST.

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - Early indications suggest that Wall Street stocks may open Monday's session on 
a slightly positive note, even as the averages trade either at record high or near highs. Asian stocks ended on a 
lackluster note, while as stocks opened in Europe, some encouragement came from positive earnings from 
companies such as Philips and Ryanair and a German business sentiment reading. Commodities are weaker but 
the dollar is mixed. The domestic markets could react to the direction of commodity prices, some earnings news 
flow and M&A news if any.
As of 6:15 am ET, the Dow futures are adding 5 points and the S&P 500 futures are gaining 0.25 point while the 
Nasdaq 100 futures are moving down 2.25 points.
US stocks extended the gains in the week ended July 22nd, rising for four straight weeks, as earnings optimism 
helped to overcome valuation concerns and fears concerning the economic uncertainty.
Housing, consumer, durable goods orders and GDP data along with the FOMC meeting are likely to headline the 
economic events of the week. The 2-day FOMC meeting that begins on Tuesday, the advance second quarter GDP 
data due on Friday, the Commerce Department's new home sales report for June scheduled to be released on 
Tuesday and the Commerce Department's durable goods orders report set to be released on Wednesday are 
among the closely focused reports/events of the week.
Traders may also sift through the jobless claims report, the National Association of Realtors' pending home sales 
index for June, the results of MNI's Chicago business barometer survey for July, some Fed speeches, the 
Conference Board's consumer confidence index for July, final estimate of the University of Michigan's consumer 
sentiment index for July. The results of some regional manufacturing surveys, the results of S&P/Case-Shiller 
house price survey for May and the results of the Treasury auctions of 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes round up the 
economic events of the week.
The Dallas Federal Reserve is scheduled to release its regional general activity index for July at 10:30 am ET. 
Economists expect the index to improve to -12 from -18.3 in June.
Wall Street Set To Start Data-Heavy Week On Subdued Note
The Treasury is set to announce the results of its auction of 2-year notes at 1 pm ET.
Reports suggest that Yahoo (YHOO) may be close to announcing a deal to sell its core search assets to Verizon 
(VZ).
Liberty Interactive (LVNTA, LVNTA) announced that it has completed the spin-off of its subsidiary CommerceHub 
and accordingly Liberty and CommerceHub will trade as separate public companies, with the latter trading under 
the symbol CHUBB on July 25th, 2016 on the OTC Markets.
Crane (CR), EverestRe (RE), Express Scripts (ESRX), Gilead Sciences (GILD), J&J Snack Foods (JJSF), Las 
Vegas Sands (LVS), Sanmina (SANM), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Waste Connections (WCN) are among the 
companies due to release their quarterly results after the close of trading.
The major Asian markets ended mixed, as the commodity retreat and lackluster risk sentiment weighed on the 
averages. The Singaporean, Japanese and Taiwanese markets retreated, while the rest of the major markets 
advanced.
The Japanese market ended marginally lower, as the yen selling stalled. The Nikkei 225 average ended down 6.96 
points or 0.04% at 16,620, dropping for the second straight session. Australia's All Ordinaries hovered in positive 
territory throughout the session, ending up 33.20 points or 0.60% at 5,608, its highest level since August 5th, 2015.
China's Shanghai Composite ended 3.01 points or 0.10% higher at 3,016. Staging a recovery in the final few 
minutes of trading, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at 21,993, up 29.17 points or 0.13%. On the economic 
front, final estimates released by Japan's Cabinet Office showed that a leading economic indicators index for Japan 
fell in May. The index declined to 99.7 in May from 100 in April, while the flash estimate was at 100. The coincident 
index fell to the lowest reading since August 2013 and the lagging economic indicators index also moved down 2.4 
points to 112.9.
The Ministry of Finance reported that the nation's trade surplus came in more than expected in June. The trade 
surplus came in at 692.84 billion yen in June compared to a deficit of 40.6 billion deficit in May. Economists 
expected a surplus of 474.4 billion yen. Exports fell a less than expected 7.4% year-over-year and imports slumped 
18.8%.
European stocks rose notably, as traders digest positive corporate results and a German business sentiment 
reading, which fell less than expected.
In major corporate news, Philips reported better than expected earnings for the second quarter, helped by cost 
savings. The company also expects further earnings improvement in the second half of the year. Ryanair reported a 
modest increase in first quarter profits but maintained its forecast for the full year despite the Brexit and terrorist 
threat overhangs. On the economic front, the results of a survey by IfO showed that German business sentiment 
weakened in July. The business climate index fell 0.4 points to 108.3 in July, while economists expected a worse 
decline to 107.5. The expectations index declined 0.9 points to 102.2 compared to the consensus estimate of 101.1, 
while the current conditions index rose 0.7 points to 114.7.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets ended the first session of the new trading week with mixed 
results. The markets got off to a positive start Monday following the release of the better than expected German 
business sentiment report. However, the markets pared their gains in the afternoon.
The late reversal was partly due to the pullback in crude oil prices. Weakness in metal prices also weighed on 
mining stocks, while financial stocks also struggled. Investors were also in a cautious mood ahead of this week's 
policy meetings for both the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index dipped 0.01%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
increased 0.03%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.29%.
The DAX of Germany climbed 0.50% and the CAC 40 of France rose 0.16%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 
0.30%, but the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.00%.
In Paris, household equipment manufacturer SEB soared 7.07% after saying it expects to achieve an organic sales 
growth above 5% and an increase in operating result from activity above 10% in 2016.

USD650 million.
L'Oreal gained 0.37%. The cosmetics company has agreed to buy IT Cosmetics, one of the fastest growing prestige 
beauty brands in the US, for a cash purchase price of USD1.2 billion.
LafargeHolcim rose 0.35%. The cement giant has signed a pact with Siam City Cement Public Company Limited for 
the divestment of its interest in Holcim Lanka for an enterprise value of USD400 million.
Air France KLM fell 2.32% as its cabin crew unions prepare to begin a seven-day walkout this week.
European Markets Finished Mixed After Early Gains Eroded
In London, casino operator Rank Group dipped 0.51% and online gambling operator 888 Holdings gained 3.38%, 
while ailing bookmaker William Hill soared 4.85%. William Hill said it received a "highly preliminary" approach from 
888 Holdings and Rank Group regarding a potential combination.
Ryanair Holdings surged 6.33% after reiterating its fiscal 2017 profit forecast.
Aberdeen Asset Management advanced 0.60% after releasing its trading update for the nine months to June 30.
Consumer electronics giant Philips Electronics gained 2.10% in Amsterdam after backing its FY16 outlook.
Julius Baer Group climbed 2.91% in Zurich after the private banking group reported an increase in its first-half profit.
Mobile telecoms gear maker Ericsson AB rallied 3.45% in Stockholm as its chief executive Hans Vestberg stepped 
down with immediate effect after more than six years at the helm.
Germany's business sentiment weakened in July as the 'Brexit' vote made businesses less optimistic about their 
future. Nonetheless, they assessed a slight improvement in the current situation. The business climate index fell 
less-than-expected to 108.3 in July from 108.7 in June, survey results from the Munich-based Ifo economic institute 
showed Monday. The expected score was 107.5.
UK industrial orders declined further in July, the Industrial Trends Survey from the Confederation of British Industry 
showed Monday. The total order books balance dropped to -4% in July from -2% in June. The export order books 
declined notably to -22% from -14% in the prior month.
British business confidence plunged to its lowest level in seven-and-a-half years, after the surprise "Brexit" vote, 
survey results from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) showed Monday.
The quarterly CBI Industrial Trends survey showed that 52% of firms were less optimistic about the general 
business situation than three months ago, while 5% said they were more optimistic, giving a balance of -47.
That was the lowest figure since January 2009, when it was -64, the survey said. Optimism about export prospects 
for the year ahead also fell, down to -11.

IN THE KNOW: Uncertain Outlook To Weigh On easyJet Consensus Estimates
IN THE KNOW: Uncertain Outlook To Weigh On easyJet Consensus 
Estimates

LONDON (Alliance News) - easyJet's third-quarter update indicated uncertainty about trading for the remainder of 
the financial year, and analysts believe consensus estimates for the budget carrier will be lowered. 
easyJet on Thursday reported a fall in revenue in the third quarter of its financial year as flight cancellations 
resulting from terrorist attacks, bad weather and air traffic controller strikes offset a rise in seat capacity.
The number of passengers carried was boosted by an increase in capacity of 5.5% to 21.9 million seats, but 
revenue declined as the increased seat capacity was offset by the impact on yield of overall market capacity and 
cancellations as a result of "significant external events".
Those events included the terrorist attacks in Brussels in March and the crash of an Egyptair flight in May, as well 
as air traffic control strikes, runway closures at Gatwick airport, and severe weather. They led to 1,221 cancellations 
in the period for easyJet.
Numis analyst Wyn Ellis said the third quarter performance by easyJet was in-line with expectations, but the 
uncertain economic and operating outlook means the broker's full-year pretax profit forecast for the company is cut 
to GBP495.0 million from GBP612.0 million. In financial year 2015, easyJet made pretax profit of GBP686.0 million. 
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said the lack of full-year guidance from easyJet is "not reassuring and highlights the 
wide range of potential outcomes, even at this late stage of the year".
"easyJet is always reliant upon its performance in the peak summer season to deliver the FY performance, but 
even more so this year. The outlook appears uncertain and the headwinds strong," Khoo said. 
The uncertainty means the analyst sees downside risks the consensus full-year pretax profit estimate of GBP622.0 
million.
IN THE KNOW: Uncertain Outlook To Weigh On easyJet Consensus Estimates
Numis and Liberum kept their respective Hold ratings on the stock. Numis has a 1,200.00 pence price target, while 
Liberum has a 1,050.00p target. 
easyJet was the worst performer in the FTSE 100 Thursday morning, down 4.6% at 1,074.81p. The company's 
update dragged down peers, with Ryanair Holdings down 4.7% and International Consolidated Airlines Group down 
3.4%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - London stock prices started lower Thursday, with easyJet leading FTSE 100 fallers 
after it reported a fall in revenue in the third quarter of its financial year.
The low-cost airline said flight cancellations resulting from terrorist attacks, bad weather and air traffic control strikes 
offset a rise in seat capacity.
easyJet said total revenue in the quarter ended June 30 fell by 2.6% year-on-year to GBP1.20 billion, as revenue 
per seat declined by 7.7% to GBP54.54, despite the number of passengers carried rising by 5.8% to 20.2 million 
and load factor increasing by 0.3 percentage point to 92%.
easyJet said the number of passengers carried was boosted by an increase in capacity of 5.5% to 21.9 million 
seats, but revenue declined as the increased seat capacity was offset by the impact on yield of overall market 
capacity and cancellations as a result of "significant external events".
Those events included the terrorist attacks in Brussels in March and the crash of an Egyptair flight in May, as well 
as air traffic control strikes, runway closures at Gatwick airport, and severe weather. They led to 1,221 cancellations 
in the period.
easyJet traded down 5.9%, while peer Ryanair Holdings was down 2.5%. British Airways-owner International 
Consolidated Airlines Group was down 3.8%. 
The FTSE 100 index was off 0.3%, or 19.98 points, at 6,709.01. The FTSE 250 was down 0.2% at 16,984.26, but 
the AIM All-Share was up 0.1% at 737.00.
European markets were outperforming. The French CAC 40 index was up 0.1% and the German DAX 30 was up 
0.4%. 
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.8%, the Shanghai Composite ended up 0.4%, and the Hang 
Seng in Hong Kong continues up 0.9%.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: easyJet 's Dire Update Drags Down Airline Stocks
Leading the gainers in the FTSE 100 were mining stocks, rebounding from their declines from the last trading 
session. 
Joining the miners in the winning column was Unilever, up 0.6%. The consumer goods giant reported growth in 
profit in the first half of 2016, but said sales fell due to negative movements in foreign exchange rates. The Anglo-
Dutch company warned on tough market conditions for the remainder of the year.
Unilever said pretax profit in the first half grew by 0.8% to EUR3.64 billion from EUR3.61 billion a year before, but 
sales fell by 2.6% to EUR26.28 billion from EUR27.0 billion.
Unilever said consumer demand remained weak in the period with slowing volumes, but underlying sales were 
driven by market share gains across each of the four categories of Personal Care, Foods, Home Care and 
Refreshment. On a constant currency basis, sales rose by 5.4%.
In the FTSE 250, AO World was the top gainer, up 6.7%. AO World said it is on track with its long-term strategic 
plan, and expectations remain unchanged following the Brexit vote. 
Euromoney Institutional Investor said trading has been in line with its expectations in the third quarter, with no 
significant impact from Brexit.
The FTSE 250 company, which publishes trade magazines covering a range of business sectors and runs events, 
said revenue in the quarter to the end of June fell 1.0% year-on-year to GBP104.7 million.
Though Euromoney benefited from dollar strength against sterling following the Brexit vote, this was offset by lower 
revenue from the disposal of its Gulf Publishing and Petroleum Economist titles in April.
Underlying revenue, stripping out currency effects and disposals, fell 1.0% in the quarter, an improvement on the 
6.0% decline reported in the first half. The stock traded up 3.4%.
In the economic calendar, the main focus will be on the European Central Bank's monetary policy decision at 1245 
BST, and the subsequent press conference with President Mario Draghi at 1330 BST.
Elsewhere UK retail sales and public sector net borrowing are at 0930 BST, US initial and continuing jobless claims 
are at 1330 BST, the same time as Philadelphia Fed Survey and the Chicago Fed national activity index.

LONDON (Alliance News) - easyJet PLC Chief Executive Carolyn McCall on Thursday said the budget airline will 
continue to grow in the UK and will not reduce capacity there despite uncertainty caused by the UK's decision to 
leave the European Union.
Shares in easyJet were down 5.0% at 1,071.00 pence on Thursday morning, the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, 
followed by British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines Group, down 3.5%. Outside the FTSE 100, 
direct competitor Ryanair was down 4.8%.
McCall's comments came a day after rival budget airline Wizz Air PLC said it has started readjusting its network 
and halving its intended growth to the UK for the second half of its financial year, planning to redeploy this capacity 
to non-UK routes.
Wizz Air decided to do this due to weakness in the pound caused by the Brexit vote reducing fares in euro terms on 
routes to and from the UK. Wizz Air shares were down 4.1% Thursday. 
On Thursday, however, McCall told journalists that easyJet will "take advantage" of weaknesses in other airlines 
and will focus on growing in the UK rather than reducing capacity.
Earlier Thursday, easyJet reported a fall in revenue in the third quarter of its financial year as flight cancellations 
resulting from terrorist attacks, bad weather and air traffic control strikes offset a rise in seat capacity.
The low-cost airline said total revenue in the quarter ended June 30 fell by 2.6% year-on-year to GBP1.20 billion, as 
revenue per seat declined by 7.7% to GBP54.54, despite the number of passengers carried rising by 5.8% to 20.2 
million and load factor increasing by 0.3 percentage point to 92%.
easyJet said the number of passengers carried was boosted by an increase in capacity of 5.5% to 21.9 million 
seats, but revenue declined as the increased seat capacity was offset by the impact on yield of overall market 
capacity and cancellations as a result of "significant external events".
EXTRA: easyJet "Will Grow In UK" Despite Brexit As Revenue Takes Hit
Those events included the terrorist attacks in Brussels in March and the crash of an Egyptair flight in May, as well 
as air traffic control strikes, runway closures at Gatwick airport, and severe weather. 
They led to 1,221 cancellations in the period, up from 726 a year earlier, while disrupted passengers were allocated 
seats that normally would have been sold close to departure for a higher yield, hitting revenue per seat.
June was the worst hit, with easyJet suffering from 852 cancellations and 11 air traffic control strikes.
In addition, a shift in capacity to the western Mediterranean and away from the Middle East and North Africa as led 
to an over-supply of seat capacity in those two markets, reducing yields.
easyJet added that approximately 65% of expected bookings for the fourth quarter have now been secured, with 
booked average revenue per seat declining by around 7.5% at constant currency, noting that the terrorist attack in 
Nice, France and attempted military coup in Turkey last week have given rise to an uncertain revenue per seat 
trajectory for the fourth quarter.
Capacity in the fourth quarter is expected to grow by 6%.
"More recently currency volatility as a result of the UK's referendum decision to leave the EU as well as the recent 
events in Turkey and Nice continue to impact consumer confidence," Chief Executive Carolyn McCall said in a 
statement, referring to the failed military coup in Turkey last weekend and the proceeding terror attack in France.
easyJet's comments were echoed by German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG, which also reported a fall in revenue 
in its latest results statement on Thursday, posting a decline to EUR15 billion in the first half of 2016 from EUR15.4 
billion the year before.
Lufthansa noted that advance bookings, especially on long-haul routes to Europe, declined significantly due to the 
terrorist attacks which have plagued Europe in the past year, as well as "greater political and economic 
uncertainty". As a result, Lufthansa lowered its full-year earnings forecast, expecting revenue to fall in the second 
half, while also cutting its capacity growth plans.
easyJet's McCall said: "The easyJet business model remains robust, with a strong cash position, solid balance 
sheet and a flexible fleet plan. The easyJet team is confident in its ability to navigate the period ahead and drive 
long-term advantage."

LONDON (Alliance News) - easyJet PLC Chief Executive Carolyn McCall on Thursday said the budget airline will 
continue to grow in the UK and will not reduce capacity there despite uncertainty caused by the UK's decision to 
leave the European Union.
Shares in easyJet were down 5.7% at 1,063.09 pence on Thursday, the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, dragging 
down with it British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines Group, down 3.7%. Outside the FTSE 100, 
direct competitor Ryanair was down 4.6%.
McCall's comments came a day after rival budget airline Wizz Air PLC said it has started readjusting its network 
and halving its intended growth to the UK for the second half of its financial year, planning to redeploy this capacity 
to non-UK routes.
Wizz Air decided to do this due to weakness in the pound caused by the Brexit vote reducing fares in euro terms on 
routes to and from the UK. Wizz Air shares were down 5.5% on Thursday. 
However, McCall told journalists that easyJet will "take advantage" of weaknesses in other airlines and will focus on 
growing in the UK rather than reducing capacity.
Immediately after it was revealed that the UK would be leaving the EU, easyJet released a statement saying Brexit 
would not have a "material impact" on its ability to deliver long-term sustainable earnings growth, although three 
days later it released another statement saying the referendum result would hit revenue per seat in the second half 
of the year.
McCall also revealed on Thursday that easyJet has, for the first time, had to promote seats for June and July, 
having never had to promote flights over the summer before. She did say, though, that marketing actions to 
stimulate demand have increased the number of passengers flying with the airline.
Since the referendum result, easyJet has mobilised a team which is actively engaging with regulators and the UK 
government to secure European flying rights, as well as planning to obtain an EU Airline Operator Certificate in

case the UK government fails to achieve "the desired outcome" of a continuation of a "liberalised and deregulated" 
aviation market in its Brexit talks with EU leaders.
A press report that easyJet may relocate its Luton headquarters to outside the UK as a result of this was quashed 
by the company earlier this month.
easyJet also noted on Thursday its hedging policy, which is aimed at reducing short-term earnings volatility from 
negative exchange rate movements. The airline hedges between 65% and 85% of the next 12 months and between 
45% and 65% of the following 12 months.
It said the recent weakness in the pound is likely to hit earnings by around GBP80 million for the full year, having 
previously predicted a GBP55 million hit in May.
Earlier on Thursday, easyJet reported a fall in revenue in the third quarter of its financial year as flight cancellations 
resulting from terrorist attacks, bad weather and air traffic control strikes offset a rise in seat capacity.
The low-cost airline said total revenue in the quarter ended June 30 fell by 2.6% year-on-year to GBP1.20 billion, as 
revenue per seat declined by 7.7% to GBP54.54, despite the number of passengers carried rising by 5.8% to 20.2 
million and load factor increasing by 0.3 percentage point to 92%.
easyJet said the number of passengers carried was boosted by an increase in capacity of 5.5% to 21.9 million 
seats, but revenue declined as the increased seat capacity was offset by the impact on yield of overall market 
capacity and cancellations as a result of "significant external events".
Those events included the terrorist attacks in Brussels in March - when suicide bombers detonated explosives at 
one of the city's airports and at a metro station - and the crash of an Egyptair flight en route to Cairo from Paris in 
May, as well as air traffic control strikes, runway closures at Gatwick airport, and severe weather. 
They led to 1,221 cancellations in the period, up from 726 a year earlier. What's more, disrupted passengers were 
allocated seats that normally would have been sold close to departure for a higher yield, hitting revenue per seat.
June was the worst hit, with easyJet suffering from 852 cancellations and 11 air traffic control strikes.
easyJet had warned in May that third-quarter revenue per seat would decline by around seven percentage points as 
a result of the Brussels attacks.
In addition, a shift in capacity to the western Mediterranean and away from the Middle East and North Africa has led 
to an over-supply of seat capacity in those two markets, reducing yields.
Airlines and travel companies have been shifting capacity away from destinations in North Africa and other 
countries that have been targets of terrorism, following on from a mass shooting at a Tunisian beach resort in June 
2015 and downing of a Russian passenger jet shortly after it took off from the popular Egyptian holiday resort of 
Sharm el Sheikh last October.
Those events, plus attacks by gunmen and suicide bombers in Paris last November and continued political turmoil 
in Turkey, have caused a massive blow to the travel industry, as consumer confidence to travel abroad has 
weakened.
McCall told journalists that capacity to Egypt has now been reduced to zero after flights to Sharm el Sheikh were 
cancelled, while Turkey has been reduced to just under 1% of overall capacity.  Instead capacity is increasing to 
destinations in the Western Mediterranean, although France remains at between 18% and 20% of overall capacity.
easyJet said overall market capacity on beach routes is growing by 14% year-on-year, with the most popular 
destinations including Malaga and Alicante.
IN DEPTH: easyJet To "Grow In UK" Despite Brexit But Weak Pound Hurts
easyJet added that approximately 65% of expected bookings for the fourth quarter have now been secured, with 
booked average revenue per seat declining by around 7.5% at constant currencies. 
It noted that the terrorist attack in Nice in France - in which a lorry driver deliberately drove into a crowd of people 
celebrating Bastille Day - and the attempted military coup in Turkey last week have resulted in an uncertain revenue 
per seat trajectory for the fourth quarter.
Capacity in the fourth quarter is expected to grow by 6%.
"More recently currency volatility as a result of the UK's referendum decision to leave the EU as well as the recent 
events in Turkey and Nice continue to impact consumer confidence," McCall said in the company's statement.
easyJet's comments were echoed by German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG, which also reported a fall in revenue 
in its latest results statement on Thursday, posting a decline to EUR15 billion in the first half of 2016 from EUR15.4 
billion the year before.
Lufthansa noted that advance bookings, especially on long-haul routes to Europe, declined significantly due to the 
terrorist attacks as well as "greater political and economic uncertainty". As a result, Lufthansa lowered its full-year 
earnings forecast, expecting revenue to fall in the second half, while also cutting its capacity growth plans.
easyJet's McCall, however, has always taken an optimistic stance on the industry in the aftermath of each of the 
terrorist attacks which have plagued Europe and North Africa over the past year. She remains defiant that while the 
travel industry will always suffer a steep reduction in demand immediately following on from an attack, consumer 
confidence will always recover.
"The easyJet business model remains robust, with a strong cash position, solid balance sheet and a flexible fleet 
plan. The easyJet team is confident in its ability to navigate the period ahead and drive long-term advantage," she 
said on Thursday.
While admitting that "this is, for airlines, one of the most difficult periods we've seen in a very long time", McCall 
added that "there are always opportunities when things are tough".
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo was less optimistic, saying the lack of full-year guidance is "not reassuring and 
highlighting the wide range of potential outcomes, even at this late stage of the year".
"easyJet is always reliant upon its performance in the peak summer season to deliver the full-year performance, but 
even more so this year. The outlook appears uncertain and the headwinds strong," Khoo said. 
easyJet's financial year ends on September 30.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
on Thursday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
Ashtead Group, up 3.7%. The equipment rental company was trading after after US peer United Rentals affirmed its 
outlook for 2016 following a strong second quarter, sending its shares higher on Wednesday. Ashtead's shares 
often move based on trading updates from United Rentals due to Ashtead's high exposure to the US market 
through its Sunbelt business.
----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
----------
easyJet, down 5.0%. The low-cost carrier reported a fall in revenue in the third quarter of its financial year as flight 
cancellations resulting from terrorist attacks, bad weather and air traffic control strikes offset a rise in seat capacity. 
easyJet said total revenue in the quarter ended June 30 fell by 2.6% year-on-year to GBP1.20 billion, as revenue 
per seat declined by 7.7% to GBP54.54, despite the number of passengers carried rising by 5.8% to 20.2 million 
and load factor increasing by 0.3 percentage point to 92%. Iberia and British Airways parent International 
Consolidated Airlines Group was also down 3.4% and mid-cap central and eastern Europe-focused airline Wizz Air 
Holdings was down 4.3%. Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings also sunk, down 4.6%.
Land Securities Group, down 1.7%. The commercial property investor said it anticipates uncertainty in the business 
world will persist until some clarity emerges on a post-Brexit UK. Robert Noel, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 
constituent, speaking ahead of Land Securities' annual general meeting, said that until clarity is provided on the 
timing and terms of the UK's exit from the European Union, uncertainty will persist. He added he anticipates this 
could "take some time".
WINNERS & LOSERS SUMMARY: AO World Up After Strong First Quarter
----------
FTSE 250 - WINNERS
----------
AO World, up 9.0%. The online household appliance retailer said it remains on track with its "long-term strategic 
plan" after a positive first quarter ended June 30. Year-on-year growth in AO branded UK sales were up 29%, and 
total UK revenue growth was up 25%. AO World said this was driven predominantly by "improving brand 
recognition". The company said "momentum" in the UK continued during its first quarter, particularly with gross 
margin and marketing costs. In Europe, the online retailer said progress was "pleasing". Revenue in euros doubled 
year-on-year, with "further advances" made in gross margins. AO World's expectations for the business in Europe 
over the financial year remained unchanged as a result.
William Hill, up 3.1%. The bookmaker said said Chief Executive James Henderson has stepped down from his role 
with immediate effect. Chief Financial Officer Philip Bowcock will step in as interim CEO, William Hill said, adding it 
has started a search for a permanent replacement for Henderson. Henderson took up the role of chief executive in 
August 2014. William Hill added trading remains in line with its expectations.
Close Brothers Group, up 1.9%. The financial services company said trading in the five months to the end of June 
was in line with its expectations. The company said it remains confident it will deliver a "solid" result for the year to 
the end of July 31. It will publish annual results on September 27. Close said its banking arm has continued to show 
good growth, with its overall loan book up 7.2% in the five-month period and up 12% for the eleven months to the 
end of July. Trading for the Winterflood securities business has continued to improve and was helped by the 
increase in trading volumes in the wake of the UK's decision to leave the European Union.
Euromoney Institutional Investor, up 1.5%. The business publisher said trading has been in line with its 
expectations in the third quarter, with no significant impact from Brexit. The group said revenue in the quarter to the 
end of June fell 1.0% year-on-year to GBP104.7 million. Though Euromoney benefited from dollar strength against 
sterling following the Brexit vote, this was offset by lower revenue from the disposal of its Gulf Publishing and 
Petroleum Economist titles in April. Underlying revenue, stripping out currency effects and disposals, fell 1.0% in 
the quarter, an improvement on the 6.0% decline reported in the first half.
----------
FTSE 250 - LOSERS
----------
CMC Markets, down 2.6%. The online retail trading firm said it does not anticipate a disruption to its business from 
the UK leaving the European Union, as it said it continued to make good progress in the first quarter. CMC said it 
saw continued robust levels of active clients and client applications in the first quarter to the end of June. Active 
clients at the end of June increased 13% year-on-year. The value of client trades, however, was lower in the 
quarter, in particular in the lead-up to the EU referendum in the UK. This resulted in a "moderate" fall in revenue per 
active client year-on-year. 
----------
MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Mission Marketing Group, up 11%. The marketing and advertising firm said it anticipates double-digit growth in 
profit and revenue for the first half. Mission expects profit and revenue in the half to the end of June will grow by 
double-digit percentages year-on-year, benefiting from organic growth and acquisitions made in the second half of 
2015. The group also anticipates further progress in the second half and said its results will be second-half 
weighted.
7Digital Group, up 7.3%. The digital music platform said it is confident of meeting its expectations for the full year 
following a positive first half trading update. Total monthly recurring revenue for the first half rose by 4% year-on-
year. Licensing revenue in June rose by 17% compared to the year before. 7digital additionally expects a debt 
repayment of GBP818,000 from music streaming service Guevara Ltd to be paid over the next 8 months. The 
WINNERS & LOSERS SUMMARY: AO World Up After Strong First Quarter
company also said it won contracts worth a combined value of GBP1.1 million in the second quarter, demand 
coming both from both new and existing customers, which should help the company reach its full year expectations.
----------
MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS
----------
Osirium Technologies, down 15%. The cyber security software provider said its pretax loss widened in the first half 
of its financial year on lower revenue, listing costs, and investments made in the business. Osirium said its pretax 
loss for the half to the end of April was GBP512,769, widened from a GBP373,033 loss a year prior. Revenue fell to 
GBP162,000 from GBP175,000, hit by a sharp decline in professional services sales which offset higher revenue 
for software-as-a-service products. The company floated on AIM in April, raising GBP5.1 million, which it has used 
to hire new staff, increase marketing activity and invest more in research and development.
WH Ireland Group, down 9.1%. The wealth manager and corporate broker said it swung to a loss in the first half of 
its financial year, as revenue sank. The company said it made a pretax loss of GBP1.8 million in the half year to the 
end of May, compared to a GBP593,000 profit a year earlier. Revenue shrivelled to GBP12.0 million from GBP15.9 
million. This was caused by a decline in transactional income, which WH Ireland Chairman Tim Steel said was due 
to a "moribund" UK stock market, pressured by fears over Chinese economic growth, commodity price deflation 
and, latterly, the UK's EU referendum.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum cut its price target and profit forecasts for Ryanair following the UK Leave vote 
in the referendum on European Union membership, but said the Irish budget airline's business is "well diversified", 
keeping a Buy stance on the stock.  
"Brexit turbulence creates a more challenging environment for Ryanair," said Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo. 
"However, its exposure to the UK is manageable, it has the ability to grow elsewhere in Europe, and past downturns 
have accelerated market share gains."
The broker cut its price target on Ryanair shares to EUR13.50 from EUR15.75. The stock is 9.2% above the low of 
EUR10.73 it touched after the vote in late June, its lowest level since May 2015. 
Tuesday morning, Ryanair shares were down 0.3% at EUR11.66. 
Khoo said the uncertainty caused by Brexit is likely to damp business and consumer confidence in the short term, 
with increased downside risks to air travel demand. 
"However, Ryanair should still benefit from offsetting effects, such as trading down to short haul destinations from 
long haul ones, and switching to cheaper airlines," said the analyst. Khoo noted that, though the UK is Ryanair's 
largest market, the company is "well diversified". 
Liberum cut its financial year 2017 profit after tax forecast to EUR1.32 billion from EUR1.45 billion. In the year to 
March 2016, Ryanair reported a profit after tax of EUR1.24 billion. 
Ryanair is scheduled to release its first-quarter results on July 25.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airline easyJet PLC on Wednesday said both the number of passengers carried 
and its load factor rose in June year-on-year.
Passenger numbers increased by 5.8% in June to 6.9 million from 6.6 million in the same month the year before, 
while load factor grew by 1.4 percentage points to 94.1% from 92.7%.
On a rolling 12-month basis, passenger numbers rose by 7.1% to 71.9 million from 67.1 million, and load factor was 
up 0.3 percentage point to 91.5% from 91.2%.
easyJet said there were 852 cancellations in June compared with 487 in June 2015.
On Tuesday, rival low-cost airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC also reported growth in 
passenger numbers and load factor in June.
Irish carrier Ryanair said it carried 10.6 million customers, which is an 11% increase on the 9.5 million carried a 
year earlier. Load factor rose by 1 percentage point to 94% from 93%.
Central and Eastern European-focused carrier Wizz Air said passenger numbers increased by 16% to 2.0 million 
from 1.7 million the year before. Load factor rose by 0.8 percentage point to 91.7% from 91.0%.
Later Tuesday, International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, which owns British Airways, Ireland's Aer Lingus, and 
Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling, too posted growth in group traffic and load factor.
IAG's group traffic, measured by revenue passenger kilometres, rose by 14% in June on a year before, while load 
factor improved to 84.0% from 83.7%.

LONDON (Alliance News) -  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA on Tuesday said group traffic, capacity 
and premium traffic all rose in June.
IAG, which owns British Airways, Ireland's Aer Lingus, and Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling, said its group traffic 
measured by revenue passenger kilometres rose 14% in June on a year before. Group capacity measured in 
available seat kilometres rose 13%. Load factor improved as a result to 84.0% from 83.7%.
On a pro-forma basis, taking into account the acquisition last year of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, traffic rose 3.5%, 
whilst capacity rose 3.3%. Group premium traffic rose 0.1% in May on a year before, also on a pro-forma basis.
On Friday, UBS said IAG's flexibility could help it withstand some of the medium-term pressure following the result 
of the UK referendum on European Union membership.
Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Tuesday also both reported annual growth in 
passenger numbers and load factor in June. Easyjet reports its June traffic statistics on Wednesday. 
Shares in IAG were up 1.2% at 379.40 pence on Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Persimmon posted strong results in the first half of its financial year, but said it was too soon to tell how the result of 
the UK vote to end European Union membership will affect the UK new homes market. The housebuilder said both 
its average sales price and number of legal completions rose in the six months ended June 30, with legal 
completion volumes up 6.0% to 7,238 from 6,855 for the same period a year earlier, whilst average sales price rose 
6.0% to GBP205,500 from GBP194,378. As a result, revenue rose by 12% to GBP1.489 billion from GBP1.33 
billion.
----------
The chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland Group has said the government's planned sale of its controlling 
stake in the company has been delayed for at least two years due to Britain's vote to leave the European Union, the 
Financial Times reported. Ross McEwan said the Brexit decision had been a "real hit to the bank", speaking to LBC 
Radio. "This will be a setback; let's be honest. I think at least a couple of years it will be pushed back." McEwan 
was referring to the UK government's target of raising GBP29.0 billion from selling the majority of its 73% stake in 
RBS over the next five years.
----------
Life insurer and investment manager Standard Life was forced to stop retail investors from selling out of one of its 
property funds after the Brexit vote sparked significant cash outflows, the FT reported. The company's GBP2.9 
billion commercial property fund will have to sell properties to raise cash before any money can be redeemed after 
the move, the FT said. The fund is the third-largest open-ended property fund for retail investors.

Construction and infrastructure group Balfour Beatty said it has been awarded a GBP170.0 million contract to 
upgrade the baggage screening and handling systems for Heathrow Airport. The project was awarded through the 
Heathrow Airport Ltd "delivery integrator framework" to which Balfour Beatty was appointed in 2014, and will involve 
upgrading and installing baggage screening and handling systems at Heathrow's eastern baggage facility.
----------
Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air Holdings both reported annual growth in passenger numbers and 
load factor in June. Irish carrier Ryanair said it carried 10.6 million customers in June, which is an 11% increase on 
the 9.5 million carried in the same month a year earlier. Load factor rose by 1 percentage point to 94% from 93%. 
Central and Eastern European-focused carrier Wizz Air said passenger numbers increased by 16% in June to 2.0 
million from 1.7 million in the same month the year before. Load factor rose by 0.8 percentage point to 91.7% from 
91.0%.
----------
Marshalls said its underlying indicators remain positive, notwithstanding the uncertainty caused by the result of the 
UK referendum on EU membership, after revenue for the first half came in ahead of the same period a year earlier. 
The concrete paving manufacturer said its revenue for the six months ended June 30 was GBP202.0 million, up 
2.0% from the GBP199.0 million reported for the same period a year earlier, which reflects a stronger sales 
performance in May and June compared with the first four months of the year. UK revenue in May and June was up 
5.0% compared with 2015 comparatives, Marshalls said.
----------
St Modwen Properties said pretax profit in the first half fell year-on-year despite revenue rising and the company 
said will take a cautious stance on development following the Brexit vote. "Following the referendum held on June 
23, we are now operating in a period of uncertainty in relation to many factors that impact the property market. 
Whilst it is too early to accurately predict how the UK property market will respond, until we have more clarity we 
believe it is appropriate to take a more cautious approach to the delivery of our development strategy," said Chief 
Executive Bill Oliver.
----------
MARKETS
----------
UK share prices were flat to lower at midday, with the mid-cap FTSE 250 continuing to perform worse than its large-
cap counterpart. Retailing stocks were suffering from broker downgrades. The pound was sharply lower against the 
dollar, while Brent oil was under USD50 a barrel. Wall Street was pointed to a lower open after Monday's 
Independence Day holiday, with major indices called to open down 0.5% to 0.6%.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The Bank of England announced measures to help boost lending in the UK by up to GBP150 billion as it warned 
about a "challenging" outlook for financial stability after the Brexit vote. The central bank slashed funding rules for 
banks as part of measures to shore up the UK economy and financial system in the wake of the EU referendum and 
said it "stands ready to take any further actions" if needed. The bank unveiled the measure in its twice-yearly 
Financial Stability Report, which cautioned over the impact of the vote. The bank will reduce the capital required to

be held on banks' balance sheets by GBP5.7 billion, which it said will help bolster their ability to lend to households 
and businesses by up to GBP150 billion. Interest rates are now expected to fall to zero by the end of the year from 
their already historic low of 0.5%. Carney also signalled the possibility of the bank reviving its quantitative easing 
programme.
----------
The UK service sector activity growth weakened to match the 38-month low registered in April, survey results from 
Markit showed. The Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply services Purchasing Managers' Index 
dropped to 52.3 in June from 53.5 in May. The score was below the expected level of 52.8. A reading above 50.0 
signals growth in the sector. 
----------
China's private sector logged a weaker expansion in June despite acceleration in the service sector activity, the 
results of a survey by Markit Economics revealed. The Caixin composite output index dropped to 50.3 in June from 
50.5 in May. This was the lowest reading in four months but the score above 50 indicates growth.
----------
Pessimism among British businesses nearly doubled after the June 23rd referendum that resulted in a surprise 
decision to leave the EU, reports said, citing results of a survey by the Centre for Economics and Business 
Research and YouGov. The CEBR/YouGov survey showed that 49% of businesses who responded to the survey 
felt pessimistic about the UK economy after "Brexit" versus 25% in the week before the referendum. The survey 
also showed that businesses have reined in capital spending plans and their expectations for exports and domestic 
sales growth. The results signal a sharp slowdown in the economy in the months ahead.
----------
Conservative MPs are to cast their votes in the first ballot in the Tory leadership race after Boris Johnson threw his 
weight behind fellow Leave campaigner Andrea Leadsom. The former London mayor - who saw his own leadership 
hopes dashed after a devastating personal attack by Michael Gove - said she had "the zap, the drive and the 
determination" to lead the country. Ahead of the first ballot, a poll by the ConservativeHome website of 1,214 party 
members gave Leadsom a narrow lead with 38%, one point ahead of Home Secretary Theresa May - widely seen 
as the frontrunner - on 37%.
----------
Labour deputy leader Tom Watson is to hold emergency talks with trade union leaders in a last ditch attempt to end 
the impasse over Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the UK opposition party. At a one-to-one meeting at Westminster 
on Monday, Watson told Corbyn he could not carry on as party leader without the backing of the party's MPs, who 
last week voted overwhelmingly in favour of a vote of no confidence in him. In the wake of the failure of this latest 
attempt to break the deadlock, Labour sources said that union leaders had "reached out" to Watson to see if they 
could find a negotiated settlement. "It is the last throw of the dice," the deputy leader told MPs.
----------
Business leaders have stepped up pressure on the government to end the uncertainty facing EU nationals working 
in the UK following the referendum result. In an open letter, five business groups also called for planned 
infrastructure projects such as airport expansion, house building, rail and energy schemes to be given the go-
ahead.
----------
Ireland's service sector activity expanded strongly at the end of the second quarter, survey figures from Markit 
Economics showed. The services Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 61.2 in June from 61.7 in the previous 
month.
----------
The euro area private sector growth remained unchanged in June, final data from Markit Economics showed. The 
composite output index came in at 53.1 in June, the same as in May, but above the flash score of 52.8. A score 
above 50 indicates expansion. In the second quarter, the headline index slid to 53.1 from 53.2 in the previous 
quarter, and it was the lowest since the final quarter of 2014. Meanwhile, the services Purchasing Managers' Index 
fell to 52.8 in June from 53.3 in the prior month. According to the flash estimate, the reading dropped to 52.4. 
National PMI data indicated solid expansions in Germany, Italy, Spain and Ireland. On the other hand, French 
companies reported contraction in output and new orders.
----------

Japan's service sector activity deteriorated in June, led by the fastest decline in new orders in nearly five years, 
results of a survey by Markit Economics showed. The services purchasing managers' index, or PMI, fell to 49.4 in 
June from 50.4 in May.
----------
Australia retained its record low interest rate for the second straight month as policymakers await inflation data due 
later this month. The board of the Reserve Bank of Australia governed by Glenn Stevens maintained the cash rate 
at 1.75%. The outcome of the meeting came in line with expectations.
----------
A suicide bomber struck a police station in Indonesia, killing himself and injuring an officer, police said. The 
motorcyclist detonated his explosives when he was approached by the officer at the Surakarta city police 
department in Central Java, national police said.
----------
A suicide bomber killed four security officers and injured five others near one of Islam's holiest sites in the Saudi city 
of Medina, according to reports. The bomber detonated his explosives after being stopped outside the Prophet's 
Mosque, the reports said. The mosque is the burial place of the Prophet Muhammad and Medina the second-holiest 
city in Islam after Mecca. Suicide blasts also struck two other Saudi cities on Monday. The strikes come as the 
Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends.
----------
US President Barack Obama and his former secretary of state Hillary Clinton are to fly together Tuesday from the 
White House to a rally for the presumptive presidential nominee of the left-leaning Democratic Party. Clinton served 
as Secretary of State from 2009-13, after losing the 2008 Democratic nomination to Obama in a bruising intra-party 
battle. Obama formally endorsed Clinton only on June 9, after she had secured a narrow but clear victory over 
Senator Bernie Sanders. The White House announced late Monday that Clinton and Obama would travel together 
from Washington to Charlotte, North Carolina.

LONDON (Alliance News) - SVM UK Emerging Fund PLC on Monday reported growth in net asset value total return 
in its last financial year, and beat its benchmark, but said its NAV has been reduced post year-end following the 
result of the EU referendum.
The fund said its NAV total return grew by 8.1% in the year ended March 31, stronger than the 2.0% growth 
reported the year before, and beating its benchmark the IMA UK All Companies Sector Average Index which 
declined by 2.5%.
SVM said the most significant contributions came from gaming company Paddy Power Betfair PLC after the newly-
merged company was formed, airline holding company Dart Group PLC, clothing retailer SuperGroup PLC and low-
cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC. 
SVM noted, however, that its NAV has been reduced since the year end due to stock market volatility following the 
EU referendum.
"While the mixed economic background has an impact, there is good potential for organic growth in many portfolio 
companies.  They would benefit from further economic recovery in the UK and
Europe," Chairman Peter Dicks said in a statement.
"The company emphasises exposure to the UK, and businesses with operations in the US and Europe. Returns on 
cash deposits and bonds will remain very low, and so equities that offer growth and attractive dividend yields are 
being sought by investors," he added.
Shares in SVM were untraded on Monday, last quoted at 60.00 pence.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets endured another session of heavy losses Monday, following the 
unexpected result of the UK referendum at the end of the prior week. The uncertainty that the British vote to exit the 
EU has generated has left investors on edge. Financial stocks were again among the weakest performers at the 
start of the new trading week. British homebuilders and travel stocks were also under heavy pressure.
The UK economy is strong enough to face the future but needs to adjust to the new situation, Chancellor of the 
Exchequer George Osborne said Monday in a bid to calm financial markets that have been roiled by the country's 
decision to leave the EU in the June 23rd referendum.
"Britain is ready to confront what the future holds for us from a position of strength," Osborne said in his first public 
remarks since Britons voted to leave the EU.
Osborne had campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU, just like Prime Minister David Cameron, who announced 
his resignation on Friday after the referendum results.
"I said we had to fix the roof so that we were prepared for whatever the future held. Thank goodness we did," 
Osborne said. "Our economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces."
That said, the "Brexit" will have an impact on the economy and public finances - and there will need to be action to 
address that, he said.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks decreased 2.83%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, lost 2.66%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 3.02% and the CAC 40 of France fell 2.97%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 
2.55% and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 1.97%.
In Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank dropped 6.17% and Commerzbank surrendered 5.24%.
European Markets Suffered Further Losses In Brexit Aftermath
Volkswagen declined 7.13% and BMW fell 4.35%. Daimler weakened by 3.07% and Continental lost 8.08%.
In Paris, Sanofi rose 1.51% after the drug maker reached definitive agreements with Boehringer Ingelheim to swap 
Sanofi's animal health business "Merial" and Boehringer Ingelheim's consumer healthcare business.
Peugeot sank 9.01% and Renault decreased 6.04%. Car parts maker Valeo also finished lower by 7.46%.
Societe Generale dropped 8.39% and Credit Agricole forfeited 5.97%. BNP Paribas also closed down by 6.32%.
In London, Foxtons Group sank 22.59% and easyJet plunged 22.32% after both warned that Britain's referendum 
decision to quit the EU will hit their financial performance this year.
Travel group TUI dropped 10.32% on saying the fall in the pound would hit profits. Budget airline Ryanair tumbled 
13.90% and British Airways-owner International Airlines Group fell 15.92%.
British homebuilders continued to suffer heavy losses. Barratt Development plunged 19.42% and Taylor Wimpey 
sank 14.92%. Persimmon dropped 13.82% and Berkeley Group surrendered 9.72%.
Barclays sank 17.35% and Royal Bank of Scotland weakened by 15.10%. Lloyds Banking Group declined 10.26% 
and Standard Chartered lost 6.27%. HSBC also finished lower by 2.22%.
Volvo AB plunged 14.85% in Stockholm after making an additional provision of 250 million euros in connection with 
the ongoing EU Competition Investigation.
Eurozone money supply growth accelerated in May and the annual increase in loans to households improved, the 
European Central Bank said Monday. The broad monetary aggregate M3 increased by faster-than-expected 4.9% 
on a yearly basis, following a 4.6% increase seen in April. It was expected to rise to 4.8%.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - European stocks extended Friday's steep losses as banks fell again on concerns about 
their long-term profits and financial health. Investor sentiment remains cautious despite central banks around the 
world moving to reassure markets.
The UK economy is strong and its banks and financial system are healthy, UK Chancellor George Osborne told a 
press conference on Monday, although he admitted that it will not be plain sailing in the days ahead.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 2.8% in midday trading after plunging as much as 7% in the 
previous session.
The German DAX, France's CAC 40 index and the UK's FTSE 100 were down between 1.5% and 1.8%.
Spain's IBEX drifted into negative territory after climbing about 2% in early trade, as caretaker Prime Minister 
Mariano Rajoy emerged as the clear winner in Spain's general election.
Barclays' shares were down 13% in London and the Royal Bank of Scotland traded down about 15%. Shares in 
both were temporarily suspended earlier in the session.
Regional banks Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale Group, Credit 
Suisse, UniCredit and Intesa lost 4-8%. Foxtons Group slumped 23% and easyJet plummeted 18% after both 
warned that Britain's referendum decision to quit the EU will hit their financial performance this year.
Travel group TUI dropped 3% on saying the fall in the pound would hit profits. Budget airline Ryanair and British 
Airways-owner International Airlines Group both fell around 8% each.
British property developers also fell sharply, with Berkeley Group Holdings, Barratt Developments and Taylor 
Wimpey falling 11-15%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Investec said the decision by the UK to leave the European Union is  "unambiguously 
negative for the Irish economy" and believes earnings are most at risk for Irish companies such as Ryanair 
Holdings, C&C Group and Origin Enterprises.
Meanwhile, the general risk-off environment that will prevail invariably harms banking and cyclical stocks in Ireland. 
A sixth of total Irish exports, and more than 40% of exports from Irish domestic firm, go to the UK, Ireland's nearest 
neighbour.
Irish safe havens in this storm include Glanbia, Kerry Group and CRH, the bank said.
Investec analysts Gerard Moore and Philip O'Sullivan said, "from a foreign exchange translation perspective, the 
major losers are likely to be Origin, C&C Group and Ryanair which all have significant exposure to the UK and 
report in euro."
Conversely, companies such as FTSE 100 distribution company DCC and FTSE 250 builders' merchant Grafton 
Group, both of which report in sterling but have significant exposure outside the UK, will get a technical boost to 
earnings. 
However, Moore and O'Sullivan said that an extended period of uncertainty in the UK could lead to a slowdown in 
GDP with a potential negative impact on consumer spending and investment decisions, wiping away some of that 
currency gain for Grafton.  
"Here, we would see vulnerable companies as Ryanair, Kingspan, Grafton, Dalata [Hotel Group] and Bank of 
Ireland which all have [more than a] 20% exposure to such sensitive parts of the economy," the Investec pair noted.
The analysts also examined the consequences the Brexit will have for the Irish economy, saying the development is 
"unambiguously negative".
"A crucial issue for negotiation will be what sort of trade agreement is established between the UK
IN THE KNOW: Glanbia, Kerry And CRH Are Irish Safe Havens From Brexit
and Ireland, with most parties looking for some sort of common trade and travel zone. Here companies like ICG and 
Dalata are most exposed," Moore and O'Sullivan said, referring to ferry company Irish Continental Group.
They added that there could be safe-haven stocks within the Irish food and beverage sector such as Glanbia and 
Kerry Group due to a relatively low level of exposure to the UK and the low risk nature of the foods sector.
In addition, FTSE 100 building materials company CRH generates 13% of earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation from the UK and 60% from North America, which the analysts see as a positive. 
"We also see the REITs as relatively defensive given the fact that they have no exposure to the UK and 
fundamentals in the Irish property market remain strong. Indeed there could be a pick-up in inward investment as 
companies seek to relocate operations to Ireland," the analysts added.
Ryanair was down 8.6%, C&C down 1.7%, and Origin Enterprises down 0.2%. Kingspan was down 20%, Grafton 
down 23%, ICG down 8.6%, Dalata down 9.7%, and Bank of Ireland down 24%.
Less affected, Glanbia was off 3.3%, Kerry 1.1% and CRH 0.4%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Central and Eastern Europe-focused carrier Wizz Air Holdings looks a high-margin and 
high-growth business but this does not come without risks, Davy warned, particularly in terms of its yield outlook.
Davy analyst Ross Harvey said Wizz Air's network is focused on connecting Central and Eastern Europe with 
Western Europe, a market that is expected to double in size over the next decade. In addition, he said there looks 
to be significant upside to current low-cost carrier penetration in the market, currently at around 42% but which 
could rise to around 60% in the medium term.
Harvey said Wizz Air's ex-fuel cost per available seat kilometre was around 2.22 euro cents in its financial year to 
the end of March 2016. That is around 30% to 40% lower than rivals easyJet, Norwegian or Vueling, though around 
20% higher than Ryanair Holdings.
The Davy analyst said there is potential for Wizz Air's costs to further improve - by around 1.0% per annum out to 
its 2020 financial year - through scale benefits, disciplined cost management and by 'up-gauging', by which airlines 
add extra seats to existing jets and replace smaller planes with larger ones.
Harvey added Wizz Air is exploiting its low cost base with plans to expand capacity in excess of 50% over the next 
three years. Davy anticipates Wizz Air fleet, currently of 67 aircraft, will increase by more than 50% by 2020, 
delivering capacity growth of around 16% a year.
This capacity growth would be roughly double that planned by Ryanair and easyJet over the next three years, 
Harvey noted, albeit from a much lower base.
The key area of concern for Wizz Air, however, is yield, as this growth dynamic will inevitably lead to more 
competition between low-cost carriers, Harvey said.
From this winter, the Davy analyst said Wizz Air will overlap with Ryanair on around 12% of its airport-pair network, 
more than double the 5.0% exposure it had in its 2014 financial year.
IN THE KNOW: Wizz Air Growth Attractive But Faces Yield Risks - Davy
This increased competition is recognised in Davy's forecasts by the assumption of a 1.9% decline in revenue per 
available seat kilometre through to 2020, driven by ticket price declines and only partially offset by higher ancillary 
revenue.
Wizz Air currently trades at 11.7x 2017 price-earnings estimates, Davy said, leaving it trading in line with Ryanair 
and at a 20% premium to easyJet.
Though Wizz Air has higher expected growth in its outlook, it also has greater market and execution risk, and 
Harvey said he would prefer to see a more attractive discount on the shares before turning more positive on the 
stock.
On that assertion, Davy initiated Wizz Air with a Neutral rating and 2,050 pence price target.
Wizz Air shares were down 0.2% to 1,931.00p Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The introduction of Ryanair's new accommodation service may present hostel booking 
platform Hostelworld with an opportunity, according to Numis, although the broker noted that Hostelworld may not 
be "excited" about the idea of partnering with the airline.
Last Thursday, budget airline Ryanair announced the launch in October of Ryanair Rooms - a low-price 
accommodation booking offering. Ryanair Rooms will offer a choice of hotel, hostel, B&B, holiday villa and 
homestay options, through a partnership between Ryanair and third-party accommodation providers. 
In a note on Monday, Numis said it understands the partnership invitation has been extended to Hostelworld. 
However, it noted that "market concern" over Ryanair Rooms may have contributed to the decline in Hostelworld's 
share price on Friday.
The broker highlighted that Hostelworld won't necessarily view Ryanair Rooms as a significant new competitive 
threat, but said that Hostelworld may not be "excited" about the idea of partnering with Ryanair due to partnerships 
with the airline "not always" being profitable for third parties. It did say though that a partnership could be an 
"opportunity" for Hostelworld.
Numis noted that Ryanair's current accommodation partnership with Booking.com will end in September, having 
begun in 2009 and providing Ryanair with its longest relationship with a third-party accommodation provider. The 
broker highlighted that partners "came and went in rapid succession" in the mid-200s, including a bitter contract 
termination with Expedia over contract terms.
In terms of trading, Numis added that disrupted travel patterns have made trading more difficult for Hostelworld in 
recent months, but noted that management is "making good progress" with the parts of the business it can control. 
"In our view, Hostelworld continues to have attractive growth opportunities and the shares are cheap," Numis 
analyst Wyn Ellis said.
Numis upgraded Hostelworld to Buy from Add. It has a 300 pence target price on the stock.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday said it is launching 'Ryanair Rooms', a low-price 
accommodation booking offer, from October 1, though the budget airline won't itself become a hotelier.
Ryanair Rooms will offer a choice of hotel, hostel, B&B, holiday villa and homestay options, and Ryanair is inviting 
accommodation providers to partner with the airline on the offering.
Ryanair said all accommodation will be at the "lowest possible prices" for its customers.
This follows on from the launch of Ryanair Car Hire last August, in partnership with CarTrawler.
"More and more customers are looking to Ryanair for products other than flights, and we see this as a natural 
progression towards Ryanair.com becoming the Amazon of air travel. It also echoes the change in demand from 
customers for different types of accommodation, which in turn will be reflected by the varied range "Ryanair Rooms" 
will offer - from five-star hotel rooms to independent homestay," Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said in a 
statement.
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 1.8% at EUR13.50 on Thursday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Investec expects UK travel & leisure companies, pub operators, food delivery providers 
and bookies to benefit from the UEFA European Championship 2016 football tournament starting in France on 
Friday.
Guy Ellison, head of UK equities at Investec Wealth & Investment said that, from an economic point of view, the 
Euros, coupled with the forecast of a potential heatwave over the coming weeks, could bring "a very good month" 
for pub companies as well food delivery providers. 
The analyst said bookmakers also should see "a significant betting influx" from the tournament, "and, barring an 
England victory, some strong profit figures". 
Among UK travel stocks are FTSE 100-listed air carriers easyJet and British Airways-owner International 
Consolidated Airlines Group, as well as FTSE 250-listed Wizz Air Holdings and main market listed Ryanair 
Holdings. Meanwhile, Intercontinental Hotels could take benefit from the five hotels it owns in France. 
Food delivery companies such as Domino's Pizza Group and pub operators such Marston's, as well as bookies 
Paddy Power Betfair and William Hill, are also expected to capitalise on the tournament. 
Investec's Ellison said general retailers might also see a "modest boost" from sales of products such as new 
televisions, "with retailers of electronics promoting hard in the run up to the competition". 
Home Retail Group said Thursday that total sales at digital retail chain Argos grew by 2.6% year-on-year in the 13 
weeks ended May 28 to GBP868 million, with like-for-like sales up by 0.1%. Gross margin at Argos, however, 
declined by 100 basis points, partly due to a negative sales mix impact from the improved performance of margin-
dilutive electrical products.
The Investec analyst highlighted that the Euro 2016-inspired increase in consumer spending could grind to a halt in 
the event of a Leave vote in the EU referendum scheduled for June 23.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UBS said Wizz Air Holdings should continue to grow its market share and the Central 
and Eastern European-focused budget airline can compete with its peer Ryanair Holdings in the years to come.
The Swiss bank reiterated its Buy rating on the stock and kept its price target at 2,350 pence. The stock was up 
0.8% at 1,932.00p.
Jarrod Castle, an analyst at UBS, said Wizz Air should continue to grow its market share in during 2017 after it saw 
a better than expected performance in 2016.
Wizz Air last month reported growth in profit in its recently-ended financial year as revenue was boosted by growth 
in passenger numbers and load factor, and it said it expects a "significant" rise in profit for the current financial year. 
The company said its pretax profit in the year ended March 31 grew to EUR201.4 million from EUR191.7 million the 
year before, as revenue rose to EUR1.43 billion from EUR1.23 billion.
Castle attributed the favourable results to a profitable last quarter, aided by continued (excluding fuel) cost control, 
a fuel tailwind and yields which despite being negative did not offset the benefits. The analyst said Wizz Air 
continued to grow its market share and remains the leader in the Central and Eastern Europe region.
UBS also regards Wizz Air and Irish airline Ryanair Holdings, as the two ultra low cost carriers in Europe and that 
the backdrop for such airlines and drivers for low cost remain favourable.
Castle said penetration rates remain low for budget airlines in a number of markets, including Wizz's core markets 
in Central and Eastern Europe. In addition, wider economic growth has shown a favourable relationship with air 
travel, he added. 
"Wizz Air also has a fleet plan to deliver continued growth [and] although traditional carriers are trying to adjust their 
cost bases the ex-fuel cost advantage of the ultra-low cost carriers remains considerable," Castle noted.
IN THE KNOW: Wizz Air Can Grow Market Share And Compete With Ryanair
The analyst argued there is more room for the low cost carrier industry, and particularly Wizz Air, to grow saying 
these airlines are the driver of short haul capacity growth in the near and medium term. "These airlines have the 
cost base and fleet deals in place to continue to grow and take market share from certain of the traditional flag 
carriers."
Castle also said Wizz Air is more than capable of competing with its Irish counterpart despite Ryanair being a 
strong competitor in a number of central and eastern European markets. The analyst highlighted the fact that Wizz 
has grown profitably and is the largest airline in the region, with a 43% market share. 
Furthermore, Wizz is only second to Ryanair in terms of European airline cost of production, according to the 
analyst.
"We think the LCC [low cost carrier] market should continue to take market share from the broader Flag carrier 
operators, and Wizz's fleet deal will allow it to sustain growth over the current decade," Castle added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airlines Wizz Air Holdings PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday both

to 90.1% from 89%.
Larger rival Ryanair, meanwhile, saw customer traffic grow by 12% in May to 10.6 million from 9.5 million the year 
before, as load factor increased by 2 percentage points to 92% from 94%.
Ryanair's Marketing Director Kenny Jacobs said its results were achieved despite ongoing disruptions caused by air 
traffic control strikes in France.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Barclays reduced its earnings estimates for Ryanair to reflect higher fuel cost guidance 
and the impact of the Brussels terror attacks on the airline's first quarter, but noted that the budget airline has begun 
the year with a traditionally "extremely cautious outlook".
On Monday, Ryanair said its profit, revenue and number of customers carried all grew in its recently completed 
financial year, though it expects softer pricing and only modest growth in net profit in the current year.
Profit after tax for the year to the end of March grew 43% to EUR1.24 billion from EUR867.0 million a year earlier, 
while revenue rose 16% to EUR6.54 billion from EUR5.65 billion, and the airline carried 106.4 million passengers, 
18% more than the year before.
But Ryanair expressed a degree of caution on the current financial year, saying it anticipates profit after tax to rise 
"modestly" in the year to the end of March 2017 to between EUR1.38 billion and EUR1.43 billion.
"Ryanair has kicked off financial 2017 with its traditional extremely cautious outlook. The guide for winter fares to 
fall 10% to 12% with no visibility seems more useful for media headlines and intimidating competitors than steering 
investors. Barring major geopolitics, we think there is easily 15% to 20% potential upside to guidance," Barclays 
said in a note published Friday.
The bank noted that the transformation of Ryanair's network and revenue momentum have driven load factor up by 
10 percentage points, which should "naturally shift" into underlying fare increases.
The key summer period also looks positive as other low-cost airlines have suggested solid peak summer demand 
and as Ryanair's forward bookings are up year-on-year, Barclays said, despite a strong prior comparative period. 
However, Barclays noted that while underlying consumer demand "appears solid", "we need to acknowledge that 
the frequency of terrorism events in Europe appears to be on the increase, which can heavily affect Ryanair's 
pricing," adding that air traffic control strikes across Europe also seem to be occurring more regularly. 
IN THE KNOW: Barclays Cuts Ryanair Forecast But Foresees Guidance Beat
As a result, Barclays lowered its earnings per share estimates for financial 2017 and 2018 by 7%, but still remained 
positive of the airline overall.
"Following a remarkable two years, Ryanair's margins, ROIC and cash generation are now amongst the best of any 
global airline. We believe there is more to come: driven by its strategic transformation, we see Ryanair delivering 
around 20% CAGR five-year EPS growth, funding all of its expansion out of operating cashflow, with enough 
surplus for EUR1 billion annual cash returns," Barclays said. 
Barclays maintained its Overweight rating on the stock but reduced its price target to EUR18.00 from EUR20.00.
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 0.7% at EUR13.88 on Friday afternoon.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Broker said Ryanair Holdings' full-year results were broadly in line with their estimates, 
while Liberum noted that the outlook for 2017 given by the budget airline was "typically cautious". 
The Irish group said Monday its profit, revenue and number of customers carried all grew in its recently completed 
financial year, though it expects softer pricing and only modest growth in net profit in the current year.
Ryanair said profit after tax for the year to the end of March grew 43% to EUR1.24 billion from EUR867.0 million a 
year earlier. Revenue rose 16% to EUR6.54 billion from EUR5.65 billion, and the airline carried 106.4 million 
passengers, 18% more than the year before.
Following the results, Ryanair shares closed up 1.5% at EUR13.57 on Monday.
"The results for the year to March were in line with consensus and our estimates. Compared with our forecasts, 
revenue was slightly light but costs marginally better than forecast," said Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo.
Ryanair said unit costs fell 6.0% over the course of the year, or 2.0% excluding cheaper fuel, and the group expects 
to continue cutting costs in the current financial year.
But Ryanair expressed a degree of caution on the current financial year. The group said it anticipates profit after tax 
to rise "modestly" in the year to the end of March 2017 to between EUR1.38 billion and EUR1.43 billion.
Liberum's Khoo said the outlook given by Ryanair air was "typically cautious". 
"Despite guidance being below consensus, we would not expect consensus estimates to fall, given management's 
record of cautious guidance," Khoo said. 
Ryanair said its guidance will be "heavily dependent" on summer bookings strength and on the yields for the winter 
months. It said summer bookings are on average 2% ahead of a year before, though at lower average fares. 
REPEAT: IN THE KNOW: Ryanair Guidance Is "Typically Cautious"
Liberum retained a Hold recommendation on Ryanair and a price target of EUR15.50.
Davy Research said the reported pretax profit of EUR1.24 billion was ahead of the broker's own forecast of 
EUR1.22 billion and consensus expectations of EUR1.25 billion. 
Meanwhile, Davy's financial 2017 profit after tax estimates are at the upper end of the guidance range given by the 
Ryanair, but the company's figures are below consensus forecasts. The broker forecasts a profit after tax of 
EUR1.43 billion, while consensus is at EUR1.47 billion.
"We view this forecast as robust given the uncertainties in the external environment, as Ryanair continues to 
demonstrate industry leadership," Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said. 
Following the results, Davy kept an Outperform stance on Ryanair.
Meanwhile, Cantor Fitzgerald's financial 2017 profit after tax forecast is EUR1.51 billion. 
"It is not unusual for consensus to be ahead of guidance at this point in the year. However, this implies no upgrades 
to numbers at this time," said Cantor analyst Robin Byde. 
Cantor retained a Hold recommendation on Ryanair shares and a price target of EUR15.50.

terror attacks in Europe which have hit the airline industry, particularly in the second half of Ryanair's financial year.

LONDON (Alliance News) - London share prices are set to open broadly flat Monday, with the focus on 
manufacturing and services Purchasing Manager's Index readings from Germany and France in the morning and 
the same from the US in the afternoon. 
In UK company news, budget airline Ryanair Holdings said its profit, revenue and number of customers carried all 
grew in its recently completed financial year, though it expects softer pricing and only modest growth in net profit in 
the current year.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index to open 3.5 points lower at 6,152.80. The index closed on Friday up 
1.7%, or 102.97 points, at 6,156.32, as traders appeared to take a more sanguine view on the possibility of a US 
interest rate hike in the near future and as fears of a Brexit cooled.

Germany at 0855 BST. The eurozone's readings are due at 0900 BST. In the afternoon, the eurozone consumer

Meanwhile, the US manufacturing PMI is due at 1445 BST.  
Already released Monday, Japan's manufacturing activity deteriorated at the steepest pace in over three years in 
May, the latest flash survey from Markit showed.
The Markit/Nikkei PMI, fell to 47.6 in May from 48.2 in April. The latest reading signalled the quickest contraction in 
manufacturing conditions since December 2012. A score below 50 indicates contraction, while any score above 50 
suggests expansion in the sector.
Meanwhile, Japan posted a merchandise trade surplus of JPY823.474 billion in April, the Ministry of Finance said. 
That topped forecasts for a surplus of JPY521.4 billion following the JPY754.2 billion surplus in March.

Meanwhile, Mitie Group said pretax profit more than doubled in its recent financial year thanks to lower one-off 
costs, as the FTSE 250 outsourcer launched a share buyback.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index to open 1.02 points higher at 6,157.30. The index closed on Friday up

Meanwhile, the US manufacturing PMI reading is due at 1445 BST.

Ryanair said profit after tax for the year to the end of March grew 43% to EUR1.24 billion from EUR867.0 million a

Meanwhile, Mitie's underlying profit only edged higher in the year to the end of March, and its order book for the 
new year is slightly weaker than a year prior. Mitie handles facilities management and advises clients on how to cut 
energy usage. 
It said its pretax profit more than doubled in the recent year to GBP96.8 million from GBP41.5 million the year 
earlier, mainly due lower one-off costs. Operating profit excluding exceptional items was marginally higher, up to 
GBP128.9 million from GBP128.6 million.
Revenue was slightly lower, down to GBP2.23 billion from GBP2.27 billion, which Mitie attributed to lower 
discretionary and project spend by its clients. The group expects revenue to grow in the current financial year 
thanks to a recent flow of facilities management contract wins. The facilities management business represents 84% 
of Mitie's revenue.
Mitie declared a final dividend of 6.7 pence per share, up from 6.5p, taking its total payout for the year up 3.4% to 
12.1p from 11.7p. In addition, Mitie announced a GBP20.0 million share buyback to return further cash to 
shareholders.
Life insurer and investment manager Legal & General Group said it has agreed to acquire a GBP3.0 billion annuity 
portfolio from Dutch peer Aegon NV. The deal has been structured as a reinsurance contract initially, L&G said, and 
covers around 27,000 in-payment policyholders who will remain customers of Aegon during the period.
They will continue to be served by Aegon until the deal receives regulatory and court approval, L&G said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - London shares were narrowly mixed early Monday, as a big week in company reporting 
started fairly quietly.
Broker rating changes were behind some of the biggest early stock movements. Royal Mail shares led the FTSE 
100, up 3.3%, after RBC Capital raised the stock to Sector Perform from Underperform.
Among mid-caps, Sports Direct International, down 3.9%, and ICAP, down 3.4%, were suffering from downgrades 
by Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, respectively.
The most prominent company to report Monday, Ryanair, was up 0.5%. The budget airline provided a strong set of 
annual figures but was cautious in its outlook for the year ahead.
Here is what you need to know at the London market open:

Quitting the European Union would plunge Britain into a year-long recession, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer 
George Osborne has warned. The country would suffer an "immediate and profound" economic shock following a 
vote to leave that would be made worse by the negotiations that followed, according to Treasury analysis released 
by the chancellor ahead of the EU referendum in one month today. It shows that economic growth would be at least 
3.6% lower following a Brexit win in the June 23 referendum but could plummet as much as 6%.
----------
Prime Minister David Cameron rejected claims by Vote Leave campaigners that Turkey could join the EU in the 
next five years and flood Britain with new migrants. Vote Leave will launch a poster campaign showing an open 
door in the style of an EU passport and the message: "Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU. Vote Leave, 
take back control." It claims Britain is powerless to stop Turkey joining the EU and enjoying freedom of movement 
for its citizens. But Cameron told broadcaster ITV that Turkey's accession was not "remotely on the cards" in the 
near future and that Britain has a veto over it joining the EU.
----------
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appointed loyalist Binali Yildirim as the country's new prime minister on 
Sunday, just hours after the former transport minister was confirmed leader of the ruling Justice and Development 
Party (AKP). Yildirim, a staunch conservative, was the AKP's sole nominee to replace Ahmet Davutoglu at the helm 
of the party and the cabinet following a special congress held in Ankara.
----------
British exporters logged a moderate growth in the first quarter, the latest Quarterly International Trade Outlook from 
the British Chambers of Commerce and DHL showed. The trade confidence index increased by 1.4% sequentially 
to 116.04 in the first quarter. However, it dropped 4.4% from the prior year. The balance of manufacturers reporting 
LONDON BRIEFING: Ryanair Provides Strong Results But Cautious Outlook
improved export sales and orders growth rose to +8% each. Meanwhile, the balance of services firms posting 
improved export sales over the past three months fell to +13% in the first quarter from +15% a quarter ago.
----------
The Greek parliament approved a new package of tax hikes and austerity measures that are demanded by the 
country's international creditors. The 153 members of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' coalition supported the 
measure late Sunday, while 145 members of opposition parties voted against the measure required for the cash-
strapped country to receive additional bailout loans from its creditors. The measure is designed to generate EUR1.8 
billion through a tax hike affecting restaurants, hotels, petrol and public transportation tickets.
----------
Japan's manufacturing activity deteriorated at the steepest pace in over three years in May, the latest flash survey 
from Markit Economics showed. The Markit/ Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, fell to 47.6 
in May from 48.2 in April. The latest reading signalled the quickest contraction in manufacturing conditions since 
December 2012. A score below 50 indicates contraction.
----------
An Egyptian submarine is backing up search efforts for the black boxes of an EgyptAir plane that crashed three 
days ago with 66 people on board, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi said on Sunday. He added that the submarine, 
operated by the Oil Ministry, was dispatched earlier on Sunday to the Mediterranean Sea where the Airbus A320 
had crashed. The two black boxes - cockpit voice and flight data recorders - can provide clues to what caused the 
airliner to plunge into the sea. Smoke was detected on the jet shortly before its crash on Thursday, the French air 
accident investigation agency BEA said on Saturday, confirming earlier news reports.
----------
Iraqi troops, backed by US-led airstrikes, have begun a major attack to drive the Islamic State terrorist militia from 
its stronghold in the western city of Fallujah, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said. "The clock of liberating 
Fallujah has struck," al-Abadi added in a televised address. Islamic State has been in control of Fallujah since early 
2014. The city, around 50 kilometres west of the capital Baghdad, was the first Iraqi city to fall to the al-Qaeda 
splinter group, before Islamic State seized more territory in the country in a lightning attack months later.
----------
The leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, was killed in a US drone strike on Saturday, Afghan 
officials confirmed. The Afghan spy agency, the National Directorate of Security (NDS), government Chief 
Executive Abdullah Abdullah and the presidential palace confirmed the death of Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar 
Mohammad Mansoor. US Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed the strike, noting the decision was made by 
President Barack Obama and that the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan had been notified of the airstrike.
----------
US President Barack Obama began a three-day visit to Vietnam on Monday outside the Presidential Palace in 
Hanoi. President Tran Dai Quang welcomed Obama in front of the century-old, French colonial-style building, which 
stands less than 300 metres from the mausoleum of former Communist revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh. Obama 
was to participate in three meetings with senior Vietnamese leadership. They were expected to discuss maritime 
security in the South China Sea, the possible lifting of a decades-old US arms embargo, and the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership trade deal that both countries signed in February.

Sky is being courted by at least five private equity groups seeking to get its backing for a bid for mobile operator O2, 
The Sunday Telegraph reported. Discussions on a possible GBP9.0 billion offer for O2, the UK mobile operator 
which has just seen its proposed merger with smaller rival Three UK blocked by European regulators, are at an 
early stage, the newspaper said. Sky's backing for a bid could be crucial as it is set to launch its own mobile service 
based on O2's network later in the year. 
----------
Sky also is understood to be among the companies looking at the possibility of picking up assets which may have to 
be sold to get regulatory passage for the merger of CK Hutchison and VimpelCom. CK Hutchison and VimpelCom 
have agreed a EUR20.0 billion merger of their 3 Italia and Wind mobile businesses in Italy. Hutchison is particularly 
sensitive to potential regulatory worries after its attempt to merger its Three UK business with O2 UK was blocked 
by the European Commission. The 3 Italia-Wind deal will create the largest mobile-only operator in Italy, putting the 
combined business narrowly ahead of Telecom Italia.
----------
BT Group is to start the search for a new chairman to replace Mike Rake at the end of the year, the Financial Times 
reported. Rake told the FT he will remain in his role "until at least September 2017", by which time he will have 
served a decade in the role.
----------
COMPANIES - FTSE 250
----------
Mitie Group said pretax profit more than doubled in its recent financial year thanks to lower one-off costs, as the 
FTSE 250 outsourcer launched a share buyback. However, Mitie's underlying profit only edged higher in the year to 
the end of March, and its order book for the new year is slightly weaker than a year prior. Mitie handles facilities 
management and advises clients on how to cut energy usage. It said its pretax profit more than doubled in the 
recent year to GBP96.8 million from GBP41.5 million the year earlier, mainly due lower one-off costs. Mitie declared 
a final dividend of 6.7 pence per share, up from 6.5p, taking its total payout for the year up 3.4% to 12.1p from 
11.7p. In addition, Mitie announced a GBP20.0 million share buyback to return cash to shareholders.

COMPANIES - LONDON MAIN MARKET AND AIM
----------
Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings said its profit, revenue and number of customers carried all grew in its recently 
completed financial year, though it expects softer pricing and only modest growth in net profit in the current year. 
Ryanair said profit after tax for the year to the end of March grew 43% to EUR1.24 billion from EUR867.0 million a 
year earlier. But Ryanair expressed a degree of caution on the current financial year. The group said it anticipates 
LONDON BRIEFING: Ryanair Provides Strong Results But Cautious Outlook
profit after tax to rise "modestly" in the year to the end of March 2017 to between EUR1.38 billion and EUR1.43 
billion.
----------
Banknote printer De La Rue said it has completed the sale of its Cash Processing Solutions subsidiary to CPS 
Topco, a company owned by private equity investor Privet Capital. De La Rue got GBP2.1 million on completion 
and could be paid up to GBP6.5 million in total based on Cash Processing Solutions hitting performance targets in 
the two years following the deal.
----------
GVC Holdings said it will licence its online sportsbook and gaming platform to Betfred, signing a ten-year 
agreement with the UK-based bookmaker. The London-listed e-gaming operator said the deal will lead to the "full 
migration" of Betfred's online businesses to the GVC platform on an exclusive basis after GVC was chosen to help 
drive the bookmaker's online growth.
----------
COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL
----------
German conglomerate Bayer said it has made an all-cash offer to acquire agricultural products giant Monsanto for 
USD122 per share or an aggregate value of USD62 billion. This offer, based on Bayer's proposal to Monsanto on 
May 10, represents a premium of 37% over Monsanto's closing share price on May 9.
----------
Quarrels have broken out behind the scenes of Anthem's USD48 billion proposed acquisition of Cigna Corp as the 
health insurers seek regulatory approval for their landmark deal, the Wall Street Journal reported. The report noted 
that the squabbles could delay or derail antitrust approvals, which are typically harder to obtain if both parties aren't 
in sync. While neither company has sought to terminate the merger, the people say, and it doesn't appear in danger 
of imminent collapse, Anthem and Cigna are bickering on several fronts.
----------
Aerospace and defense giant Boeing announced that the company and Vietnam's airline VietJet Aviation Joint 
Stock Co. have finalised an order for 100 737 MAX 200 airplanes, valued at approximately USD11.3 billion at 
current list prices. The order is the largest ever single commercial airplane purchase in Vietnam aviation. US 
President Barack Obama and Tran Dai Quang, president of Vietnam, witnessed the signing of the agreement.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks in London were mixed soon after the open, with broker rating changes driving 
the first moves in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250, while investors awaited the release of Purchasing Manager's Index 
readings from France and Germany in the morning. 
The FTSE 100 was down 0.4%, or 26.32 points, at 6,130.00. The FTSE 250 was up 0.2% at 16,953.00 and the AIM 
All-Share was up 0.4% at 730.55. 
Shares in Royal Mail were up 2.7% in the FTSE 100, after RBC Capital Markets upgraded the postal and logistics 
operator to Sector Perform from Underperform, and Cantor Fitzgerald increased its price target on the stock.
In the FTSE 250, Weir Group was among the best mid-cap performers after HSBC lifted the engineer to Buy from 
Hold. 
Mitie Group shares were up 0.2%. The company, which handles facilities management and advises clients on how 
to cut energy usage, said pretax profit more than doubled in its recent financial year thanks to lower one-off costs, 
as the FTSE 250 outsourcer launched a share buyback. 
It said its pretax profit more than doubled in the recent year to GBP96.8 million from GBP41.5 million the year 
earlier, mainly due lower one-off costs. Operating profit excluding exceptional items was marginally higher, up to 
GBP128.9 million from GBP128.6 million.
Revenue was slightly lower, down to GBP2.23 billion from GBP2.27 billion, which Mitie attributed to lower 
discretionary and project spend by its clients. The group expects revenue to grow in the current financial year 
thanks to a recent flow of facilities management contract wins. The facilities management business represents 84% 
of Mitie's revenue.

Mitie declared a final dividend of 6.7 pence per share, up from 6.5p, taking its total payout for the year up 3.4% to 
12.1p from 11.7p. In addition, Mitie announced a GBP20.0 million share buyback to return further cash to 
shareholders.
At the other end of the index, Sports Direct International was down 3.9% after Goldman Sachs cut the sports goods 
retailer to Neutral from Buy. Meanwhile, shares in ICAP were off 3.2% after Credit Suisse cut the interdealer broker 
to Neutral from Outperform. 
Spectris was also in the red, down 1.2% after JPMorgan Cazenove downgraded the company, which makes 
precision measurement instruments for industrial markets, to Neutral from Overweight. 
Elsewhere, Ryanair Holdings was up 0.7%. The budget airline said its profit, revenue and number of customers 
carried all grew in its recently completed financial year, though it expects softer pricing and only modest growth in 
net profit in the current year.
Ryanair said profit after tax for the year to the end of March grew 43% to EUR1.24 billion from EUR867.0 million a 
year earlier. Revenue rose 16% to EUR6.54 billion from EUR5.65 billion, and the airline carried 106.4 million 
passengers, 18% more than the year before.
The Irish airline said unit costs fell 6.0% over the course of the year, or 2.0% excluding cheaper fuel, and the group 
expects to continue cutting costs in the current financial year. But Ryanair expressed a degree of caution on the 
current financial year. The group said it anticipates profit after tax to rise "modestly" in the year to the end of March 
2017 to between EUR1.38 billion and EUR1.43 billion.
In the economic calendar Monday, Markit releases France's manufacturing and services PMI at 0850 BST. The 
eurozone's readings are due at 0900 BST. In the afternoon, the eurozone consumer confidence index is due at 
1500 BST.
"France manufacturing is expected to increase from 48.0 to 49.0, still in contraction territory, and services from 50.6 
to 50.8, while German manufacturing is expected to come in at 52.1, up from 51.8, with services coming in at 54.6 
from 54.5," said CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson.
In Paris, the CAC 40 was down 1.0% , while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was down 0.9%. 
Meanwhile, the US manufacturing PMI reading is due at 1445 BST.
Already released Monday, Japan's manufacturing activity deteriorated at the steepest pace in over three years in 
May, the latest flash survey from Markit showed. The Markit/Nikkei PMI, fell to 47.6 in May from 48.2 in April. 
Economists expected a score of 48.3. A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while any score above 50 suggests 
expansion in the sector.
Meanwhile, Japan posted a merchandise trade surplus of JPY823.474 billion in April, the Ministry of Finance said. 
That topped forecasts for a surplus of JPY521.4 billion following the JPY754.2 billion surplus in March.
The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo closed down 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.6%, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.3%.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets ended the first session of the new trading week with modest 
losses. The markets briefly turned positive this morning, but traded in negative territory for the majority of the 
session. The European markets logged their largest increase in a month at the end of the previous week, leading 
investors to take some profits.
Traders were disappointed by the unexpected decrease in Eurozone private sector data Monday. Commodity prices 
also struggled at the start of the week, as the US dollar strengthened.
The risks of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations to below 1% or close to zero in the euro area have increased 
and hence, the central bank acted forcefully, ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet said in an interview to a 
newspaper, published Monday.
"We have seen in some countries some signs of de-anchoring in wage formation, Praet said in an interview with the 
Portuguese daily Publico.
"But, this being said, we haven't concluded that inflation expectations are de-anchored."
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks decreased 0.99%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, lost 0.46%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 0.74% and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.66%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 
0.14% and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.51%.
In Frankfurt, pharmaceutical and chemicals giant Bayer fell 5.72% after making an all-cash offer to acquire US 
agrochemicals firm Monsanto Co. for USD62 billion.
Nordex lost 1.66% despite reporting a rise in Q1 profit and sales.
European Markets Weakened At The Start Of The New Week
Aixtron soared 16.21%. China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund LP said it would make a voluntary public 
takeover offer to buy the German semiconductor equipment maker for about 670 million euros ($752 million), 
including net cash.
Daimler dropped 1.57% and BMW weakened by 0.93%. Volkswagen also slipped 0.58%.
In Paris, Peugeot surrendered 1.06% and Renault lost 1.14%. In London, Inmarsat decreased 4.04% after Morgan 
Stanley downgraded its rating on the stock to "Equal weight" from "Overweight."
RBC Capital Markets upgraded its rating on shares of Royal Mail to "Sector perform" from "Underperform." The 
stock finished higher by 4.29%.
Ryanair climbed 2.09%. The company's full year earnings per share were 115.63 euros, higher than 62.46 euros 
last year.
Novartis increased 2.60% in Zurich after new guidelines on the treatment of heart failure strongly endorsed the use 
of its drug Entresto.
Richemont declined 3.48%, after it was downgraded by JPMorgan and Citigroup.
Insurer Aegon dropped 1.13% in Amsterdam after announcing the sale of GBP 3 billion annuity liabilities to Legal & 
General.
Fiat Chrysler fell 4.44% in Milan on a report that the carmaker has used illegal software to manipulate pollution 
emissions of its vehicles.
Eurozone consumer confidence improved for a second straight month and at a faster-than-expected pace in May to 
its highest level in four months, preliminary data from the European Commission showed Monday. The flash 
consumer confidence index climbed to -7 from -9.3 in April. Economists had forecast a score of 9 for the month.
Eurozone private sector growth weakened to the lowest level in more than a year in May as improvements in 
Germany and France were offset by softening of activity outside the big-two economies. The flash composite output 
index fell unexpectedly to a 16-month low of 52.9 from 53 in April, the results of the Purchasing Managers' Survey 
by Markit Economics revealed Monday. The index was forecast to rise to 53.2.
Germany's private sector activity expanded at a faster pace in May, flash survey results from Markit showed 
Monday. The composite output index rose to a 5-month high of 54.7 in May from 53.6 in April.
The French private sector growth improved to a 7-month high in May, flash survey data from Markit showed 
Monday. The composite output index rose to 51.1 in May, a 7-month high, from 50.2 in April.
British exporters logged a moderate growth in the first quarter, the latest Quarterly International Trade Outlook from 
the British Chambers of Commerce and DHL showed Sunday. The trade confidence index increased by 1.4% 
sequentially to 116.04 in the first quarter. However, it dropped 4.4% from the prior year.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The Leave campaign has been forced to deny charges it is indulging in conspiracy 
theories to explain away the multiple economic warnings issued on Brexit after Chancellor of the Exchequer George 
Osborne said it was not a conspiracy, but rather "consensus".
Osborne, speaking on Monday at the launch of a new training centre at London Stansted by Irish airline Ryanair 
Holdings, accused the Leave campaign of indulging in conspiracy theories and insisted there was an 
"overwhelming consensus" among economists and world leaders than leaving the EU would be bad for the UK.
The Chancellor, joined by former foes Ed Balls, the former Labour shadow chancellor, and Vince Cable, the Liberal 
Democrat business secretary under the coalition government, said an analysis prepared by the Treasury found that 
if the UK were forced to rely on World Trade Organisation rules following a Brexit, it could expect to lose around 
GBP200.0 billion in annual trade and overseas investment worth the same amount within 15 years.
Osborne said "credible" observers including the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund, along with 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development and US President Barack Obama, had all judged 
"Britain will be poorer and the British people will be poorer" if the country votes to leave.
Osborne accused the Leave camp of treating economic warnings as a "massive conspiracy".
"The next thing we know, the Leave camp will be accusing us of faking the moon landings, kidnapping Shergar and 
covering up the existence of the Loch Ness monster," he added.
He was speaking alongside Michael O'Leary, the outspoken chief executive of Ryanair, who said low-fare air travel 
in Europe was threatened by a Leave vote, throwing his company's support behind the Remain campaign.
Boris Johnson - the de facto leader of the Leave campaign, who has already faced criticism this week over 
comments he made comparing the European Union to the Third Reich - hit back at Osborne's charges. He argued 
there was "considerably better evidence" proving the Loch Ness monster exists than that the Treasury's Brexit 
forecasts will prove true.
BREXIT WATCH: Leave Accused Of Indulging In Conspiracy Theories
Johnson bemoaned the "colossal, glutinous tide of nonsense" issued by the Remain camp, a further heightening of 
the rhetoric in an increasingly bitter tussle.
Johnson made the comments as the Leave campaign pivoted its focus to concerns about how the UK can deal with 
the issue of tax avoidance whilst remaining part of the EU. Leave campaigners claim the National Health Service 
has been denied investment due to EU rulings which have helped multi-national businesses avoid paying "billions" 
in taxes in the UK.
Elsewhere, Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell called on the party's supporters to reject a "Tory Brexit", 
warning this would leave to a fresh wave of spending cuts by the Conservatives. McDonnell said Britain will face a 
"grim future" if it votes to leave the EU.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday called for the UK to remain part 
of the European Union as it announced the opening of a new training centre at London Stansted Airport.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary called for a strong Remain vote at the referendum on June 23 and said 
Britain's economy will be stronger as part of the EU.
Ryanair said remaining part of the EU will lead to more UK jobs and stronger economic growth and will encourage 
foreign direct investment in the country. The group added the single market has created the low-fare air travel 
customers can now access and said Prime Minister David Cameron has renegotiated significant reforms to the 
UK's EU membership.
The airline added foreign investment will be lost to other EU states if Britain voted to leave.
The comments were made as Ryanair opened a new European Training Centre at Stansted which will create 1,000 
new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers.
"It is this type of large scale foreign inward investment that is helping to drive the UK economy and job creation. It is 
exactly this type of investment that will be lost to other competitor EU members if the UK votes to leave the 
European Union," said O'Leary.
"The single market has enabled Ryanair to lead the low-fare air travel revolution in Europe, as we bring millions of 
British citizens to Europe each year, and welcome millions of European visitors to Britain, and we are calling on 
everyone to turn out in large numbers and vote 'Remain' on the 23rd June," he added.
Ryanair shares were up 0.9% to EUR12.92.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has accused the Leave camp in the EU 
referendum of indulging in conspiracy theories as he insisted there was an "overwhelming consensus" among 
economists and world leaders that Brexit would be bad for the UK.
Osborne was joined by former adversaries Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor, and Sir Vince Cable, former 
business secretary, at Stansted Airport, where he said that 450 jobs and almost GBP1 billion in investment 
announced by Ryanair would be "at risk if we left the EU".
The Chancellor was speaking as more than 300 business leaders signed a letter urging Britain to vote to leave the 
EU in the June 23 referendum, arguing that the UK's competitiveness is being undermined by its membership.
In a letter to The Daily Telegraph, they argue that businesses will be "free to grow faster, expand into new markets 
and create more jobs" if they are unconstrained by EU rules.
But Osborne said that new Treasury analysis showed that if the UK was forced to rely on World Trade Organisation 
rules following Brexit, it could expect to lose trade worth GBP200 billion a year and overseas investment worth 
GBP200 billion within 15 years.
Recent days had seen the emergence of a consensus shared by observers ranging from the Bank of England and 
the International Monetary Fund to the OECD and US president Barack Obama that "Britain will be poorer and 
British people will be poorer" if the UK votes to leave the EU, said the Chancellor.
And he accused the Leave camp of responding by treating the warnings as "a massive conspiracy".
"That's everyone from Mark Carney to Christine Lagarde to Barack Obama to the entire editorial team at ITV to the 
staff at the IMF and OECD, to hundreds of economists, to a majority of leaders of small, medium and large firms - 
they think they are all part of some global stitch-up to give misinformation to the British people," said Osborne.

been credible or serious."

LONDON (Alliance News) - easyJet PLC on Friday reported growth in passenger numbers in April year-on-year, but 
a decline in load factor.
The low-cost airline said it carried 6.1% more passengers in April 2016 than in April 2015, to 6.4 million from 6.0 
million. Its load factor, however, slipped by 0.4 percentage points to 90.4% from 90.8%.
On a rolling 12-month basis, passenger numbers rose by 7.4% to 71.1 million from 66.2 million, while load factor 
increased by 0.5 percentage points to 91.5% from 91.0%.
easyJet said it will release its first-half results for the six months ended March 31 on May 10.

passenger numbers and load factor in April.
Irish carrier Ryanair said total customers carried in the month increased 10% year-on-year to 9.9 million from 9.0 
million, as its load factor rose to 93% from 91%.
Eastern and Central European-focused Wizz Air, meanwhile, said passenger numbers grew 16% year-on-year in 
April to 1.8 million, up from 1.5 million, as its load factor was up to 86.5% from 86.2%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG is seeking a partnership, or a complete 
takeover, of Thomas Cook Group PLC-owned airline Condor, according to Reuters.
Talks with Thomas Cook have been taking place since at least January, Reuters said citing three people familiar 
with the matter, as Lufthansa plans to further expand its low-cost Eurowings business which it launched last year to 
rival the likes of Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC.
The talks could result in a marketing cooperation that would allow Lufthansa to buy capacity on Condor's 46 aircraft, 
sources told Reuters.
It could either acquire a minority stake in Condor or take over the airline completely, Reuters said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it will roll out lower airfares and improve its 
digital offering as part of the third year of its 'Always Getting Better' programme.
The low-cost airline said lower airfares will arise from oil savings it has made, which it will then pass on to its 
customers.
Other measures in the programme include new aircraft interiors featuring slimline seats, more leg room, coat hooks 
and LED lighting, and improvements to the mobile app.
"The continued drive to improve our customer experience has been reflected in the record passenger numbers and 
load factors we have had over the past two years, and we are pleased to launch year 3 of our "Always Getting 
Better" programme," Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said in a statement.
"While years 1 and 2 were about fixing the areas customers didn't like and improving the existing offering, year 3 
will be about digital acceleration and innovation, particularly through our Ryanair Labs digital developments," he 
added. 
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 0.5% at EUR13.11 on Tuesday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Concerns linger for budget carrier easyJet but Numis said it remains positive on the 
structural growth opportunities for the company and said the recent weakness in its share price has created an 
opportunity to buy.
Numis analyst Wyn Ellis said the airline sector continues to be overshadowed by recent terror attacks in Europe, 
which hit trading for easyJet in the first quarter to the end of December and trimmed revenue per seat by 3.7%.
Ellis cut pretax profit forecasts for easyJet for the year to September by 5.0%, primarily due to hit it will take from 
the bombings in Brussels.
Though Brussels only accounts for 1.0% of easyJet's capacity, the bombings are likely to impact short-haul city-to-
city travel and will inevitably weigh on customer confidence.
As ever, though the full year outcome remains dependent on the summer season, and Ellis said bookings look 
encouraging. Sterling has weakened, but vacation demand looks to be focused on destinations such as Spain, the 
Balearics, the Canary Islands and Portugal, all strong network points for easyJet.
Ellis added the capacity outlook for the summer looks "relatively benign". easyJet rival Ryanair Holdings has been 
aggressively expanding during the winter, but this should ameliorate in the summer, and Ellis expects total intra-
Europe capacity to grow by around 5% to 6%, with growth at the top end of this range on easyJet routes.
Ellis also expects easyJet's interim results, due May 10, to include the results of the company's cost review and 
funding and balance sheet metrics, which may open the door to a special dividend or increase in the pay-out ratio.
Given its recent share price decline, Numis upgraded easyJet to Buy from Add and kept its 1,850 pence price target 
intact.
easyJet shares were down 1.1% to 1,460.56p.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Shares in easyJet PLC took a hit on Wednesday after the low-cost airline said that 
while the number of passengers carried rose in March year-on-year, its load factor declined following cancellations 
due to strikes in France.
easyJet shares were trading down 2.2% at 1,488.00 pence on Wednesday morning, the worst performer in the 
FTSE 100 index.
easyJet said the number of passengers carried grew by 4.3% in March to 5.7 million from 5.5 million in the same 
month a year before. Load factor, however, declined by 1.3 percentage points to 91.3% from 92.6%.
easyJet said it had 611 flight cancellations in March, with the majority due to air traffic control strikes in France.
However, on Monday, rival budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC had reported growth in both customer traffic and 
load factor in March, despite also suffering from flight cancellations due to the strikes.
Ryanair said passenger traffic grew by more than a quarter to 8.5 million in March from 6.6 million in March 2015, 
as load factor rose to 94% from 90%, despite the cancellation of 500 Ryanair flights during the month.
Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said easyJet's monthly traffic statistics showed it is 
"struggling to keep pace" with Ryanair, saying the fall in load factor was "worrying". Van Dulken noted that Ryanair's 
monthly traffic statistics were "record-beating".
"While easyJet points to French strikes as a mitigating factor for March weakness, it is interesting to note that 
Ryanair did too and yet it still managed to post steady growth in both passenger numbers and loads," van Dulken 
said.
On a rolling 12-month basis, easyJet's passenger numbers rose by 7.2% to 70.8 million from 66.0 million, and load 
factor grew by 0.6 percentage points to 91.5% from 90.9%.
UPDATE: easyJet Underperforms Ryanair In March Amid French Strikes
On Tuesday, smaller budget airline Wizz Air Holdings PLC had reported a rise in both passengers and load factor in 
March.
The Central and Eastern European-focused low-cost airline said the number of passengers carried increased by 
21% in March to 1.7 million from 1.4 million in the same month the year before, as load factor increased by one 
percentage point to 86.3% from 85.3%.
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 1.7% at EUR13.63 Wednesday, while Wizz Air shares were down 0.7% at 
1,861.68p.

LONDON (Alliance News) -  UBS said Wizz Air Holdings hold a competitive edge over Ryanair Holdings as Central 
and Eastern Europe's largest airline as it continues to deliver on low-cost execution.
The Swiss bank reiterated its Buy rating on the stock and left its 2,350 pence price target unchanged. Shares were 
up 3.9% at 1,890.00p. 
Earlier this month, Wizz Air said underlying net profit in its current financial year should reach the top end of its 
guidance following a strong performance in the year so far.
UBS analyst Jarrod Castle said the greatest near-term risk to Wizz Air is ramifications of the UK's possible exit from 
Europe, but nevertheless Wizz will see a strong summer schedule and continue to deliver margin enhancement.
"Although Brexit is likely to exert investor caution (given that the UK generates the greatest source of revenues) we 
think with a six to twelve month view the shares will deliver positive returns," Castle said.
The analyst also said there is plenty of "runway" for low-cost airlines like Wizz Air and Ryanair to grow. The 
competitive advantage budget carriers have over its larger counterparts is likely to persist due to the younger fleets, 
greater presences in secondary airports and higher aircraft and crew utilisation. 
Castle also suggested Wizz Air holds a competitive edge over its Irish peer.
"Furthermore, although Ryanair remains a fierce competitor we think that both parties remain disciplined on pricing 
in relation to each other and that Wizz has displayed a history of successfully competing against Ryanair to become 
the largest Central and Eastern European airline," he said.
Moreover, Castle believed the propensity for short-haul flights will increase in the near term.
"In our view Wizz is one of the top three low cost producers and indeed we would classify them as an ultra-low cost 
operator," Castle added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened flat Monday, with Anglo American leading the gainers in 
the FTSE 100 after selling its 70% stake in an Australian coal mine. 
The FTSE 100 was 0.71 point higher at 6,146.76 points. In Europe, the CAC 40 index in Paris was down 0.7% and 
the DAX 30 in Frankfurt down 0.4%
Anglo American was up 2.0%, after the blue-chip miner said it has agreed to sell its 70% stake in the Foxleigh 
metallurgical coal mine in Queensland, Australia. No financial details on the sale were disclosed, but Anglo said it 
has sold the stake to a consortium led by Taurus Fund Management.
Foxleigh is an open-cut coal mine which produces high-quality pulverised coal injection coal, Anglo said. It is 
located in the Bowen Basin in Queensland and delivered 1.86 million tonnes of production attributable to Anglo in 
2015.
Gas distribution and production company Centrica was up 0.5%. The group is in early talks over a tie-up with the oil 
and gas production arm of Engie, the French state-backed energy giant, the Sunday Times reported without saying 
where it got the information.
The report said that Centrica is "understood" to have hired investment bank JP Morgan for advice. Engie and 
Centrica co-own Cygnus, one of the largest gas fields in the North Sea.
The FTSE 250 was flat at 16,843.11 points and the AIM All-Share was up 0.1% at 712.55. 
Mid-cap wealth manager Brewin Dolphin was up 0.8% after being upgraded to Buy from Hold by N+1 Singer.

Polymetal International said it has reached a binding agreement with a subsidiary of multi-commodities miner and 
trading house Glencore to acquire Orion Minerals, the holding company for the Komarovskoye gold deposit in 
Kazakhstan.
FTSE 250-listed Polymetal will pay USD100.0 million in cash to Kazzinc, a Glencore-owned business, to buy the 
site. Kazzinc also will receive a deferred consideration linked to future production from the deposit.
Shares in Polymetal were down 0.4%.
Shares in Ryanair Holdings were up 0.8%. The Irish budget airline reported growth in customer traffic and load 
factor in March year-on-year.  The group said passenger traffic grew by more than a quarter to 8.5 million in March 
from 6.6 million in March 2015, as load factor rose to 94% from 90%. Rolling annual traffic to March grew by 18% to 
106.4 million customers.
In London Main Market, Chemring Group was up 6.5%. The group said the implementation of its ammunition 
contract with a customer in the Middle East has started, with a letter of credit in place and an advance payment now 
received.
Chemring, which makes countermeasures such as flares and decoys that military aircraft use against missile attack, 
as well as sensors and electronics used in military vehicles, was forced into a profit warning in October 2015 due to 
delays on the ammunition contract, which was signed in September last year.
On Monday, however, Chemring said in-house and supply-chain production has started on the contract, with initial 
revenue to be recognised in the second quarter of its current financial year to the end of October. Chemring expects 
the deal to make a significant contribution to its results in the 2016 financial year.
The oil price was hit Friday by the news that Saudi Arabia will freeze crude production only if Iran and others follow 
suit. Bloomberg reported that the kingdom's deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, signalled in an interview 
that, if any country raises output, Saudi Arabia will follow suit.
Oil producers are scheduled to meet in Doha in Qatar this month to complete an accord capping output. Iran is 
expected to the attend the talks but has ruled out limiting oil supply as it aims to regain market share after sanctions 
were lifted in January.
Brent stood at USD38.59 a barrel at the London equities close on Friday, but has declined further to lows not 
touched in nearly a month. Brent was quoted at USD38.28 a barrel shortly after the open Monday. Analysts believe 
that if Brent were to touch the technical support of USD38, it could easily add to its losses. 
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 5.1%. The Hong Kong and Shanghai markets are 
closed Monday for the Ching Ming Festival celebrations in China. 
In the economic calendar Monday, UK construction PMI is due at 0930 BST. The eurozone unemployment rate and

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets climbed for much of the morning Monday, before settling into a 
midday range. The markets pared their gains in the afternoon and ended the day modestly higher. The euro area 
unemployment rate fell to the lowest level since August 2011 and producer prices declined the most in more than 
six years in February. Eurozone investor confidence improved in April, but came in below expectations.
There was little impact from the performance of the Asian markets at the start of the trading week. Markets in 
mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were closed for public holidays today.
Weakness in the US equity markets contributed to some of the late day sell-off in Europe. The US markets began to 
slide after comments from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates 
faster than markets anticipate if the US economy continues to withstand turbulence overseas, according to 
Rosengren.
Less than a week after Fed Chair Janet Yellen urged caution on raising interest rates, Rosengren joins a chorus 
regional Fed leaders hinting that normalization should occur sooner than later.
"While problems could still arise, I would expect that the very slow removal of accommodation reflected in futures 
market pricing could prove too pessimistic," Rosengren said.
"If, as I expect the economy data continue to show a moderate recovery, it will likely be appropriate to resume the 
path of gradual tightening sooner than is implied by financial-market futures," he said.
The European Central Bank will continue acting in a forceful manner against risks of low inflation in the euro area, 
ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet said Monday.
"The prolonged period of low inflation we are in today has increased the risks that inflation misses might become 
persistent, which would be deeply damaging for the economy," Praet said in a speech in Rome.

"This is why we have reacted so forcefully to secure our objective - and will continue to do so in the future if 
necessary."
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks increased 0.30%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, added 0.57%.
The DAX of Germany climbed 0.28% and the CAC 40 of France rose 0.53%. The FTSE 100 of the UK gained 
0.30% and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.57%.
In Frankfurt, Merck jumped 3.42% and Bayer added 1.63%. Fresenius increased 2.70% and Fresenius Medical 
Care gained 1.59%.
In Paris, Bouygues Telecom sank 13.45% and Orange tumbled 6.17% after talks between them over a planned 
takeover of the former's telecoms unit collapsed on Friday. Rivals Iliad and Numericable lost about 15 and 18% 
respectively.
Shares of Sanofi finished higher by 4.37%.
In London, low-cost airline Ryanair fell 0.85% after its March traffic grew by 28%.
Anglo American gained 1.69%. The embattled miner has sold its 70% stake in an open cut coal mine in 
Queensland, Australia, to a consortium led by Taurus Fund Management for an undisclosed sum.
Packaging and paper group Mondi dropped 2.52% after the Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian 
Federation said it had initiated an investigation into Mondi Syktyvkar for violations of antimonopoly law over offset 
paper.
Shire climbed 2.89% and GlaxoSmithKline added 0.92%.
ArcelorMittal increased 1.93% in Amsterdam. ArcelorMittal USA intends to enter into a new, five-year senior 
secured asset-based revolving credit facility of up to USD1 billion, which is expected to close in the second quarter 
of 2016.
Castellum AB gained 0.08% in Stockholm after creating a new group structure.
The euro area unemployment rate fell to the lowest since August 2011, data from Eurostat showed Monday. The 
jobless rate dropped marginally to 10.3% in February from revised 10.4% in January.
Economists had forecast the rate to remain unchanged at January's originally estimated rate of 10.3%.
Eurozone investor confidence improved slightly in April, survey results by Sentix showed Monday. The investor 
confidence index rose to 5.7 in April from 5.5 in March. Nonetheless, it was below the expected score of 7.
Eurozone producer prices declined at a faster-than-expected in February, figures from Eurostat showed Monday. 
The producer price index fell 4.2% year-over-year in February, much faster than the 3.0% decrease in January, 
which was revised from a 2.9% drop reported earlier. Economists had expected a 4.0% fall for the month.
British construction growth held steady in March, defying economists' expectations for an ease, survey data from 
Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply showed Monday.
The Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 54.2 in March, the same reading as 
February's 10-month low. Economists had expected the index to fall slightly to 54.1.
Orders for US manufactured goods declined in February, according to new government data released on Monday. 
The slide more than reversed an increase seen in the previous month.
European Markets Finished Nearly Flat After Early Gains Eroded
The US Department of Commerce said factory orders fell 1.7% in February. This followed 1.2% rise in the previous 
month. January's figure was revised lower from a previously reported increase of 1.6%. Economists had expected 
the measure to fall by 1.6% in the latest reading.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating on easyJet shares as it takes a 
contrarian view on the challenges facing the budget airline.
In the past 18 months, shares in easyJet have underperformed rival Ryanair Holdings by around 40%, and they 
have been the worst performing European airline stock in Merrill Lynch's coverage in 2016 to date.
In investors' minds, easyJet has "fallen from grace", Merrill Lynch said, as Ryanair has retaken the initiative and 
reassumed its place as the leading stock in the European low-cost airline expansion story.
In addition, rising costs, downward pressure on pricing, increasing competitive capacity, high fuel hedging, an 
appreciating dollar, and inconsistent earnings momentum all have served to weigh on easyJet shares, the broker 
said.
However, Merrill Lynch said easyJet's summer capacity trends are moderating, which may result in a pricing uplift 
for average fares, while shares also should get a boost from the company's upcoming summer cost-savings plans.
The bank added that easyJet shares look to have been pressured by uncertainty over the upcoming referendum on 
the UK's place in the European Union. However, the direct issues for easyJet of this seem to have been overdone, 
Merrill Lynch said.
The two key Brexit concerns raised for easyJet - currency fluctuations and potential complications from trade 
agreement renegotiations - both look manageable, Merrill Lynch said.
As a result, the broker upgraded easyJet to Buy from Neutral with a 1,800 pence price target, up from 1,660p. 
easyJet shares were up 1.7% to 1,527.00p, one of the best performers in the FTSE 100 Tuesday.
The valuation on easyJet, Merrill Lynch said, looks "appealing" at 10-times 2016 earnings, below its historical 
average of 12-times despite easyJet looking like a long-term secular winner in the airline space, "a sector survivor 
and value creator", in Merrill Lynch's view.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - European shares fell on Tuesday amid risk aversion after multiple explosions in Brussels 
left at least thirteen dead and thirty five injured.
Three were three explosions in Brussels, one at a subway station in the suburb of Maalbeek, while two explosions 
occurred at the city's airport. The terror threat in Belgium was raised to its highest level.
With investors rushing into safe-haven assets such as the yen, gold and government bonds, a raft of economic data 
releases on Eurozone private sector growth, UK inflation and German economic confidence received little attention 
from markets.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index traded down about 0.7% after ending a choppy session 0.2% lower on 
Monday, tracking moves in the US dollar and oil prices.
Elsewhere, the German DAX was moving down half a percent, France's CAC 40 was losing 1.3% and the UK's 
FTSE 100 was down 0.6%.
Hotel group Accor slumped nearly 4% in Paris while supermarket chain Carrefour dropped 1%.
EasyJet, Ryanair Holdings and InterContinental Hotels lost 2-3% in London.
Thomas Cook shares plunged 6%. The holiday firm has reported a two percent dip in winter bookings and said that 
summer holiday bookings are lower than this time last year due to volatile market conditions.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday called on Northern Ireland to vote 'yes' to stay in 
the European Union when the referendum is held on June 23, as it launched its Belfast winter 2016 schedule.
The Dublin-based low-cost airline said it has added seven new routes from Belfast to Alicante, Berlin, Krakow, 
Lanzarote, Malaga, Milan and Tenerife, as well as five extra daily flights to London Gatwick in its winter 2016 
schedule.
This will deliver over 1 million customers a year and support over 750 on-site jobs, Ryanair said.
"This large inward investment (over USD300 million) and new job creation is the latest example of how Northern 
Ireland benefits from the UK's membership of the European Union. Low fare air travel is one of the EU's great 
success stories," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
"We are calling on everyone in Northern Ireland to vote 'Yes' to Europe in the Brexit referendum in June, because 
staying in Europe will mean stronger economic growth, more tourism and more jobs for young people," he added.
Earlier Thursday, Ryanair reported year-on-year growth in both customer traffic and load factor in February. 
Customer traffic grew by 28% to 7.4 million from 5.8 million, while load factor increased by four percentage points to 
93% from 89%.
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 0.5% at EUR14.07 on Thursday afternoon.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it wants Google to ban travel agency 
eDreams from advertising for Ryanair flights after the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the advertising 
on Google was "misleading" to consumers and breached the advertising CAP code.
The UK ASA reviewed a series of complaints from consumers who were misled into believing that links in eDreams 
advertising for Ryanair and easyJet PLC flights led to official Ryanair and easyJet content.
eDreams responded by arguing that their adverts did not claim to be the official websites for Ryanair and easyJet, 
but the UK ASA ruled that the travel agency made more prominent references to the two airlines lines over itself 
and that the implications suggested they were the official websites.
Ryanair said the eDreams adverts duped consumers into booking higher priced tickets through eDreams rather 
than those available on Ryanair's own website, an issue which it had previously already complained to Google 
about.
On the back of the ruling, Ryanair said it now wants Google to ban eDreams advertising until it "stops misleading 
consumers by passing itself off as Ryanair".
"We again call on Google to delist eDreams until all references to Ryanair have been removed from the eDreams 
advertising. Ryanair has no difficulty with eDreams promoting itself as eDreams, but when it uses Google's paid for 
search to pass itself off as 'Ryanair', then consumers are, and will continue to be misled," Chief Marketing Officer 
Kenny Jacobs said in a statement.
"Ryanair will be using this latest ASA ruling as part of our continuing legal action against eDreams and Google to 
put an end to this misleading advertising, which both eDreams and Google are profiting from," he added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it calls for a 'yes' vote for Great Britain to 
stay in the European Union when the referendum is held on June 23.
The Irish budget airline said it remains critical of both UK and EU government "failure" to promote low fare tourism 
growth in areas such as the UK travel tax and continuing indecision over additional runway capacity in the south 
east. 
However, it said it remains a "committed supporter" of the UK remaining in Europe as this will lead to more UK jobs 
and better economic growth, while EU open skies have already "transformed" UK tourism. 
Ryanair also noted that free movement of goods and services have made the UK one of Europe's "most competitive 
and best performing economies", while Prime Minister David Cameron's negotiated reforms "protect sterling, limit 
immigration and closer union, while reducing bureaucracy".
Finally, the airline added that it thinks foreign inward investment in the UK will be lost to Ireland and Germany if the 
UK leaves Europe.
"Ryanair is absolutely clear that the UK economy and its future growth prospects are stronger as a member of the 
European Union than they are outside of the EU," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
"Leaving Europe won't save the UK money or red tape because, like Norway, the UK will still have to contribute to 
Europe and obey its rules if it wants to continue to trade freely with Europe," he added.
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 0.1% at EUR13.89 on Wednesday afternoon.

LONDON (Alliance News) - A group of more than 100 leaders of major businesses on Tuesday backed Prime 
Minister David Cameron's campaign for Britain to remain in the EU, saying a British exit, or Brexit, would "deter 
investment and threaten jobs."
"Business needs unrestricted access to the European market of 500 million people in order to continue to grow, 
invest and create jobs," the business leaders said in a letter published in the Times.
"We believe that leaving the EU would deter investment, threaten jobs and put the economy at risk," the letter read.
The nearly 200 signatories included top executives from 36 companies listed on London's FTSE 100 index.
Among the companies represented are Airbus UK, British Telecom, BP, Diageo, EasyJet, Goldman Sachs 
International, GlaxoSmithKline, HSBC, Rio Tinto, Rolls Royce, Royal Dutch Shell, Ryanair, SABMiller, Siemens 
Manufacturing, Standard Chartered, Virgin Media and Vodafone.
"The businesses we lead represent every sector and region of the UK," they wrote. "Together we employ hundreds 
of thousands of people across the country."
Cameron's deal with the 27 other EU leaders last week means "Britain is better off staying in a reformed EU," they 
added, highlighting agreements to reduce bureaucracy, deepen the single market and pursue international trade 
deals.
The Confederation of British Industry, which represents some 190,000 businesses, has also backed Cameron, 
praising the EU reform package as "a major step forward."
Britain will conduct a referendum on June 23 on whether or not to remain part of the EU.
Eurosceptics inside Cameron's ruling Conservative party have provided the strongest support for the "leave" 
campaign.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Cantor Fitzgerald raised its revenue and net profit forecasts for Ryanair, saying the 
budget airline is enjoying strong trading and unrivalled cash generation in the sector, but warned that earnings 
momentum may be difficult to maintain.
The broker noted Ryanair's third-quarter results on Monday were damped by the recent terrorist attacks in Paris but 
that full-year guidance was maintained, in line with which it has raised its forecasts.
Cantor's revenue estimate for financial 2016 has been lifted by 5.9% to EUR6.54 billion and net profit by 27% to 
EUR1.26 billion. Ryanair's guidance is for post-tax profit to be at the upper end of a EUR1.17 billion to EUR1.22 
billion range.
However, while Cantor recognised Ryanair's growth over the past few years as being "exceptional", it said it is 
concerned earnings momentum may be difficult to maintain as persistently low fuel prices bring more capacity into 
the market, leading to Ryanair's "ambitious" expansion plans.
Cantor raised its price target to EUR15.5 from EUR14 and maintained its Hold rating on the stock.
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 1.8% at EUR13.83 on Thursday close to midday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - easyJet PLC on Thursday reported growth in passengers carried in January but a small 
decline in load factor, while rival budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC posted an increase in both customer traffic 
and load factor.
easyJet said the number of passengers carried rose 6.3% to 4.3 million in January from 4.0 million in the same 
month the year before, but load factor decreased very slightly by 0.1 of a percentage point to 85.0% from 85.1%.
On a rolling 12-month basis, passengers carried increased 7.2% to 70.1 million from 65.3 million, while load factor 
grew by 0.8 of a percentage point to 91.6% from 90.8%.
Irish carrier Ryanair said customer traffic grew by a quarter in January to 7.5 million from 6.0 million, as load factor 
increased by 5 percentage points to 88.0% from 83.0%.
Rolling annual traffic was up 17% to 102.9 million customers.
On Wednesday, International Consolidated Airlines Group said both group traffic and load factor rose in January. 
Group traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, grew 12% year-on-year to 17.3 million from 15.5 million, 
while load factor increased by 1.7 percentage points to 78.7% from 77.0%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings signalled a "subtle change in direction" in its third quarter earnings, 
Barclays said, indicating it is comfortable with a slower growth rate and the benefits of its strategic shift will be 
passed on to shareholders rather than customers.
The Irish budget carrier on Monday said its post-tax profit, revenue and customer numbers all increased in the third 
quarter to the end of December, and it affirmed its guidance for its full financial year, albeit saying the outcome 
would be dependent on no unforeseen events hitting operations.
The group also said it will launch a EUR800.0 million share buyback, which will start later this week and last about 
nine months. It marks the largest share buyback yet launched by the company.
Barclays said Ryanair pointed to a change in direction for the 2017 financial year and beyond. Barclays said the 
carrier did away with major traffic upgrades, double-digit capacity expansion and prophecies of fuel savings that 
would then be competed away through competitive pricing wars with rivals.
Instead, a "more measured tone" was struck by the company, suggesting it would be "content" with a slower 7-10% 
growth in profit and flat load factors and hinting at a "modicum of pricing power" and scope to cut costs.
With the big increase in cash returns, Barclays said Ryanair's management "seems happy to acknowledge that the 
financial benefits of its strategic transformation will be passed to shareholders, and not customers."
The bank kept an Overweight rating and EUR20.00 price target on Ryanair, shares in which were down 0.7% to 
EUR14.40 on Wednesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said its post-tax profit, revenue and customer 
numbers all increased in the third quarter to the end of December, and it affirmed its guidance for its full financial 
year, albeit saying the outcome would be dependent on no unforeseen events hitting operations.
The Irish low-cost airline said its profit after tax for the three months to the end of December was EUR103.0 million, 
more than double the EUR49.0 million it made a year earlier. Revenue rose to EUR1.33 billion from EUR1.13 
billion, as the number of passengers carried increased to 24.9 million from 20.8 million.
The group also said it will launch a EUR800.0 million share buyback, which will start later this week and last about 
nine months. Ryanair said the buyback will raise the total amount it has returned to shareholders to over EUR4.0 
billion in the past eight years.
"We are pleased to report that our low fares policy delivered strong third quarter traffic and profit growth," said 
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive.
O'Leary said fare pricing weakened in the later part of the quarter, mainly due to the residual effects of the Paris 
terror attacks in November, which damped enthusiasm for travel in Europe. As a result of Ryanair launching 
promotions and cutting prices to keep customers on board, average fares for the quarter fell 1.0%, slightly weaker 
than previous guidance for flat pricing.
Ryanair said it remains confident it will hit its guidance for the year to the end of March, though cautioned this would 
be dependent on no further unforeseen events, similar to the Paris attacks, occurring in the quarter and hitting 
demand.
The group now expects its traffic for the fourth quarter to grow ahead of previous guidance and said this would 
offset a decline in average ticket prices. It expects its total passenger traffic for the year to hit 106 million, up from 
105 million previously, which would be up 17% year-on-year from the 90.6 million it carried in the 2015 financial 
year.
UPDATE: Ryanair Affirms Full-Year Guidance, Launches Share Buyback
Margins will also be helped by lower costs, which Ryanair expects to drop around 6.0% for the full year, mainly due 
to lower fuel prices as a result of the fall in the oil price.

LONDON (Alliance News) - RBC Capital Markets remained positive on Ryanair Holdings following the Irish carrier's 
third-quarter results, but both Liberum and Cantor Fitzgerald were slightly more cautious on the outlook, with 
Liberum in particularly concerned about non-fuel cost controls for the company.
Ryanair Holdings on Monday said its post-tax profit, revenue and customer numbers all increased in the third 
quarter to the end of December, and it affirmed its guidance for its full financial year, albeit saying the outcome 
would be dependent on no unforeseen events hitting operations.
The Irish low-cost carrier said its profit after tax for the three months to the end of December was EUR103.0 million, 
more than double the EUR49.0 million it made a year earlier. Revenue rose to EUR1.33 billion from EUR1.13 
billion, as the number of passengers carried increased to 24.9 million from 20.8 million.
RBC Capital Markets was positive in its stance on Ryanair as it maintained its Outperform rating and EUR18.00 
price target.
"Ryanair continues to build profits and frequency on routes and we see a likely continuing yield benefit from 
frequency growth," said RBC analyst Damian Brewer.
The analyst added that looking ahead Ryanair could exploit gaps in the Boeing order books due to weakness in 
emerging markets and US dollar strength. While lower spot fuel costs on incremental capacity presents the 
opportunity to "increase growth in a tactical manner".
Brewer said Ryanair's shares trade at a discount to its larger peer easyJet and sees both absolute and relative 
upside in the shares, making the Irish carrier one of RBC's top 30 global picks for 2016.
Liberum said Ryanair's revenue came ahead of its expectations, but costs were slightly worse. Route charges were 
better than forecast, but this was offset by all other costs being weaker than the broker had anticipated, including 
interest costs.
IN THE KNOW: RBC Positive On Ryanair , But Liberum Cautious On Costs
The broker kept its rating and Hold and left its EUR13.90 price target unchanged.
Liberum said Ryanair's customary premium valuation to the rest of the European airline industry remains justified. 
However, the broker said Ryanair looks attractive when taking into account March 2017 forecasts, but said visibility 
beyond the current year is limited.
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said he was cautious on Ryanair's non-fuel costs and, while the company has a 
strong track record on costs, neither Liberum's forecasts nor the stock's premium rating provide any space for it to 
disappoint.
Third quarter unit costs have continued to track higher on an ex-fuel per seat basis. Higher load factors are also 
driving better revenue per seat to compensate, but with a third quarter load factor of 93%, Khoo suggested that this 
cannot continue at the same pace or for much longer. 
"We assume management can get these back under control, but see downside risk if it does not," said Khoo.
Cantor Fitzgerald said Ryanair's third-quarter profit missed consensus by 5.5% due to the impact of the Paris terror 
attacks on trading, though the situation appears to have recovered.
The broker reiterated its Hold rating on Ryanair and kept its price target at EUR14.00.
Ryanir also said it will launch a EUR800.0 million share buyback, which will start later this week and last about nine 
months. Ryanair said the buyback will raise the total amount it has returned to shareholders to over EUR4.0 billion 
in the past eight years.
Cantor was positive over the move saying the buyback demonstrates the strength of Ryanair's fundamentals. "That 
said, we think that the stock is fairly valued following a strong outperformance," said Cantor's Robin Byde.
Ryanair shares were up 5.4% at EUR14.49 on Monday afternoon.

LONDON (Alliance News) - BT Group shares closed higher on Monday amid a mixed trading session for UK stocks, 
with the telecommunications company reporting higher third-quarter profit and revealing a new organisational 
structure, while on the currency markets the pound rose against the dollar following weak US economic data and 
upbeat figures from the UK. 
The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.4% at 6,060.10, the FTSE 250 flat at 16,489.26, while the AIM All-Share up 
0.4% at 696.16. In Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 0.6% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt down 0.4%.
BT ended up 2.8% after the telecommunications and pay-TV company confirmed its guidance for the full financial 
year. The group reported an increase in pretax profit in its third quarter and year to date, and outlined a new 
organisational structure following its acquisition of mobile network EE.
For the quarter to end-December BT reported a pretax profit of GBP862 million, up from GBP694 million a year 
before, as revenue rose to GBP4.64 billion from GBP4.48 billion. This takes BT's pretax profit for the first nine 
months of its financial year to GBP2.14 billion, up from GBP1.8 billion a year before, on revenue of GBP13.25 
billion, up from GBP13.21 billion.
BT said that, following its acquisition of EE, it will have a new organisational structure with effect from April. Under 
the new structure, it will have six lines of business, comprising Consumer, EE, Business & Public Sector, Global 
Services, Wholesale & Ventures and Openreach.
Fellow pay-TV company Sky rose 1.4%, after Citigroup added the stock to its Europe Focus List.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: BT Shines While Sterling Rises After Weak US Data
Shares in Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings ended up 1.6%. The group said its post-tax profit, revenue and 
customer numbers all increased in the third quarter to the end of December, and it affirmed its guidance for its full 
financial year, albeit saying the outcome would be dependent on no unforeseen events hitting operations.
Ryanair said its profit after tax for the three months to the end of December was EUR103.0 million, more than 
double the EUR49.0 million it made a year earlier. Revenue rose to EUR1.33 billion from EUR1.13 billion, as the 
number of passengers carried increased to 24.9 million from 20.8 million. 
The group also said it will launch a EUR800.0 million share buyback, which will start later this week and last about 
nine months. Ryanair said the buyback will raise the total amount it has returned to shareholders to over EUR4.0 
billion in the past eight years.
London-listed air carriers finished among the best blue-chip performers, with easyJet up 2.0% and International 
Consolidated Airlines Group up 2.4%. 
Lower crude prices, which retreated from the highs seen in early trade, supported airlines shares but dragged on oil 
producers. 
North Sea benchmark Brent oil was quoted at USD34.73 a barrel at the London close, having touched USD36.22 a 
barrel, a level it hadn't seen since so far in the year. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was at USD32.05 a 
barrel, also down from USD34.10 a barrel reached earlier in the day. 
The FTSE 350 Oil & Gas Producers Sector index closed down 1.6%, after seven consecutive sessions of gains. BP 
ended down 3.2%, while Royal Dutch Shell 'B' shares ended down 1.4%, and BG Group closed down 0.5%. Mid-
cap Cairn Energy ended down 1.6%.
BP will be the first major London-listed oil and gas company to report its final results on Tuesday, ahead of results 
from Royal Dutch Shell on Wednesday and BG Group, which will imminently complete its merger with Shell, due on 
Thursday. BP's results will therefore provide the first insight into the impact of lower oil prices on the major 
producers during 2015. 
According to consensus estimates provided by the company, analysts are expecting BP to report an underlying 
replacement cost profit of only USD730.0 million in the last quarter of 2015, representing a 66% drop from USD2.20 
billion in the same quarter a year earlier and a fall of more than 59% from the USD1.80 billion booked in the third 
quarter of 2015. 
Life insurer Prudential ended at the bottom of the FTSE 100, down 3.5%. The group said the chief executive of its 
M&G Investments fund management arm is to retire from his role and said it has poached the chief investment 
officer of Aberdeen Asset Management to replace him.
Michael McLintock will retire as the chief executive of M&G and as an executive director of the group this year, 
though no exact date was given for his departure, after 19 years with the company. He will be replaced by Anne 
Richards, currently the chief investment officer and head of Aberdeen's European, Middle East and African 
operations.
Shares in Aberdeen Asset Management dropped 0.7%.
In the FTSE 250, Home Retail Group led the mid-cap gainers, up 8.0% after Bloomberg reported that supermarket 
J Sainsbury is close to reaching an agreement to acquire the owner of Argos and Homebase and could get an 
extension to the offer deadline in order to hash out the final details. Shares in Sainsbury's ended down 0.6%.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: BT Shines While Sterling Rises After Weak US Data
Citing four people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg said the pair have narrowed their differences over how much 
Sainsbury's should pay for Home Retail. The sources said Home Retail may now ask the UK Takeover Panel to 
extend the deadline for Sainsbury's to make a firm offer for the company, which is due to fall on Tuesday.
No final decision has been made, and the deal could yet fall apart, the sources told Bloomberg.
The Financial Times had reported earlier that Sainsbury's was facing pressure to increase its offer for Home Retail 
from two major shareholders.
US stocks were lower at the London close, with the Dow 30 down 0.4%, the S&P 500 down 0.4% and the Nasdaq 
Composite down 0.3%. 
Alphabet, the new corporate umbrella for Google and all of its diverse businesses, is expected to report its first set 
of results under that name after the US market close on Monday, providing investors with a fourth-quarter update. 
Barbie doll maker Mattel also is expected to publish a fourth-quarter update after the US market close. 
The dollar retreated against the pound after a weak set of US economic data that followed better-than-expected 
manufacturing and mortgage approvals data from the UK.
The US Commerce Department said in a report that US construction spending rose much less than expected in 
December, with a jump in spending on public construction partly offset by a drop in spending on private 
construction. The report said construction spending inched up 0.1% in December, having fallen 0.6% in November. 
Economists had expected spending to climb by 0.6%.
Meanwhile, US manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth straight month in January, according to a report 
released by the Institute for Supply Management. The ISM said its purchasing manager's index rose to 48.2 in 
January from a downwardly revised 48.0 in December. However, economists expected the index to climb to 48.3. A 
reading below 50 continues to indicate a contraction in manufacturing activity.
UK manufacturing growth quickened unexpectedly at the start of the year to the strongest level in three months. 
Data from Markit Economics showed that the Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Purchasing 
Managers' Index for manufacturing rose to 52.9 in January from 52.1 in December. Economists had expected the 
index to fall to 51.8.
Data from the Bank of England showed that UK mortgage approvals rose unexpectedly to 70,837 in December from 
70,424 in November. This was the highest since August 2015. Economists had forecast approvals to fall to 69,600 
in December.
At the London close, sterling was quoted at USD1.4370. 
The euro area manufacturing sector growth slowed as estimated in January with rates of expansion in output, new 
orders and new export business all easing at the start of the year, final survey data from Markit showed Monday. 
The final manufacturing PMI fell to 52.3 in January from 53.2 in December. The reading matched flash estimate, 
having remained above the 50.0 mark for 31 consecutive months.
The euro was quoted at USD1.0889 at the London close. Meanwhile, the gold price was at USD1,126.39 an ounce.
Also in the UK corporate calendar Tuesday, Ocado Group releases full-year results, while TalkTalk Telecom Group 
issues a trading statement. St Modwen Properties, Mattioli Woods, Polar Capital Global Financials Trust and Low & 
Bonar publish full-year results, while NWF Group and Alumasc Group release half-year results.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: BT Shines While Sterling Rises After Weak US Data
In the economic calendar, German unemployment data are due at 0855 GMT, while UK's construction PMI is at 
0930 GMT. Eurozone unemployment rate and producer price index are due at 1000 GMT. In the US, the Redbook 
index is due at 1355 GMT.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - European shares gave up early gains on Monday, as oil prices fell around 2% following 
last week's sharp rally and disappointing data out of China and South Korea rekindled growth worries.
Asian markets surrendered early gains to end mixed, with Chinese stocks coming under significant selling pressure 
after the latest batch of manufacturing and service sector data heightened concerns of a deeper economic 
slowdown.
US stock futures also drifted lower amid fresh concerns over China's economy. After disappointing fourth-quarter 
GDP data, investors await US personal income and spending, construction spending and manufacturing PMI 
numbers later in the day for further clues on the future path of rate increases.
Closer home, the pan-European STOXX 600 was down about 0.1% after climbing 2.2% on Friday, supported by 
higher oil prices and hopes for more stimulus measures in China, Europe and Japan.
Elsewhere, the German DAX, France's CAC 40 and the UK's FTSE 100 were down between 0.4% and 0.6%.
Commodity-related shares traded mostly lower in London, with Antofagasta, BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell losing 
1-2%.
Rolls-Royce Holdings slid half a percent despite winning a USD2.7 billion order for Trent 1000 engines.
HSBC Holdings dropped 2% on a report it will impose a hiring and pay freeze globally in 2016 as part of its drive to 
cut as much as USD5 billion in costs by the end of 2017.
BT Group rallied 3% after the telecoms giant delivered a strong performance in the final quarter of 2015 and 
announced a new organizational structure.
Ryanair Holdings jumped 4% after strong third-quarter earnings.
European Shares Give Up Early Gains
Dialog Semiconductor rose over 2% in Frankfurt. The chipmaker is eyeing new acquisition targets to spur growth, 
its chief executive told German weekly Euro am Sonntag.
Lab equipment maker Sartorius climbed 5% after updating its medium-term forecast.
Nokia shares fell more than 10% after the Finnish firm said it had settled a lengthy patent dispute with South 
Korea's Samsung.
In economic releases, the euro area manufacturing sector growth slowed as estimated in January with rates of 
expansion in output, new orders and new export business all easing at the start of the year, final survey data from 
Markit showed.
While British manufacturing growth quickened unexpectedly at the start of the year to the strongest level in three 
months, UK mortgage approvals rose unexpectedly to 70,837 in December from 70,424 in November.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets ended the first session of the new trading week in the red. 
Following the rally at the end of the prior trading week, stocks gave up early gains Monday due to falling crude oil 
prices and renewed concerns over China. Disappointing Chinese manufacturing data spooked investors and 
caused oil prices to turn lower.
Chinese manufacturers signaled deterioration in operating conditions at the start of 2016 but the pace of contraction 
slowed slightly from December, the results of a private survey showed Monday.
However, official data released by the government showed that the manufacturing sector underwent a faster 
contraction than seen at the end of 2015.
The Caixin Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 48.4 in January from 48.2 in December, Markit said. Nonetheless, 
activity has been contracting for the eleventh successive month.
At the same time, the official manufacturing PMI fell to 49.4 in January from 49.7 in December. According to the 
National Bureau of Statistics report, the sector contracted for the sixth straight month.
The official non-manufacturing PMI dropped to 53.5 from 54.4 in December but stayed in positive territory.
The European Central Bank will review and possibly reconsider its monetary policy stance when it meets in March, 
Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said Monday.
"But for the recovery to become structural - and thus to increase growth potential and reduce structural 
unemployment - monetary policy does not suffice," policymaker said at a conference in Budapest.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks decreased 0.79%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, lost 0.43%.
European Markets Pulled Back On China Concerns, Falling Crude Prices
The DAX of Germany dropped 0.41% and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.56%. The FTSE of the UK declined 0.39% 
and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.11%.
In Frankfurt, Dialog Semiconductor rose 1.30%. The chipmaker is eyeing new acquisition targets to spur growth, its 
chief executive told German weekly Euro am Sonntag.
Lab equipment maker Sartorius climbed 6.86% after updating its medium-term forecast.
BMW dropped 1.64% and Daimler fell 0.65%. Volkswagen also finished lower by 0.94%.
In Paris, Total sank 2.25%, but Technip advanced 0.92%.
Vivendi decreased 5.34% and LafargeHolcim weakened by 2.73%.
In London, HSBC Holdings dropped 1.60% on a report it will impose a hiring and pay freeze globally in 2016 as part 
of its drive to cut as much as USD5 billion in costs by the end of 2017.
Rolls-Royce Holdings finished unchanged despite winning a USD2.7 billion order for Trent 1000 engines.
BT Group climbed 1.93% after the telecoms giant delivered a strong performance in the final quarter of 2015 and 
announced a new organizational structure.
Ryanair Holdings jumped 5.45% after strong third-quarter earnings.
Nokia sank 11.29% in Helsinki, after the firm said it had settled a lengthy patent dispute with South Korea's 
Samsung.
The euro area manufacturing sector growth slowed as estimated in January with rates of expansion in output, new 
orders and new export business all easing at the start of the year, final survey data from Markit showed Monday.
The final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 52.3 in January from 53.2 in December. The reading 
matched flash estimate.
British manufacturing growth quickened unexpectedly at the start of the year to the strongest level in three months, 
survey data from Markit Economics showed Monday. The Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply 
Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing rose to 52.9 in January from 52.1 in December. Economists had 
expected the index to fall to 51.8.
UK mortgage approvals rose to a 4-month high in December, the Bank of England reported Monday. The number of 
mortgage approvals rose unexpectedly to 70,837 in December from 70,424 in November. This was the highest 
since August 2015. Economists had forecast approvals to fall to 69,600 in December.
US manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth straight month in January, according to a report released by the 
Institute for Supply Management, although the index of activity in the sector did show a slight increase.
The ISM said its purchasing managers index inched up to 48.2 in January from a downwardly revised 48.0 in 
December, but a reading below 50 continues to indicate a contraction in manufacturing activity. Economists had 
expected the index to climb to a reading of 48.3 from the 48.2 originally reported for the previous month.
Personal income in the US rose in line with economist estimates in the month of December, according to a report 
released by the Commerce Department on Monday, although the report also said personal spending came in 
virtually unchanged.
The report said personal income climbed by 0.3% in December, matching the increase seen in November as well 
as economist estimates.
European Markets Pulled Back On China Concerns, Falling Crude Prices
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said personal spending edged down by less than 0.1% in December after 
rising by 0.5% in the previous month. Spending had been expected to inch up by 0.1%.
With a jump in spending on public construction partly offset by a drop in spending on private construction, the 
Commerce Department released a report on Monday showing that US construction spending rose much less than 
expected in December.
The Commerce Department said construction spending inched up 0.1% to an annual rate of USD1.117 trillion in 
December from the revised November estimate of USD1.116 trillion. Economists had expected spending to climb 
by 0.6%.

IN THE KNOW: Wizz Air's Costs Slightly Higher Than Nomura Expected

LONDON (Alliance News) - Nomura says Wizz Air Holdings remains an "impressive business" in its view, but said 
the airline's cost reductions look a little light against the bank's expectations and it continues to prefer Irish rival 
Ryanair Holdings.
On Wednesday, Eastern Europe-focused budget carrier Wizz Air said it carried more passengers and generated 
more revenue in its third quarter year-on-year, while it also upgraded its underlying profit estimate for the year as 
trading continued to prove strong.
Wizz Air said it now expects its underlying net profit for the full year to the end of March to be EUR200.0 million to 
EUR210.0 million. The underlying numbers strip out currency translation and one-off items and were upgraded from 
its previous guidance for EUR190.0 million to EUR200.0 million. The company also said unit costs were falling 
thanks to lower fuel prices, driven by the drop in oil prices.
Nomura said the upgrade to guidance was broadly in line with its existing expectations and said the key driver of 
the hike to profit guidance by Wizz Air was fuel. While the cost savings being accumulated from the fall in fuel 
prices remain strong, Nomura said this was being offset by higher ex-fuel costs.
Though Wizz Air guided to its ex-fuel costs rising 0% to 1% for the year, slightly better than its previous guidance of 
a 1.0% rise, this remains ahead of Nomura's expectation for a 0.5% fall.
Overall, the third quarter for Wizz Air was solid with costs under control, albeit trending slightly weaker for the full 
year than Nomura expected.
The bank said it continues to consider Wizz Air to be an impressive company but kept a Neutral rating on its shares, 
arguing Ryanair, a rival budget carrier, has a stronger valuation augmented by cash returns which are not reliant on 
asset sales.
Along with the Neutral rating, Nomura kept its 1,900 pence price target on Wizz Air intact.
IN THE KNOW: Wizz Air 's Costs Slightly Higher Than Nomura Expected
Shares in Wizz Air were down 1.7% to 1,829.00p Wednesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC Wednesday launched its winter 2016 schedule 
for Dublin Airport, which it said will deliver 12.3 million annual customers at the airport.
There will be 68 routes in total, including two new routes to Hamburg, Germany, and Sofia, Bulgaria, with 670 
weekly flights.
The company also said there will be five new winter services to Athens in Greece, Bologna in Italy, Porto in 
Portugal, and Murcia and Seville in Spain. 
"Last year Ryanair single handily delivered 70% of the growth at Dublin Airport, following the government's decision 
to scrap the air travel tax, and we look forward to continuing to grow tourism, routes and jobs," said Chief Marketing 
Officer Kenny Jacobs in a statement.
"Our 105 million customers can look forward to further improvements, as we continue our 'Always Getting Better' 
programme, which includes more new routes, a new app, new cabin interiors, new crew uniforms and improved 
inflight menus," Jacobs added. 
Shares in Ryanair were down 2.2% at EUR13.89 Wednesday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it has negotiated a five-
year pay and conditions deal  with its 76 cabin crew bases across Europe.
The agreement follows a similar move involving the budget airline's 76 pilot bases.
Ryanair said support for the deal was overwhelming, with more than 90% of cabin crew across its bases voting in 
favour.
The agreements give rise to guaranteed pay and allowance increases over the next five years, as well as "improved 
rosters" with five days on and three days off, improved sickness benefits, new cabin crew uniforms from February 1, 
and more crew promotions as the airline embarks on an eight-year, 400 new aircraft order.
Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said the airline has worked hard behind the scenes to negotiate the deals.
"The fact that Ryanair can use our improving financial performance to improve the pay and conditions of our 
frontline crew underlines the long standing success of Ryanair's collective bargaining model, which continues to 
deliver improved pay and conditions as well as job security for our pilots and cabin crew at a time when their 
counterparts in many other European airlines are facing job, pay and pension cuts or are engaged in industrial 
action to avoid such cuts," Eddie Wilson said in a statement.
Shares in Ryanair were down 3.1% at EUR14.27 on Wednesday afternoon.

AMSTERDAM (Alliance News) - Five major European airline groups launched a new alliance on Wednesday aimed 
at promoting their interests when dealing with national and EU regulators, with their sector facing fierce international 
competition.
Aviation firms employ almost two million people in the EU and are worth EUR110 billion to the bloc's economy, 
according to the European Commission, the bloc's executive.
But competitors such as Emirates Airline, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways have been gaining ground in the 
European market.
The new lobby group, Airlines for Europe (A4E), brings together Air France-KLM, easyjet, International Airlines 
Group, Lufthansa Group and Ryanair, and plans to expand its membership during the coming months.
"For the first time, low-cost and network carriers are creating an association to support the adoption of a new 
European aviation strategy," the heads of the five corporations said in a joint statement.
A4E said it would work with the commission on measures it had unveiled last month to boost the bloc's aviation 
sector.
The airlines aim to "increase their competitiveness and result in lower fares and more choice for passengers," by 
tackling industry issues such as "large-scale airport monopolies, high charges, taxation and inefficiencies," the 
statement said.
The group also presented its first study on Wednesday, showing that airport charges at the EU's 21 largest airports 
had increased by 80% in the last 10 years, while flight costs dropped 20% over the same period.
"While the airlines have reduced their fares, EU passengers continue to be fleeced by excessive airport charges," 
the group's chief executives said, urging the bloc to "take action lowering the cost of the EU's airports by ensuring 
that monopoly airports are effectively regulated."

LONDON (Alliance News) - Deutsche Bank issued a positive note on Ryanair Holdings on Wednesday, lifting its 
price target on the group to EUR17.60 from EUR14.80 and saying that the opportunities for the company are 
"plentiful" in the medium-term. 
Shares in Ryanair were down 3.7% at EUR14.55 Thursday morning. However, the stock experienced an 
unstoppable rise throughout 2015, increasing by more than 50%.
Deutsche Bank said that, having just passed the sixth anniversary of the bank's Buy recommendation on the Irish 
carrier, it still believes Ryannair is "the clearest winner in European aviation". 
The bank said Ryanair's development in the medium-term "seems clear: it should be bigger (but not at the expense 
of returns), more profitable and more free cash flow generative."
"Our sense is that in the short term, there is a sell-side race to see who can generate the highest target price on 
Ryanair and that this potentially overstates the immediate upside," said Deutsche Bank analyst Anand Date. 
"Nevertheless, we think the business model is superb, and we see the potential for many more years to our Buy 
recommendation."
Deutsche said it sees revenue upside on multiple fronts for the company: from closing the like-for-like sales yield 
discount to peers, from incremental volume as big data on individual customer behavior is utilized more effectively, 
and from driving complementary ancillary spend.
"The key therefore is that the company retains its keen focus on cost, and we see little risk of this changing under 
current management," noted Deutsche's Date.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget airlines easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC could soon be handling part of 
the journey for long-haul passengers in Europe amid a strategic shift by the two groups, the Financial Times 
reported.
Ireland's Ryanair has signalled plans to target tie-ups with flag carriers under which it would provide them with 
passengers for their long-haul flights. easyJet is understood to be considering a similar move, the FT said.
This could see Ryanair and easyJet strike up partnerships with companies such as British Airways, owned by FTSE 
100-listed International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, or Germany's Lufthansa AG, with passengers initially flying 
via the budget airlines, before then transferring onto the flag carriers' long-haul aircraft.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group on Friday reported a rise in group traffic in 
December but a decrease in load factor, which it said was due to the terrorist attack in Paris in November.
The airline said group traffic, which is measured in revenue passenger kilometres, increased 10.5% year-on-year to 
17.6 million from 15.9 million.
However, passenger load factor declined by 1.1 percentage points to 78.6% from 79.7%. IAG said this was 
because of the terrorist attack in Paris in November, which temporarily deterred customers from wanting to travel.
IAG added that guidance for full-year operating profit in 2015 remains unchanged at between EUR2.25 billion and 
EUR2.30 billion.
On Thursday, easyJet PLC also blamed the Paris attack on a fall in December's load factor. The low-cost airline 
said its load factor declined to 86.6% from 88.4%, while passenger traffic rose 4.6% year-on-year to 4.8 million from 
4.6 million.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, however, reported an increase in both passenger traffic and load factor in December. The 
Irish carrier said its load factor improved to 91.0% from 88.0%, while passenger traffic grew 25% year-on-year to 
7.5 million from 6.0 million.
Shares in IAG were trading up 0.4% at 592.50 pence on Friday afternoon, while easyJet shares were up 3.2% at 
1,722.00 and Ryanair shares were up 2.6% at EUR15.06.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Marks & Spencer Group said Chief Executive Marc Bolland will retire from his role this year as it reported a fall in 
group sales in the third quarter of its financial year, as a poor performance from its general merchandise division 
offset growth in the food division. The retailer said Bolland, who has been at the helm for six years, will step down in 
April after the close of the group's current financial year. He will be replaced by Steve Rowe, the executive director 
of the company's General Merchandise business, covering its clothing and homewares. The news came as M&S 
said group sales in the 13 weeks to December 26 fell 0.4% year-on-year, remaining flat at a constant currency 
basis, as food sales rose 3.7% but general merchandise dropped 5.0%. On a like-for-like basis, food grew 0.4% 
and general merchandise declined 5.8%.
----------
The former chief executive of Tesco is understood to be considering leading a potential takeover offer for Home 
Retail Group to rival the interest in the business shown by J Sainsbury, The Times reported. Terry Leahy, who 
stepped down from the helm of Tesco in 2011 having led its transformation into one of the biggest retailers in the 
world, is thought to be working with private equity investor Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, to which he is a consultant, on a 
bid for the owner of Argos and Homebase.
----------
The UK Financial Conduct Authority is investigating traders at Lloyds Banking Group over possible manipulation of 
the British government-bond market, the Wall Street Journal reported after the close on Wednesday, citing people 
familiar with the matter. Part of the probe is considering whether the traders in question tried to boost their profits by 
driving down the prices that the British bonds, known as gilts, were able to achieve in government auctions or by 
artificially raising prices when they were sold on to other investors.
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: M&S Boss Bolland To Retire Amid Poor Christmas Sales
----------
Low-cost airline easyJet said its passenger traffic rose in December but its load factor was dragged lower by the 
effects of the Paris terror attacks, though no such problems were reported by rival Ryanair Holdings, which saw its 
traffic and load factor both improve. easyJet said it carried 4.8 million passengers in December, compared to 4.6 
million a year earlier, up 4.6%. But easyJet said its load factor in the month declined to 86.6% from 88.4%. Irish 
carrier Ryanair, however, said its customer traffic in the month rose 25% year-on-year to 7.5 million, up from 6.0 
million, while its load factor improved to 91.0% from 88.0%.
easyJet also said it will embark on a roadshow with wholesale debt investors, ahead of what could be the budget 
airline's first ever issue of bonds, through the sale of euro medium term notes. The carrier said the roadshow will 
begin on Tuesday next week, with an potential bond programme depending on market conditions.
----------
Persimmon got the trading update season for the housebuilding industry off to a positive start, hailing a year when it 
sold more homes at higher prices and saying its pretax profit is set to rise substantially thanks to the margin 
improvement which accompanied stronger revenue. The housebuilding industry enjoyed a very strong 2015, 
buoyed by a chronic displacement in the supply-demand dynamics of the sector. With housing supply now 
substantially outstripped by buyer demand and a number of policies put in place by first the coalition government 
and now the Conservatives to drive up home ownership, prices have been pushed higher and have not risen to the 
point where demand has been hampered.
----------
BP late on Wednesday said it has agreed to sell its petrochemical complex in Decatur, in the US state of Alabama, 
to Thai petrochemicals group Indorama Ventures. BP said the sale will allow it to focus on its own technologies 
within its petrochemicals business, including the production of purified terephthalic acid, which is used in 
manufacturing polyester. Indorama will buy the complex, including working capital and related infrastructure, and 
will assume contracts currently in place with suppliers and customers. No financial details were disclosed. BP also 
is set to spend USD200.0 million upgrading its Cooper River plant and its sister facility in Geel in Belgium, the 
largest PTA-producing sites in the Americas and Europe, respectively.
----------
Poundland Group said it expects its pretax profit for the year to March to be at the lower-end of market 
expectations, as some of the sluggish trading seen in the first half of its current financial year continued into the 
third quarter. The single-price retailer said total sales in the third quarter, covering the 13 weeks to December 27, 
rose 29%, with revenue growth coming from its current Poundland stores but with the majority of this attributable to 
the 99p Stores outlets added to its estate following the acquisition of its rival last year. Of constant-currency sales 
growth of 30%, excluding Spain, 99p Stores contributed 21 points, while 99p Stores converted into Poundland 
stores added a further 3 points.
----------
Property developer Great Portland Estates said it has swapped two London buildings with German property group 
Deka Immobilien Investment GmbH, including one currently occupied by financial news and information company 
Bloomberg. The FTSE 250-listed company said it has sold 33 Margaret Street in central London to Deka for 
GBP216.3 million. In a separate transaction, Great Portland bought 50 Finsbury Square in the City of London for 
GBP119.0 million from Deka. The building offers 126,500 square feet of office space and is currently let to

Centamin said production for 2016 from its Sukari gold mine in Egypt is forecast to be higher than levels seen in 
2015. In a statement, the gold miner said it expects 2016 production from Sukari to amount to 470,000 ounces at a 
cash operating cost of USD680 per ounce and all-in-sustaining cost of USD900 per ounce. Centamin said that 
would equate to a 7.0% increase on 2015 production and a reduction on 2015 cost guidance of USD700 per ounce

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK house prices increased at a faster than expected pace in December, data published by Lloyds Banking Group's 
Halifax division showed. House prices climbed 1.7% in December from November when they remained flat. 
Economists had forecast only 0.5% rise. On a yearly basis, house prices advanced 9.5% in the quarter ended 
December compared to a 9% rise in three months to November. The annual growth was expected to remain at 9%. 
----------
UK car sales hit a record-high in 2015 on improving consumer confidence and attractive finance deals, the Society 
of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. Car registrations rose 6.3% to 2.63 million units, exceeding forecast and 
outperforming the last record year in 2003 when 2.57 million new cars left the showrooms. This was only the fourth 
time that the UK market has surpassed 2.5 million vehicle sales in a full year, the agency said.
----------
Trading was halted for the day on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges after a steep drop in prices 
triggered an automatic "circuit breaker" for the second time this week. Prices on the CSI 300 Index plummeted 
more than 7% in the first 30 minutes of trading following a further devaluation of the Chinese currency, the yuan, 
which hit its weakest level in nearly five years, official data showed. The CSI 300 comprises the 300 largest firms 
listed on the mainland.
----------
Many policy makers were reluctant to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, according to the 
minutes of the December 15-16 Federal Reserve meeting. It was a "close call" for some officials, but ultimately the 
FOMC voted unanimously to hike interest rates from zero. As expected, there was "significant concern about still-
low readings on actual inflation and the uncertainty and risks present in the inflation outlook." Collapsing energy 
prices have kept inflation in check, but Fed members predicted these effects will prove temporary.
----------
The World Bank trimmed its global growth outlook, citing anemic recovery in major emerging markets, although it 
suggested that overall growth will improve from last year, underpinned by advanced economies. Global economic 
growth is forecast to be 2.9% this year, instead of the 3.3% projected in June, the Washington-based lender said in 
its bi-annual Global Economic Prospects. At an estimated 2.4%, global growth was weaker than expected in 2015 
due to falling commodity prices, flagging trade and capital flows and episodes of financial volatility.

Germany's retail sales rose less-than-expected in November as the pace of growth slowed for a second straight 
month, preliminary data from Destatis showed. Retail sales grew 2.3% year-on-year following a 2.5% gain in 
October, revised from 2.1%. Economists had forecast 3.7% increase.
----------
Germany's factory orders grew more than expected in November despite a fall in demand from the euro area, 
provisional data from Destatis revealed. Manufacturing new orders grew 1.5% in November from the prior month, 
bigger than an expected growth of 0.1%. Nonetheless, monthly growth eased from October's revised 1.7% 
increase.

The US said it had an "ironclad commitment" to the defence of South Korea, and both countries threatened North 
Korea with consequences after Pyongyang said it had carried out its fourth nuclear test. "Any such test...is both a 
flagrant violation of international law and a threat to the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the entire 
Asia-Pacific region," US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and his South Korean counterpart Han Min Koo said 
after speaking by phone. The US guarantees South Korea's security under its nuclear umbrella, and has 28,500 
soldiers stationed in the country.
----------
US Congress took another stab rolling back President Barack Obama's namesake healthcare programme, sending 
legislation to repeal the so-called Obamacare to the president's desk. Conservative Republicans, who hold 
majorities in both the Senate and the lower House of Representatives, have tried many other ways to kill the 
ground-breaking 2010 healthcare law, but this is the first time opposition legislators have sent a repeal to the 
president's desk. The measure, which Obama has vowed to veto, would repeal most of the officially named 
Affordable Care Act and strip federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a women's health care provider.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airline easyJet PLC on Thursday said its passenger traffic rose in December 
but its load factor was dragged lower by the effects of the Paris terror attacks, though no such problems were 
reported by rival Ryanair Holdings PLC, which saw its traffic and load factor both improve.
FTSE 100-listed budget carrier easyJet said it carried 4.8 million passengers in December, compared to 4.6 million 
a year earlier, up 4.6%. On a rolling 12-month basis, passenger numbers were up 6.9% to 69.8 million, it said.
But easyJet said its load factor in the month declined to 86.6% from 88.4%, which it blamed on customers staying 
away following the terrorist attacks which hit Paris in November. It said this is now recovering to more normal levels.
Irish carrier Ryanair, however, said its customer traffic in the month rose 25% year-on-year to 7.5 million, up from 
6.0 million, while its load factor improved to 91.0% from 88.0%.
In addition, its rolling annual traffic to December increased 17% year-on-year to 101.4 million customers.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday said it will open a new base at Belfast International 
Airport, a destination the Irish carrier hasn't offered to this point.
Beginning in March, the base will have one aircraft running a four-times daily service to London Gatwick. The base 
will grow to three aircraft with five more routes to be added from October, delivering over one million new customers 
a year and supporting 750 on-site jobs at the airport.
The Irish low-cost airline said it will invest USD100 million into each aircraft.
Earlier on Thursday, Ryanair said its customer traffic in December rose 25% year-on-year to 7.5 million, up from 6.0 
million, while its load factor improved to 91.0% from 88.0%.
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 4.0% at 14.72 pence on Thursday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Nomura said Ryanair Holding's strategy and macro economic conditions in key markets 
could see the Irish budget carrier beat the Japanese bank's forecasts for net income. 
Nomura analysts said Ryanair has delivered exceptional load factor expansion over the past 20 months, benefiting 
from a strategic shift in its sales strategy. The company has also been supported by industry capacity growth, and 
solid underlying macro conditions in core markets such as the UK and Ireland, as well as recovering demand trends 
in Italy and Spain. 
"We expect the supply/demand balance to remain supportive of further net income growth in FY17 (31 March year 
end), assisted by a substantial fuel costs tailwind," Nomura said. 
After running a scenario analysis, in which it assumed flat revenue in financial year 2017, a load factor expansion of 
100 basis points and using current fuel spot rates and an ex-fuel unit cost, the bank found the company could 
achieve a net income of EUR1.98 billion in financial year 2017. 
This is significantly ahead of Nomura's current estimate of EUR1.54 billion which in itself is already 10% ahead of 
consensus. 
"The delivery of EUR2 billion net income in FY17 is no mean feat, although we regard it as the type of challenge 
that Ryanair is capable of achieving, while acting as a major target for the CEO who is intent on seemingly sticking 
around for the long term," Nomura said. 
The bank said the current valuation of 13 times Nomura's financial year 2017 price-earnings estimate is a strong 
entry point. 
Nomura reiterated its Buy rating and EUR17.00 price target on the stock. Ryanair traded up 0.5% at EUR14.94 on 
Tuesday afternoon.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings said it saw traffic growth hit 70% at Cork, Dublin, Knock and Shannon airports 
in Ireland in 2015 from a year before. The company said the growth has tracked the rise in traffic in the Irish air 
travel industry since the decision in April 2014 by the country to scrap air travel tax.
----------
Dairy Crest Group said it has completed the sale of its Dairies operations to Muller UK & Ireland Group. The dairy 
producer will now be focused on its cheese and spreads business and has said it will be pushing into the infant 
formula market. Muller will pay GBP80.0 million for the assets.
----------
ZincOx Resources said it will start cutting costs and jobs across the business in order to shore up its financial 
position after it failed to raise the funds required under its agreement with Korea Zinc. The company struck a deal 
with Korea Zinc in November to reschedule the USD57.1 million in debt ZincOx owes to Korea Zinc, but this was 
dependent on ZincOx raising USD5.0 million by the end of 2015. Despite "intensive efforts" ZincOx said had been 
made in recent weeks to raise the funds before the end of the year, it has not been able to secure a sufficient 
number of investors to fund this amount. Under the terms of the agreement with Korea Zinc, ZincOx is now 
obligated to transfer 90% of its interest in its ZincOx Korea subsidiary, the owner of its Korean recycling plant 
operation, to Korea Zinc.

88 Energy said the Icewine 1 well in Alaska was drilled to its target depth and that it met all primary unconventional 
drilling objectives, along with robust conventional finds. The company said oil shows were recorded in the drill hole, 
along with good heavy gas and shale gas shows.

Xtract Resources said two employees were killed at its gold processing plant at the Chepica gold and copper mine 
in Chile on Thursday last week, resulting in all work at the mine stopping. Xtract said the local Inspector of Mines 
has concluded no workers were negligent, and no health and safety standards or procedures were contravened. It 
said underground mining will be allowed to resume on Tuesday, though the processing plant is expected to remain 
closed until January 12. The group said despite the temporary shutdown of the plant after the accident, it remains 
on course to meet its financial targets for the quarter to the end of December. Xtract said it will provide an update in 
coming weeks.
----------
German lender Deutsche Bank said it has agreed to sell its entire 19.99% stake in Hua Xia Bank to China's PICC 
Property & Casualty for between CNY23.0 billion and CNY25.7 billion, subject to final price adjustment at closing. 
The total consideration is equal to about EUR3.2 billion to EUR3.7 billion, based on current exchange rates.
----------
MARKETS
----------
UK share prices were trading broadly higher late morning Tuesday, after oil prices stabilised following declines on 
Monday. Gold however slumped in morning trade Tuesday. Stock indices in the US were pointed 0.5% to 0.6% 
higher for the New York open.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The insurance industry is set to face a significant bill from the flooding that has devastated large swathes of 
northern England, according to two estimates of the damage, amid concerns that a new storm could bring further 
problems for the region. KPMG warned the economic impact of the flooding which hit parts of the UK following 
Storms Desmond and Eva over the course of December could be nearly GBP6.0 billion, with insurance claims for 
the flooding estimated to hit around GBP1.5 billion. PwC said it estimated the economic loss from the floods could 
be between GBP900.0 million and GBP1.3 billion, with insurers bearing up to GBP1.0 billion of that.
----------
More worries have been raised that Storm Frank, due to sweep into the UK on Tuesday evening, will cause more 
damage. Nine severe flood warnings are currently in place in England and Wales, mostly centred on York, which 
was badly hit by flooding on Saturday. David Cameron, the UK Prime Minister, defended the government's policy 
on flood defence spending, and Rory Stewart, the floods minister, told the BBC's Today programme on Tuesday the 
government would be open to an external review of its programme being held. The Environment Agency on 
Monday said the UK would need a "complete rethink" of flood defences following the flooding in recent weeks, 
which has resulted in swathes of Cumbria, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire facing severe flooding.
----------
Two people have been arrested after Belgian investigators uncovered plans for terrorist attacks that would target 
landmarks in the capital Brussels during the New Year's festivities, prosecutors said. A series of police searches 
carried out in Brussels, the Flemish Brabant region and near the eastern city of Liege have brought to light "serious 
threats of attacks that would target several emblematic sites of Brussels and would be perpetrated during the year-
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Insurers Face Flood Bill As UK Braces For New Storm
end celebrations," the prosecutors said in a statement. No weapons or explosives were found during the searches, 
but police recovered propaganda material from the Islamic State extremist group and military-type training clothes.
----------
Iraq claimed a major victory Monday over Islamic State militants as troops raised the country's flag over 
government buildings in the centre of Ramadi, capital of the flashpoint western province of Anbar. The recapture of 
Ramadi, which fell to the Islamic State organization in May, is the most significant advance by government forces 
since retaking the northern city of Tikrit at the end of March. The US confirmed that Iraqi security forces had 
secured the government centre complex in Ramadi, but Secretary of State John Kerry said the city was "not yet 
fully secure."
----------
Saudi Arabia unveiled its budget for 2016 with a projected deficit of SAR326 billion (USD87 billion), as the oil-rich 
kingdom has been hard hit by low global commodity prices. Government spending for the next year was expected 
at SAR840 billion, according to data unveiled at a press conference Monday. The budget is the first under King 
Salman, who took over at the helm of the monarchy in January. He has stressed spending on social services and 
infrastructure projects would remain strong.
----------
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel ordered changes in how local police are trained to handle calls involving people 
who may have mental problems after two people died on the weekend in the latest shooting involving the city's 
embattled police department. The case is the latest in a series of highly publicized shootings of African-Americans 
by police in the US, since the August 2014 death of unarmed suspect Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. On 
Monday, a grand jury in Cleveland, Ohio, declined to indict two officers in the November 2014 shooting death of a 
12-year-old boy, who was playing in a park with an air pistol that police mistook for a real firearm. In Chicago, the 
latest shooting occurred 4:30 am Saturday when police responding to a reported domestic disturbance were met by 
a "combative subject," according to a Chicago Police Department statement quoted by local media.

The company said the growth has tracked the rise in traffic in the Irish air travel industry since the decision in April

"Before the various tourism bodies claim undue credit for a record year for Irish tourism, Ryanair is pleased to 
release its 2015 Irish traffic numbers, which show that Ryanair on its own delivered 70% of the growth at the main 
Irish airports this year, thanks to the government's decision to scrap the air travel tax," said Robin Kiely, Ryanair's 
head of communications.
"After five years of decline at Irish airports, the welcome repeal of the air travel tax has resulted in record traffic and 
tourism growth, demonstrating to our counterparts in the UK and Germany the enormous economic benefits 
removing APD brings," Kiely added.
Shares in Ryanair were up 0.8% to EUR15.13 on Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Probes being conducted into the use of agency pilots by Irish budget carrier Ryanair 
Holdings PLC are intensifying in Europe as the UK seeks payment of GBP47.0 million in allegedly unpaid taxes and 
social insurance from Brookfield Aviation, The Sunday Times reported.
Brookfield, the largest supplier of pilots to Ryanair, has seen its owners accused in a court in Germany of "an 
especially serious case of tax evasion". German authorities claim Brookfield was responsible for processing the 
monthly pay for 1,600 pilots and around 300 Irish companies administered by trustees.
According to Wolfgang Bohnen, a prosecutor in Koblenz in Germany, where the case against Brookfield has been 
filed, these companies "mainly serve to conceal an employment relationship with Ryanair".

GENEVA (Alliance News) - The aviation industry is booming again thanks to cheaper oil after years of difficulties, 
the world airline association IATA said in Geneva on Thursday.
Airlines could expect profits like never before this year and next, IATA chief executive Tony Tyler announced as he 
increased his previous profit forecast for the sector for 2015 to 33 billion dollars from 29.3 billion dollars.
That figure would be almost twice as much as was recorded in 2014.
Next year, aviation industry profit is expected to rise to 36.3 billion dollars.
"After years of destruction of our capital, we can finally provide a minimum level of profitability which an investor 
would expect," Tyler said.
Oil prices have been plunging for the last year and a half.
It even looks better for airlines in the previously difficult market of Europe. Companies such as Lufthansa, Air 
France-KLM and Ryanair are expected to reach a total profit of 6.9 billion dollars this year, IATA estimated.
That would be 1.1 billion more than last thought while 2016 should see a 8.6 billion dollar profit.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Investec reiterated its Buy rating on Ryanair Holdings and reckons the budget airline 
will be a "structural winner" for striking the right balance between volume growth and cost containment. 
The broker also raised its price target to EUR17.00 from EUR16.00. Shares were down 0.1% at EUR14.28 on 
Friday.
Ryanair on Thursday saw customer numbers rise 21% to 7.71 million in November, compared to 6.35 million a year 
before. It reported a five-percentage-point rise in load factor to 93% from 88% in the previous year.
The airline attributed its customer growth to lower fares, stronger forward bookings, and its 'Always Getting Better' 
customer experience programme. 
Investec said Ryanair continues to show the strength of its strategic shift supported by a continued focus on cost 
discipline. The broker was also impressed with Ryanair's diverse network structure following the airline's move into 
primary airports across Europe.  
"Ryanair continues to demonstrate the strength of its strategic repositioning with its most recent half year results 
striking the right balance between volume growth and cost containment," said Investec analyst Robert Murphy.
Investec argued that Ryanair could capitalise on its increased network exposure in order to obtain growth. 
"Importantly, this primary growth has been achieved while maintaining a presence at secondary airfields, a network 
characteristic that we view as providing both cost and revenue advantages for the carrier," the analyst noted.
Targeting urbanised catchment areas where the airline already has an established presence in secondary smaller 
airports, would be beneficial for Ryanair, the broker said. By operating in both primary and secondary airports 
Ryanair could extract increased bargaining power with primary airports regarding landing and handling related 
charges.

The carrier could also capitalise on its existing brand presence, which would provide synergies emanating from 
marketing and distribution-related charges, according to Investec. In addition, by serving both the primary and 
secondary airports of a catchment area, Ryanair could more easily adapt the domestic and international component 
of its traffic between the two airfields.
"In doing so the carrier can tailor its services and schedules and the primary airfield to suit the corporate traveller, 
e.g. high frequency domestic routes, while maintaining a leisure-orientated international network from the 
secondary airfield," Murphy said.

PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets are poised for a lower open on Thursday, after weak cues from 
Asia and Wall Street overnight, ahead of the key interest rate decision from the European Central Bank which is 
expected to expand its quantitative easing program.
The European Central Bank will announce its interest rate decision at 7:45 am ET. The bank is forecast to cut its 
deposit rate to -0.3% from -0.2%. The key refi rate is expected to be kept unchanged at a record low 0.05% and the 
marginal lending rate at 0.30%.
Following the announcement, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will hold the customary post-meeting 
press conference at 8:30 am ET.
Services and composite PMI reports from major European economies for November and Eurozone retail trade data 
for October are due later in the day.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the nation's exports were down 3.0% on month in 
October to AUD26.594 billion. The imports were roughly flat at AUD29.900 billion.
Meanwhile, data from Caixin showed that the services sector in China continued to expand in November, albeit at a 
slower rate, with a PMI score of 51.2. That's down from 52.0 in October.
The DAX futures were falling 34.50 points, the CAC 40 futures dropped 13.50 points and the FTSE 100 futures 
declined 20.00 points and the Swiss Market Index futures retreated 60.00 points.
The European markets closed mixed on Wednesday. The DAX fell 0.6% and the CAC 40 dropped 0.2%, while the 
FTSE 100 index and the Swiss Market index gained 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.
On the corporate front, Barclays has agreed to sell its Italian Retail Banking network of 89 branches, including a 
broadly balanced portfolio of assets and liabilities, to CheBanca!, a member of the Mediobanca Group.
European Markets Tipped To Open Lower Ahead Of ECB Decision
BG Group confirmed that the recommended cash and share offer for the company to be made by Royal Dutch Shell 
has received approval from the Australian Treasurer through the Foreign Investment Review Board.
Irish airline Ryanair (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported that its traffic for the month of November grew 21% to 7.71 million 
customers from last year's 6.35 million customers. Load factor rose 5 percentage points from last year.
Wood Group has agreed to acquire The Infinity Group for an initial consideration of USD150 million. Completion of 
the deal is expected later this year.
Smith (DS) reported lower pre-tax profit for the first half of the year, while revenue grew 6% in constant currency.
The Asian stock markets were mostly trading lower after crude oil prices fell below the USD40 a barrel mark 
overnight and as comments from the US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen suggested that the central bank 
remains on track to raise interest rates later this month.
The US futures indicate a slightly higher open on Wall Street. In the previous session, stocks saw considerable 
weakness, partly due to a sharp drop in the price of crude oil. The Dow slid 0.9%, the Nasdaq fell 0.6% and the 
S&P 500 tumbled 1.1%.
Among commodities, crude for January delivery rose USD0.46 to USD40.40 per barrel, while February gold slid 
USD1.6 to USD1052.2 a troy ounce.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it has started High Court 
proceedings in Ireland against online travel agency eDreams and search engine giant Google, accusing the pair of 
misleading customers.
Ryanair said eDreams and Google were misleading consumers by advertising non-existent Ryanair fares both via 
the eDreams website and through Google searches. It said eDreams has been allowed by Google to use 
misleading sub-domains and a copycat website with identical Ryanair branding to push consumers to the eDreams 
website, where they are purchasing Ryanair tickets at inflated prices.
The airline said it has launched a number of legal cases across Europe against so-called "screenscraper" websites, 
like eDreams, to prevent consumers being deceived in to purchasing tickets at false prices and with hidden 
charges.
Shares in Ryanair were up 0.1% to EUR14.18 on Tuesday.

BERLIN (Alliance News) - Lufthansa reached a deal with a union representing the airline's ground staff on 
Saturday, ending one of several pay and pension disputes that have caused frequent disruptions for travellers this 
year.
A statement from the Verdi union said that the German air carrier's 33,000 ground personnel would receive a lump 
sum payment of 2,250 euros (2,400 dollars) if they worked between April and December 2015.
The employees will also receive a 2.2% pay rise for each of the next two years.
Changes to employees' retirement benefits have also been a key sticking point in the negotiations.
The union said Lufthansa agreed that recent and future hires will receive the same pension scheme as long-time 
employees. However, all employees must now contribute 1% of their salary to their plan while the company will put 
in 5.2%.
Faced with increased competition from rivals such as EasyJet and Ryanair, Lufthansa has been on a drive to 
reduce its costs by cutting jobs and benefits, as well as merging its two lost-cost carriers - Eurowings and 
Germanwings - under the single Eurowings brand.
Lufthansa also faced industrial action from pilots and cabin crew this year. The seven-day cabin crew walk-off 
earlier this month was the longest in the company's history and led to the cancellation of 4,700 flights.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it has concluded five-year pay agreements 
with all 76 of its pilot bases across Europe.
The airline said it has now begun a similar process with its cabin crew, after its two largest bases at Dublin and 
London Stansted airports voted to accept five-year deals incorporating pay increases, improved rosters and 
opportunities for promotion.
"The successful conclusion of these deals means that pilots at all 76 Ryanair bases, and now the cabin crew at 
Ryanair's two largest bases (Dublin and London Stansted), have secured improved pay and condition deals which 
will provide them with increased pay and job security over the next five years. New cabin crew negotiations will now 
commence at all of Ryanair's other cabin crew bases," Ryanair said.
Shares in Ryanair were up 1.3% at EUR14.01 on Wednesday.

Lufthansa Flight Attendants To Start Eight-Day Strike In Frankfurt

BERLIN (Alliance News) - Flight attendants at Lufthansa are to begin their rolling eight-day strike by withdrawing 
crews from 2pm local time at Frankfurt, the German airline's main hub, their union announced.
The union, Ufo, is demanding preservation of retirement benefits that enable many stewards and pursers to retire 
from 55. The strike threatens to pull the airline group back into the red after a quarter where its earnings rose by 
half and it forecast a strong full year.
Instead of holding an all-out strike, Ufo has adopted a rolling strategy, announcing its members will not crew any 
take-offs from Frankfurt for Friday afternoon and evening, whereas crews will work as normal at Lufthansa's 
number-two hub, Munich, through Sunday.
Crews were also pulled Friday at a minor field, Dusseldorf, where Lufthansa operates only a single daily 
international flight and 18 domestic connections.
"All passengers of Lufthansa must assume that their flight might get cancelled at the last minute," Nicoley Baublies, 
leader of Ufo, warned. The short-notice tactic has been adopted by the union to thwart Lufthansa counter-efforts to 
organize skeleton services.
He added the union was no longer open to talks, and would only call off the strike if Lufthansa made a substantial 
offer.
Lufthansa's 19,000 attendants had previously been docile compared to its pilots, who have struck 13 times in a 
similar dispute that is still simmering.
Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spoehr is spearheading a cost-cutting drive to ward off competition from both 
budget lines such as Ryanair and mega-carriers from the Gulf such as Emirates.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Fastjet PLC Wednesday reported a rise in the number of passengers carried in October 
on the same month a year earlier, but its load factor declined.
The low-cost African airline said it carried 73,758 passengers in October, a 23% increase on the 59,830 carried in 
October 2014. Its load factor fell by 11 percentage points however, to 63% from 74%, while capacity grew by 23%.
"The load factor this month has been significantly affected by a change in market demand in Tanzania due to the 
Presidential elections. We expected a downturn in the few days leading to the election and on the day itself. 
However, due to the unusually competitive nature of this year's elections, people tended to suspend travel plans 
until the inauguration. There have been no significant reports of civil unrest in the country and I am pleased to 
report that bookings are beginning to return to expected levels," Chief Executive Ed Winter said in a statement.
Fellow low-cost airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC also released their October traffic 
statistics on Wednesday.
Ryanair said it carried 9.7 million customers in October, up 15% from the 8.4 million it carried a year earlier, while 
its load factor improved to 94% from 89%.
Wizz Air said its load factor increased by 1.9 percentage points to 88.2% from 86.3%, while the number of 
passengers carried rose 23% to 1.7 million from 1.4 million.
Shares in fastjet were trading down 5.2% at 69.90 pence on Wednesday morning, while Ryanair shares were up 
0.9% at EUR14.63 and Wizz Air shares were down 4.2% at 1,850.00p.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it expects its full-year net 
profit to be at the top end of its expectations, as it raised its passenger traffic target following increases in revenue, 
post-tax profit and customer numbers in the first half.
Ryanair said after-tax profit for the half year to the end of September was EUR1.09 billion, up from EUR795.00 
billion a year earlier. The profit excludes a one-off gain made from the sale of its stake in Irish flag carrier Aer 
Lingus Group PLC to International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, the owner of British Airways.
Revenue for Ryanair rose to EUR4.04 billion, up from EUR3.54 billion, as total customer traffic in the half rose to 
58.1 million customers from 51.3 million a year earlier. In addition to the rise in customer numbers, the company's 
load factor improved to 93.0%, up 4 percentage points from the year before.
The group also said it has taken advantage of the low fuel prices in the market at present to extend its fuel hedges 
to 95% cover for the 2017 financial year at an average rate of USD62.00 per barrel. Ryanair said the hedging 
extension will save EUR430.0 million in fuel costs in the year to September 2017.
Thanks to the strong performance in the half, Ryanair raised its financial year 2016 traffic target to 105.0 million 
customers, up from 104.0 million previously, based on expectations for higher load factors in the second half and a 
forecast for traffic to grow 17% in the third quarter and by 22% in the fourth quarter.
In line with the upgrade, and as a fall in unit costs and higher ancillary revenue offset an anticipated decline in 
fourth quarter average fares, Ryanair said it now expects its net profit for the full year to the end of March 2016 to 
be at the upper end of its guidance of EUR1.18 billion to EUR1.23 billion. It did caution, however, that this will 
depend on on the strength of bookings in the fourth quarter.

LONDON (Alliance News) - London's main indices opened lower Monday, with several broker downgrades driving 
stocks down, while Hikma Pharmaceuticals was the worst faller after a weaker than expected performance in its 
Generics business.
The FTSE 100 index opened down 0.5% at 6,328.98 points, the FTSE 250 was down 0.1% at 17,108.07, while the 
AIM All-Share was up 0.2% at 739.15.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals, down 5.8%, said trading across the majority of the business has been solid in 2015 but 
said its Generics division is performing below expectations due to slower-than-expected colchicine sales growth.
The company said it has seen continued strong demand for its legacy products within the Generics business, with 
any declines in line with its expectations due to greater competition. But colchicine, its gout treatment, has suffered 
due to Hikma having to sell the drug under both the Mitigare brand name and as an authorised generic version.
This 'hybrid' brand strategy has meant growth in sales of the drug has been "more gradual" than expected, Hikma 
said, and it has cut its revenue guidance in the Generics business to USD150.0 million for the full year, down from 
USD175.0 million to USD200.0 million previous.
Panmure Gordon analyst Mike Mitchell said that "with the lowered expectations for the Generics business, we will 
be reviewing our estimates which are currently broadly in-line with consensus and we expect the market to respond 
to the new lowered guidance."
Shares in Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings were down 1.3% in Dublin, even though it said it expects its full-year 
net profit to be at the top end of its expectations, as it raised its passenger traffic target following increases in 
revenue, post-tax profit and customer numbers in the first half.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Hikma Leads Fallers On Generic Business Weakness
Ryanair said after-tax profit for the half year to the end of September was EUR1.09 billion, up from EUR795.00 
billion a year earlier. The profit excludes a one-off gain made from the sale of its stake in Irish flag carrier Aer 
Lingus Group to International Consolidated Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways.
Thanks to the strong performance in the half, Ryanair raised its financial year 2016 traffic target to 105.0 million 
customers, up from 104.0 million previously, based on expectations for higher load factors in the second half and a 
forecast for traffic to grow 17% in the third quarter and by 22% in the fourth quarter.
"This is a strong first half update, although the weaker recent pricing expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016 may 
cause some concern and, as per other airlines' results last week, the outlook is marginally softer than the reported 
figures," said Nomura. "We retain a more cautious view into higher winter capacity from the market leaders. 
However, market demand and improving macroeconomic conditions support both our Buy rating on Ryanair and 
Bullish sector stance."
FTSE 100-listed airlines EasyJet and International Consolidated Airlines Group were down 3.3% and 2.3%, 
respectively, after HSBC cut its recommendation in the carriers. The bank cut easyJet to Reduce from Hold, while it 
downgraded IAG to Hold from Buy.  
Meanwhile, shares in housebuilder Barratt Developments were also sold, down 1.6%, after being downgraded to 
Neutral from Overweight by JPMorgan Cazenove. The broker also cut fellow blue-chip housebuilder Persimmon to 
Underweight from Neutral, sending the stock down 1.5%.
Compass Group was down 1.5% after Credit Suisse cut the catering and outsourcing company to Underperform 
from Neutral.
In Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.6% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was down 0.5%.
In the economic calendar, Markit manufacturing PMI readings are due from France at 0850 GMT, Germany at 0855 
GMT, the eurozone at 0900 GMT, the UK at 0930 GMT, and the US at 1445 GMT. There also is the Institute for 
Supply Management manufacturing PMI at 1500 GMT, alongside US construction spending.
Rhys Herbert, senior economist at Lloyds Bank said that, with world trade sluggish, the manufacturing sector seems 
to be under pressure everywhere.
"The 'flash' indicators, however, suggested that manufacturing activity in the euro area was relatively resilient in 
October and the final figures are expected to confirm this picture," noted the Herbert. "In the UK, the slowdown 
looks more abrupt... Consequently, we look for another fall in the headline index to 50.7".
According to FXStreet.com, economists look for the UK manufacturing PMI to come in at 51.3, after a previous 
reading of 51.5 in September.
Meanwhile, China's manufacturing sector continued to contract in October, survey results published by Caixin and 
Markit Economics showed Monday. The manufacturing PMI rose to 48.3 in October from 47.2 in September, but it 
came in below expectations of 50, the pivot between expansion and contraction.
Total new business decreased only moderately on the back of an increase in new export orders for the first time 
since June. Consequently, output and employment shrank at slower pace in October. Meanwhile, purchasing 
activity and inventories of inputs continued to fall amid reports of lower production requirements.
CMC Market analyst Michael Hewson highlighted that the reading is still well below the level seen on the same 
month last year of 50.8, and that it showed a third consecutive monthly contraction.
On Sunday, the official manufacturing PMI, released by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, 
remained unchanged at 49.8 in October. At the same time, official data also showed the non-manufacturing PMI 
slid to 53.1 in October from 53.4 in September.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UK share prices are set to start November lower, leaving behind a strong October, with 
several Purchasing Manager's Index readings from European countries and the US in focus. 
Markit manufacturing PMI readings are due from France at 0850 GMT, Germany at 0855 GMT, the eurozone at

manufacturing PMI at 1500 GMT, alongside US construction spending.
"While the recovery seen in European markets in October remains impressive, we still remain well below the peaks 
seen in August just prior to the steep sell-off...while concerns remain over the health of the Chinese and broader 
European economic activity," says CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson. 
"On the evidence seen thus far these measures have failed to have the desired effect, with the latest October 
official manufacturing PMI numbers released over the weekend showing a slight contraction in manufacturing 
activity of 49.8, still well below the level seen this time last year of 50.8, and the third monthly contraction in a row," 
adds Hewson.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index to open lower at 6,326.90 points. The index closed down 0.5% Friday

LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Stocks To Start November Down, PMIs In Focus
Already out Monday, HSBC Holdings reported higher third-quarter pretax profit, and offered reassurance over its 
Asian credit quality amid fears about China's economic slowdown and market volatility in the region.
Pretax profit rose to USD6.10 billion in the three months to September 30, from a USD4.61 billion pretax profit in 
the corresponding quarter the prior year. Adjusted for currency translation and significant items, pretax profit was 
down to USD5.51 billion from USD6.42 billion.
Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings said it expects its full-year net profit to be at the top end of its expectations, as 
it raised its passenger traffic target following increases in revenue, post-tax profit and customer numbers in the first 
half.
Ryanair said after-tax profit for the half year to the end of September was EUR1.09 billion, up from EUR795.00

PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets were mostly higher on Monday, after final data published by Markit 
showed that Eurozone manufacturing activity growth exceeded initial estimate in October.
The Purchasing Managers' Index for the manufacturing sector rose to 52.3 in October from 52 in September. The 
reading was above the flash score of 52.
Meanwhile, China's official manufacturing PMI came in unchanged at 49.8 in October and growth in the country's 
services sector slowed to its lowest level in seven years, while a private reading on the country's manufacturing 
sector contracted for an eighth straight month.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks and the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major 
UK companies, were in positive territory.
The German DAX was moderately higher, while the French CAC 40 made modest gains. Switzerland's SMI rose 
marginally, while The FTSE 100 index of the UK fell about 0.4%.
In Frankfurt, Commerzbank climbed 5.5% after reporting third-quarter results.
RWE rose about 2% while E.ON was modestly higher.
Meanwhile, Deutsche Boerse fell 1%. Merck, Beiersdorf and K+S fell moderately.
In Paris, Renault gained 2.4% while Peugeot advanced fractionally.
Credit Agricole advanced 2%, while Societe Generale rose 0.6%. BNP Paribas was marginally lower.
Vivendi, Technip and Total fell between 0.6% and 0.7%.

In London, Anglo American dropped 2.5%. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto dropped 1.1% each. Randgold Resources fell 
1.8%.
HSBC, which reported third-quarter results, fell 1.1%.
Ryanair was moderately lower, even as the Irish airline reported significant growth in its first-half profit.
The Asian stocks fell broadly after a slew of Chinese data underscored persisting weakness in the world's second-
largest economy.
In the US, futures point to a cautious open on Wall Street. The major US averages slid around half a percent each 
on Friday in the wake of mixed earnings and disappointing data on consumer sentiment, personal income and 
spending. However, US stocks ended October with their biggest monthly gain in four years on optimism about the 
economy.
Crude for December delivery fell USD0.77 to USD45.82 per barrel, while December gold fell USD4.5 to USD1136.9 
a troy ounce.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair PLC and International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, are close to signing a 
collaboration agreement, The Times reported late Friday.
IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh revealed that meetings had taken place with Ryanair executives to come to an 
agreement whereby the budget airline’s extensive European network would feed passengers into Aer Lingus’s 
transatlantic services out of Dublin, the newspaper reported.
IAG, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, acquired Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus this year, with Ryanair's 
agreement in August to sell to IAG its own 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus being the final piece of the puzzle that got the 
deal done.
According to The Times, Walsh said that the talks had identified commercial possibilities in connecting Ryanair's 
flights between Poland and Ireland and offering travellers connections to fly to seven locations to which Aer Lingus 
flies in North America. At present, Ryanair does not interline, as such an arrangement is know, with any carrier, the 
paper said.
http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/transport/article4601062.ece

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group SA guided to slightly higher operating profit 
for the full year on Friday, following on from approving the first dividend since its creation in 2011, but shares in the 
carrier fell as analysts said the upgrade to guidance only brought it in line with market consensus.
IAG's financial performance has been rapidly improving this year, turning to its first operating profit in the first 
quarter and continuing that performance since. The first quarter profit was the most impressive, given airlines 
typically make little or no profit over the slower winter months and book the majority of their earnings in the summer, 
when traveller demand hits a peak.
In the first half of 2015, the strong performance continued, with IAG's operating profit nearly doubling thanks 
primarily to continued robust results from British Airways but also big reductions in the losses made by Iberia, the 
Spanish flag carrier, and Vueling, Iberia's low-cost carrier.
On Friday, IAG said its operating profit in the third quarter to the end of September was EUR1.25 billion, up from 
EUR900.0 million a year earlier and still up to EUR1.21 billion when excluding the contribution from Aer Lingus 
Group PLC, the Irish flag carrier IAG acquired this year.
For the nine months to the end of September, operating profit for the group was up to EUR1.77 billion from 
EUR1.05 billion a year earlier, a 69% rise. The improving results prompted IAG's board on Thursday to approve the 
payment of an interim dividend, the first since the company was created in 2011.
The strong results in the quarter meant IAG has upgraded its operating profit guidance for the full year to EUR2.25 
billion to EUR2.30 billion, a firmer target than the previous guidance for profit to be in excess of EUR2.20 billion. 
The new guidance also excludes any contribution from Aer Lingus.
The upgrade to the guidance, however, was not enough to impress Cantor Fitzgerald, which kept a Sell 
recommendation on IAG and said the guidance uptick only brought it in line with consensus expectations. "Despite 
IN DEPTH: IAG Lifts Guidance, Plans Payout But Market Not Impressed
these solid results and the maiden dividend announced yesterday, we think that IAG is up-with-events," added 
Cantor. 
Markets appear to be in agreement with Cantor, with IAG shares down 3.9% to 574.42 pence on Friday, the worst 
performer in the FTSE 100. 
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo acknowledged markets may react negatively to the only minor improvement to the 
operating profit guidance, but the broker still favours IAG given its "superior margins, return on invested capital and 
strategic positioning", all of which warrant a premium rating.
Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, disagreed with Cantor on the valution question, 
saying IAG shares currently look more favourably priced than those of either Ryanair Holdings PLC or easyJet PLC. 
He said the share price dip on Friday should provide an opportunity for investors to buy.
Aer Lingus made an operating profit of EUR45.0 million for IAG since it joined the group in August. IAG spent the 
majority of its time in the first half wrapping up a deal to buy Aer Lingus, having to navigate its way through 
negotiations with the Irish government and Ryanair, the Irish budget carrier, having fairly quickly secured the 
support of Aer Lingus' board for the EUR1.4 billion takeover.
The Irish government gave its blessing to the deal in May, after IAG made commitments on keeping Aer Lingus' 
existing slots at Heathrow and on continuing to operate daily winter and summer scheduled flights between 
Heathrow and Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports for at least seven years after the acquisition.
Ryanair, however, held out for much longer, eventually only voting to accept the offer in August. 
Ryanair's history with Aer Lingus had been tumultuous, with Ryanair having previously attempted to buy the carrier 
three times and having vehemently battled the UK's Competition and Markets Authority over its ruling that Ryanair 
had to sell down its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus to 5.0%. Ryanair had built up the stake ahead of its attempts to buy 
Aer Lingus and claimed IAG's bid for the Irish carrier had undermined the CMA's view that Ryanair's stake would 
deter any potential bidders.
IAG's key traffic measure, available seat kilometres, also increased in the first nine months of the year, up to 203.38 
billion from 190.23 billion a year earlier. Its passenger load factor for the first nine months also improved to 81.7% 
from 80.7%. Passenger unit revenue rose for the carrier, up to 7.50 euro cents from 7.06 euro cents.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Wednesday said it will open a new base at Corfu from next April, 
its fourth in Greece.
The new base will include one based aircraft at a total investment of USD100 million, 11 new routes to Birmingham, 
Bratislava, Budapest, Cologne, Rome, Katowice, Poznan, Pisa, Rzeszow, Venice and Warsaw, as well as more 
flights to Brussels Charleroi, East Midlands, London Stansted and Milan Bergamo.
It will deliver 300,000 customers per year and support 225 on-site jobs as it doubles its Corfu traffic, the low-cost 
airline said.
"Greece is a significant growth market for Ryanair, and we will continue to connect our Greek airports with Europe's 
major cities such as Brussels, London and Milan, making Ryanair the ideal choice for business and leisure 
customers," Chief Commercial Officer David O'Brien said in a statement.
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 0.2% at EUR12.87 Wednesday morning.

Rises

LONDON (Alliance News) - WH Smith PLC is expected by analysts to post a rise in pretax profit when it releases its 
full-year results on Thursday, as well as announcing a GBP50 million share buyback and perhaps a rise in its cost 
savings guidance.
The books and stationery retailer said in August that its results for the year ended August 31 would be slightly 
ahead of the current market expectations at that time, after its travel business performed well and its struggling high 
street business met expectations in the second half of the year.
Immediately following that update, Cantor Fitzgerald raised its pretax profit forecast to GBP120.5 million from 
GBP119.5 million. 
Based on the predictions of four brokers compiled by Morningstar, the consensus estimate for WH Smith's full-year 
pretax profit is GBP122.2 million. The retailer recorded a pretax profit of GBP114.0 million in the 2014 financial 
year.
RBC Capital said it sees potential for further consensus earnings upgrades when the retailer reports its results, 
given momentum in like-for-like sales in the travel business and additional cost savings.
The broker said it thinks WH Smith's travel retail business will continue to see an accelerating trend in like-for-likes, 
in particular driven by the airport sector which reflects an improving trend in passenger numbers as recently 
reported by airlines easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC.
RBC added that it sees potential for WH Smith to raise its current 2015-17 cost savings guidance of GBP21 million, 
which it said would reassure investors about the impact of increases resulting from the UK National Living Wage, 
which RBC thinks the retailer can offset through productivity initiatives and rental deflation.
EARNINGS PREVIEW: WH Smith Seen Offering Share Buyback As Profit Rises
Given its "exemplary track record" for returning money to shareholders, RBC said it expects WH Smith to announce 
a further GBP50 million share buyback for financial 2016, noting that it has returned over half its market 
capitalisation to shareholders since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
"We remain positive on WH Smith for travel momentum and further earnings upgrades. We also note that physical 
books have started to outperform ebooks which has historically been the biggest drag on high street like-for-likes," 
RBC said.
Shares in WH Smith were trading up 0.9% at 1,548.00 pence Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
The UK government said it will launch a retail sale of shares in Lloyds Banking Group in the spring of next year, 
continuing its push to return the bank to public ownership. HM Treasury said it is the intention of the government to 
fully exit its shareholding in Lloyds in the coming months, including a GBP2 billion sale of shares to retail investors. 
Members of the public will get a 5% discount on the market price of the shares and will get one bonus share for 
every 10 they hold for more than a year.
----------
Aerospace and engineering group Rolls-Royce Holdings confirmed a press report that it will cut a further 400 jobs in 
its Marine business by the end of 2016. Rolls-Royce said the job cuts, which are being made in addition to the 600 
already announced in the Marine business, were the result of the continued reduced demand for its services and 
products due to the downturn in the oil and gas market.
----------
Insurer Prudential is considering quitting the UK in order to escape more onerous regulation on the sector from the 
European Union, The Sunday Times reported. The radical plan may result in Prudential selling its British operations 
or spinning them off into a separate company, the newspaper said, citing City sources.
----------
Ryanair Holdings, Wizz Air Holdings and Fastjet all posted improved passenger traffic for September, while Fastjet 
also said its chief financial officer will be stepping down next year. Ryanair said its customer traffic in September 
rose 12% year-on-year to 9.6 million from 8.5 million a year earlier, while its load factor improved to 94.0% from

----------
Playtech said it has received a letter from the Central Bank of Ireland opposing its proposed USD105 million deal to 
acquire contracts-for-difference broker Ava Trade. The company said it will be seeking clarification from the Irish 
central bank and will engage with it to discuss some issues raised in the letter which it believes can be addressed to 
the central bank's satisfaction. Elsewhere, Playtech is continuing to work towards securing the one remaining 
regulatory approval it requires for its GBP459 million deal to acquire contracts-for-difference trader Plus500.
----------
Business processing outsourcing company Xchanging confirmed it has received takeover offers from much larger 
rival Capita and US buyout house Apollo Global Management. Xchanging said it received a non-binding takeover 
offer valuing the company at 140 pence per share from Capita back in August, but it rejected this bid. Capita then 
raised that offer to 160 pence per share, and Xchanging said it has now granted Capita due diligence access. 
Capita's bid values the company at GBP396.6 million. Separately, Apollo has made a bid for Xchanging valuing the 
company at 170 pence per share and has also been granted due diligence access. Apollo's bid values the company 
at GBP421.3 million. Capita said it likely would fund the deal, if it progresses, with a share placing.
----------

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK services sector growth slowed unexpectedly in September to the lowest level in nearly two-and-a-half 
years, as growth in new business eased to a 29-month low, survey results from Markit Economics and the 
Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply showed. The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers' index fell to 
53.3 in September from 55.6 in the previous month. Economists had expected the index to increase to 56.3.
----------
Former Labour transport secretary Lord Adonis is to chair a new body which will plan infrastructure projects in the

Conservative Party conference on Monday, the BBC said, and Osborne is due to pledge a further GBP5 billion in 
this parliament to back major schemes.
----------
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Tories Set GBP2 Billion Lloyds Retail Share Offer
The British government is confident of securing a deal to reform the EU and persuade voters to say yes to Britain 
remaining a member, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. Negotiating a deal that will satisfy the Conservative 
government and win a majority in a planned referendum on Britain's EU membership will "require some hard graft 
[work]" and negotiations "will be tough," Hammond said. "But we will secure a deal," he said. "Because our 
European neighbours understand the value Britain adds to the EU, and that keeping us there requires real change."
----------
Eurozone private sector growth slowed more than initially estimated to a four-month low in September, final data 
from Markit showed. The final composite output index fell to 53.6 in September from 54.3 in August. It was also 
below the flash score of 53.9.
----------
Eurozone retail sales remained flat in August after recovering in the prior month, Eurostat reported. Economists had 
forecast sales to fall 0.1% after rising 0.6% in July. The rate for July was revised up from the initial estimate of 
0.4%.
----------
Ireland's service sector growth quickened in September on the back of a strong rise in new orders, survey figures 
from Markit Economics showed. The Investec services purchasing managers' index rose to 62.4 in September from 
62.1 in the previous month. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
----------
UK Prime Minister David Cameron plans to bolster Britain's special forces and buy 20 of the latest US Protector 
drones to use against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Cameron told the Sunday Telegraph that Britain "will be 
more than doubling...our [drone] fleet to keep us safe and to give us the intelligence and information and potentially 
give us the capacity to hit people who are potentially planning to hit us."
----------
Islamic State militants destroyed a famous arch in the ancient city of Palmyra, the Syrian authorities in charge of 
antiquities said. The Arch of Triumph, built in the 2nd century AD, was destroyed on Sunday, the Directorate-
General of Antiquities and Museums said, quoting local witnesses. Palmyra, registered as a UN World Heritage site 
since 1980, fell to the fundamentalist militant group in May.
----------
The World Bank downgraded its growth outlook for developing East Asia, citing China's economic rebalancing and 
the expected pace of normalization of the US interest rates. Developing east Asia will grow 6.5% this year, instead 
of 6.7% estimated in April, the bank said in its East Asia Pacific Economic Update released. The report assumed a 
gradual slowdown of the Chinese economy. The second largest economy is forecast to grow about 7% in 2015. 
China is expected to grow 6.7% in 2016 and by 6.5% in 2017. In April, the lender had estimated 7.1% growth for 
2015 and 7% for 2016.
----------
Talks aimed at finalizing a trade deal between the US and 11 other Pacific Rim countries were extended into the 
weekend, reports said. US Trade Representative Michael Froman and his counterparts working on the Trans-
Pacific Partnership have been meeting since Wednesday last week in the US city of Atlanta. Neither Froman nor his 
office has yet issued an update on the progress of the talks, which are being held behind closed doors.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum has lifted its earnings estimates on Ryanair Holdings and price target on the 
stock to EUR13.50 from EUR12.00, after the budget airline increased its net profit guidance last month. 
The broker upgraded by 24% its financial year 2016 earnings per share estimates after the company last month 
raised its net profit guidance by a quarter. 
Ryanair had said it expects its net profit to come in between EUR1.18 billion and EUR1.23 billion for the financial 
year to the end of March, versus its previously-guided range of EUR940 million to EUR970 million.
As a result, Liberum now expects financial year 2016 EPS to be 91 euro cents from a previous estimate of 73 cents. 
Ryanair reported EPS of 67 cents in financial 2015.
However the broker kept a Hold stance the stock. Liberum said Ryanair has strong fundamentals "that should win 
out over the long term", but it believes the current valuation is up with events, with the shares fairly valued.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.0% at EUR12.96 Thursday, having risen by 33% year to date. 
"We remain concerned about Ryanair’s unit costs. These have been rising on an ex-fuel, per seat basis, which we 
consider to be more appropriate and representative than the per passenger basis Ryanair itself prefers to focus on," 
said Khoo. 
"On [Ryanair's] management’s preferred basis, unit costs fell by 5% last year and were flat excluding fuel. However, 
when measured on a per seat basis, Ryanair’s non-fuel unit costs rose by 6% last year. Moderating this inflation is 
a key challenge that the market assumes will be achieved," added the Liberum analyst.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The Competition and Markets Authority Thursday said Ryanair Holdings PLC has 
withdrawn its final appeal over the requirement to reduce its shareholding in Aer Lingus Group PLC.
Last month, the Irish budget carrier sold its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus to International Consolidated Airlines Group 
SA, which owns British Airways and Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling, following the European Commission's 
decision to clear IAG's takeover bid for Aer Lingus and the granting of necessary approval from the UK Competition 
and Markets Authority.
Ryanair claimed in July that there had been a material change of circumstances since the CMA's original decision 
requiring the airline to reduce its shareholding in Aer Lingus to 5%. Ryanair was typically forthright in its arguments 
to the regulator, calling the CMA's decision "ridiculous" and "manifestly wrong" and saying it "flies in the face" of the 
current IAG takeover offer for Aer Lingus.
IAG made a EUR1.4 billion offer for Aer Lingus, and the deal was dependent on Ryanair accepting the deal. 
Ryanair sought permission from the Court of Appeal to appeal the tribunal's decision, but has now withdrawn that 
application. The appeal was formally dismissed by the Court of Appeal on Thursday. 
"Our decision was that it was bad for competition - and ultimately for passengers - for Ryanair to retain an influence 
over one of its major competitors through its shareholding. With Ryanair having sold its shareholding and withdrawn 
this appeal, we are pleased that the matter is now at an end," said Simon Polito, chairman of the Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus inquiry group appoint by the CMA.
Ryanair shares were down 1.2% to 12.94 pence per share on Thursday, whilst IAG shares were down 1.1% to 
581.50 pence.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Investec believes the value of WH Smith does not reflect its cash generation or growth 
potential as the company is set to benefit from ongoing sector consolidation as well as underlying market growth in 
the travel industry. 
"Valuation reflects neither cash generation (GBP60.0 million per annum surplus post capital expenditure and 
dividend) nor growth potential," said Investec analyst Kate Calvert. 
"A strong second half performance is expected from Travel in particular, if recent Ryanair and EasyJet passenger 
numbers are anything to go by," she added, referring to the company's network of stores based in airports. 
Calvert said Travel will be the focus of the second half, which will also benefit from a recovery in rail journeys 
following years of investment in the industry, boosting its stores in train stations. 
"A recovery in rail is also expected following several years of investment. We are looking for an update on the new 
store pipeline. Management tends to target 20-30 International and 20 UK openings a year," she said. 
Back on the high street, Calvert said the second half is typically weaker than the first as Christmas falls into the first 
half of its financial year. She said she is focused on an update on future cost savings and progress on the 'WH 
Smith Local' franchise initiative. 
Investec has a Buy rating on WH Smith with a 1,820.0 pence price target. 
WH Smith shares were up 0.3% to 1,568.0 pence per share on Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Monday said that the EUR398 million it last week said it will 
distribute to shareholders amounts to EUR0.2942 per share, and that it will consolidate shares on the basis of 39 
new shares for every existing 40 shares.
Last Thursday, the low-cost airline said that it is returning the funds from the proceeds of the sale of its stake in Aer 
Lingus Group PLC, via a B share programme to be concluded before December. 
This will bring the total funds returned to shareholders this year to EUR800 million.
Ryanair agreed to sell its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus to International Consolidated Airlines Group in July.
On Monday it said that in order to try to maintain the market price for shares at approximately the same level as 
immediately prior to the implementation of the return of cash, a capital reorganisation, entailing a share 
consolidation on the basis of 39 new shares for every 40 existing shares, also is being proposed. 
Ryanair added that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting in Dublin on October 22, at which the resolutions 
necessary for the implementation of the return of cash will be voted on. 
Shares in Ryanair closed flat at EUR13.39 on Monday.

IN THE KNOW: Low-Cost Airlines To Post Strongest Peak Summer In 
Decade

LONDON (Alliance News) - After a "bumpy" second quarter, European low-cost airlines are on track to post "one of 
the strongest peak summers of the last decade", according to Barclays.
The bank said that a robust European consumer has supported growth in sales over the summer period and that 
the decline in oil prices is "clear evidence" that yields depend on demand versus supply. 
While strong demand and low oil prices mean that capacity "will inevitably creep upwards", Barclays said that 
earnings momentum can be sustained as on a one-to-two-year view it is physically impossible for the industry to 
add the amount of capacity required to fully offset the benefits of USD50 per barrel of oil.
Most European low-cost airlines have already planned growth rates this winter, according to Barclays, which said it 
expects further additions in 2016.
"For now, we expect any yield pressure at LCCs to be heavily outweighed by fuel benefits as hedges roll off. We 
expect rising margins and ongoing EPS momentum to drive shares, even if multiples derate as capacity is added," 
Barclays said.
The bank noted that Ryanair Holdings continues to deliver an "outstanding financial performance" and assumes 
30% earnings per share growth in the full financial year 2017 as fuel hedges collapse. It said it sees upside to 
winter guidance, mainly driven by volumes, predicting load factor growth of 2 percentage points, fully closing the 
gap with easyJet, although it said potential to beat on pricing is limited given strong capacity growth of 17%.
Barclays added that it expects Ryanair to announce as much as EUR800 million in shareholder returns at its annual 
general meeting on Thursday. The bank has an Overweight rating on Ryanair and hiked its target price to 
EUR16.80 from EUR14.00.
IN THE KNOW: Low-Cost Airlines To Post Strongest Peak Summer In Decade
Meanwhile, the bank said that easyJet has absorbed the most intense competitive environment it has faced for 
many years in financial 2015, while sustaining positive pricing, which it said is testimony to the resilience of its 
revenue model and the UK consumer. 
Into the winter, easyJet will maintain a similar growth rate to the summer at around 7%, Barclays said, and added 
that competitor growth on its routes will moderate versus last year. It has an Overweight rating on easyJet and 
hiked its target price to 2,100 pence from 1,950 pence.
Wizz Air should also be benefiting from the strong demand environment, Barclays said, noting that the company 
has been raising its winter capacity plans while the competitive environment on its network appears to moderate.
The bank said its earnings per share forecast for financial 2016 would increase 10% for Wizz Air if it announces a 
similar pricing upgrade in the third quarter to Ryanair and easyJet. Barclays does not have a recommendation or 
price target on Wizz Air.
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 3.5% at EUR14.02 Wednesday afternoon, while easyJet shares were also up 
3.5% at 1,758.66p, and Wizz Air shares were up 1.2% at 1,850.00p.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UBS lifted Ryanair Holdings price target to EUR15.85 from EUR13.60, keeping a Buy 
stance on the stock, as it also upgraded its forecasts on the budget airline net profit for financial years 2016 and 
2017.
Even though the company lifted its own estimates last week, UBS believes "there is more to go", as the bank thinks 
upside risk remains to guidance. 
Ryanair raised its financial year 2016 net profit guidance by a quarter to between EUR1.18 billion and EUR1.23 
billion, from its previously-guided range of EUR940 million to EUR970 million.
In response, UBS raised its Ryanair net profit estimate for financial 2016 to GBP1.25 billion from GBP1.03 billion, 
and its financial 2017 expectation to GBP1.45 billion from GBP1.19 billion. 
The company reported a net profit of GBP867 million for the year that ended in March 2015.
The company said this was due to stronger-than-expected traffic in the peak summer period as its "Always Getting 
Better" programme brings in new customers at slightly higher air fares. 
UBS said potential for capital returns and share momentum make the Irish budget airline shares "attractive". 
While the broker acknowledged that earnings visibility for Ryanair is low, it said the share price is not reflecting the 
earnings upside and momentum at the budget airline. In the year to date, shares in Ryanair have risen by 39%, 
standing Tuesday at EUR13.65, up 0.6% on the day.
"We are confident that post the AGM meeting, a special dividend or share buyback program will be implemented 
(likely in excess of EUR0.5 billion), which should provide further support for the shares," said UBS.
Ryanair's annual general meeting is scheduled for September 24.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Wednesday said it has raised its full-year profit guidance as it 
delivered stronger-than-expected peak summer traffic and prices.
The Irish low-cost airline said that it has raised its full-year net profit guidance by a quarter to fall between EUR1.18 
billion and EUR1.23 billion, from its previously-guided range of EUR940 million to EUR970 million.
It said this was due to stronger-than-expected traffic in the peak summer period as its "Always Getting Better" 
programme brings in new customers at slightly higher air fares. 
Traffic in the first half of the year grew 13%, Ryanair said, while fares were up over 2%. Traffic growth in the third 
quarter is now expected to be 15%, up from the previously-guided 13%, while third-quarter fares are anticipated to 
be flat, having been expected to fall at between 4% and 8% previously.
Ryanair did warn, however, that it will see downward pressure on fares and yields this winter as it grows in major 
EU markets such as Germany, at a time when competitors will begin to benefit from lower oil prices.
"As a "load factor active/yield passive" airline we have clearly benefited from favourable industry trends this summer 
including bad weather in Northern Europe, stronger sterling encouraging more UK families to holiday in the 
Mediterranean, reasonably flat capacity across the EU industry and lower prices for our unhedged oil," Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement. 
"Being the airline industry we do not expect these favourable conditions will persist, and we would urge 
shareholders and analysts to avoid irrational exuberance while we continue to execute our very ambitious growth 
plans during what we expect to be very attritional and sustained fare wars across Europe this winter," he added.

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - The European markets jumped on Wednesday, tracking firm cues from Asia and Wall 
Street overnight, as investors chose to ignore an unexpected fall in UK industrial and manufacturing output.
The Asian stocks rallied, tracking strong gains in the US and European markets overnight, as positive European 
GDP data and Beijing's relentless efforts to prop up the stock market boosted investors' appetite for riskier assets.
In the US, futures point to a higher open on Wall Street. In the previous session, stocks rose sharply as investors 
returned from a holiday weekend. The Dow rallied 2.4%, the Nasdaq advanced 2.7% and the S&P 500 climbed 
2.5%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks added 2.2%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes 
some major UK companies, rose 2.4%.
The German DAX, the French CAC 40, the FTSE 100 index of the UK and Switzerland's SMI were gaining between 
1.7% and 2.3%.
In Frankfurt, Daimler and BMW climbed 3.2% each, and Volkswagen rose 2.7%. Morgan Stanley raised BMW to 
"Overweight" from "Equalweight." Tire maker Continental was up 2.7%.
HeidelbergCement added 2.7%, and Deutsche Telekom gained around 2%.
Insurer Allianz and specialty chemicals firm Lanxess rose 1.8% each.
In Paris, hotel group Accor climbed around 5%, thus leading the gainers.
Renault jumped 4.5% and Peugeot added 3.5%. Car parts maker Valeo rose around 4%.
LVMH and Airbus gained 3.4% and 3.2%, respectively.

In London, Anglo American climbed 7.1% and Glencore added 5.1%. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto were gaining 5% 
and 4.2%, respectively.
HSBC and Standard Chartered gained around 3% each.
Ryanair climbed around 7% after the Irish airline lifted its forecast for 2016.
Volvo gained 3.2% in Stockholm, following a positive broker recommendation.
Swiss engineering firm ABB lowered its revenue growth target for 2015-2020, reflecting reduced macroeconomic 
expectations. However, the company reaffirmed all other targets for profitability. The stock rose moderately in 
Zurich.
Data released by the Office for National Statistics showed that the UK industrial and manufacturing output dropped 
unexpectedly in July. Industrial output dropped 0.4% on a monthly basis, confounding expectations for a marginal 
growth of 0.1%. Manufacturing output declined 0.8%, while economists had expected it to grow 0.2%.
UK visible trade deficit widened for a second straight month in July to its biggest level in a year, exceeding 
economists' expectations, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed. The deficit in the trade in goods 
rose to 11.082 billion pounds from 8.507 billion pounds in June. Economists had forecast a 9.5 billion pounds 
shortfall.
Crude for October delivery fell USD0.51 to USD45.43 per barrel, while December gold dropped USD1.6 to 
USD1119.4 a troy ounce.

back of the "upbeat and unexpected" trading update, leaving at the top end of consensus forecasts. It said there 
could still be some modest upside risk to profit forecasts, though this is mitigated by there only being September left 
in its financial year and a large proportion of seats likely having already been sold.
Looking to financial 2016 and 2017, Liberum said it is worth noting that it has assumed a jet fuel price of USD600 
per tonne for the unhedged portion of the airline's fuel bill, compared to a current spot price of USD520 per tonne. 
Should fuel prices persist at current or even lower levels, this could provide another upside risk to estimates for 
those years, albeit with a risk that pricing could be eroded.
The broker added easyJet continues to trade at a significant discount to Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings, its closest 
competitor. But it said its 30% discount to financial 2015 multiples and 20% to 2016 seems "excessive" and 
Liberum sees scope for this to narrow.
On the back of the estimates upgrade, Liberum raised its target price on easyJet to 2,040 pence from 1,930p and 
reiterated its Buy rating.
Nomura also upgraded its financial year 2015 pretax profit forecast for easyJet, up 8% to GBP689 million, and 
hiked its financial 2016 estimates by 5% due to the recent strength of the euro against sterling.
The Japanese bank said it is not complacent about the capacity pressure which will hit the European airline market 
in winter 2015-16, though it said it sees limited capacity growth on the key legacy services easyJet still targets for 
market share growth. It also said the leisure-led demand has been strong throughout the summer and the 
macroeconomic outlook supports ongoing demand.
IN THE KNOW: Liberum Still Sees Further Upside For easyJet Profit
On the back of the profit upgrade, Nomura too lifted its target price on easyJet to 2,100 pence from 2,000p, while 
reiterating its Buy rating.
Shares in easyJet were up 0.4% to 1,769.28p on Friday morning, having added 5.7% on Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said its customer traffic and 
load factor both improved in August as it announced the summer 2016 schedule for its flights from London's

"Ryanair's August traffic grew by 10% to 10.4m customers, while our load factor jumped 2% points to 95%. These

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The majority of the European markets ended Wednesday's session to the upside, 
following the sharp declines of the previous session. Concerns over China dominated the headlines yesterday, after 
the nation's manufacturing data came in weaker than expected.
Gains in Europe began to erode in late trade, due to weakness in energy stocks. Crude oil prices accelerated to the 
downside after a US government report showed that US crude oil inventories increased by much more than 
expected.
Early gains were fueled by bargain hunting, following Tuesday's sharp sell-off. US private sector employment data 
was also viewed positively ahead of Friday's jobs report. Investors will now shift their focus to tomorrow's meeting of 
the European Central Bank.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks increased by 0.32%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, added 0.38%.
The DAX of Germany climbed by 0.32% and the CAC 40 of France rose by 0.30%. The FTSE of the UK gained 
0.41% and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.06%.
In Frankfurt, Commercial vehicles maker MAN SE finished up by 0.47%. The company said its board decided to 
apply for cancellation of the listing of the shares in the Prime Standard and transfer to a General Standard listing.
RWE declined by 1.18% and E.ON lost 0.87%.
In Paris, Alstom gained 2.26% on reports that General Electric Co. is poised to win approval in Europe for its 
purchase of the speed-train maker's energy business shortly.
Vivendi rose by 0.25%. The media company reportedly increased its stake in French video platform Dailymotion, 
now controlling 90% of its holding.
European Markets Finished Mostly Higher After Yesterday's Sell-Off
In London, Ashtead Group surged by 7.74%, after reporting first-quarter results.
Ryanair climbed by 3.30%, after reporting growth in traffic and load factor for August.
Glencore sank by 8.01% after the company has opted to pay back USD350 million in bonds next month.
ARM Holdings finished higher by 0.88%. JPMorgan upgraded its rating on the stock to "Neutral" from 
"Underweight."
Merlin Entertainments rose by 1.30%, after UBS upgraded its rating to "Buy" from "Neutral."
Hikma Pharmaceuticals gained 4.36%, after Barclays increased its price target on the stock.
Telefonica dropped by 2.37% in Madrid. RBC Capital downgraded its rating on the stock to "Underperform" from 
"Outperform."
Eurozone's producer prices declined at a stable rate in July, in line with expectations, figures from Eurostat showed 
Wednesday. The producer price index fell 2.1% year-over-year in July, the same rate of decrease as in the previous 
month, revised down from the 2.2% drop reported earlier.
British construction sector sustained its robust growth in August, albeit at a slower pace, with continued boost from 
the housing sector and new impetus from the commercial sector. The seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS UK 
Construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 57.3 from 57.1 in July, survey results from the Chartered Institute 
of Procurement and Supply and Markit Economics revealed Wednesday. Economists had forecast a higher score of 
57.5.
Employment in the US private sector saw a notable increase in the month of August, according to a report released 
by payroll processor ADP on Wednesday, although the pace of job growth fell short of economist estimates.
ADP said private sector employment climbed by 190,000 jobs in August following a downwardly revised increase of 
177,000 jobs in July. Economists had expected employment to jump by about 210,000 jobs compared to the 
increase of 185,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.
Labor productivity in the US jumped by much more than previously estimated in the second quarter, the Labor 
Department revealed in a report on Wednesday.
The report said labor productivity surged up by 3.3% in the second quarter, reflecting a notable upward revision 
from the previously reported 1.3% growth. Economists had expected the pace of growth to be upwardly revised to 
2.8%.

stocks the previous day.
In the US, futures point to a higher open on Wall Street. In the previous session, the major averages lost about 3% 
each to post their third-worst drop this year, as signs of further weakness in China reignited investors' concerns 
about the global economy.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Tuesday said it has launched Ryanair Car Hire through a 
partnership with travel-technology and car rental services aggregator CarTrawler, to allow Ryanair customers to 
book car rentals through its website.
The car hire partnership will give customers access to over 1,500 car rental agents in over 30,000 airport and city 
locations across 174 countries, and is part of Ryanair's "Always Getting Better" programme, the low-cost airline 
said.
Ryanair Car Hire will go live on the Ryanair.com website from September 1.
"Following an extensive tender process, Ryanair is pleased to partner with CarTrawler, who offer the best 
conversion rate in the business, as we launch Ryanair Car Hire, offering the widest range and best value car rental 
service to our 103 million customers," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Back in July, the Irish budget carrier revealed that car rental company Hertz, with which it had a car hire supply 
deal, had sent the company notice that it had terminated the contract. 
Hertz claimed that Ryanair's deal with GDS distribution companies represented a breach of contract, which Ryanair 
disputed given the deal had been in place since April 2014 with, Ryanair claimed, Hertz's knowledge and support.
Ryanair said at the time that it believed the termination of the deal to be in breach of its long-term exclusive contract 
with Hertz, which had recently been extended to 2020. As a result, the carrier said it was planning to pursue Hertz 
for breach of contract and damages.
Shares in Ryanair were trading up 3.3% at 11.78 pence Tuesday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC has lost a test case on flight delays which 
could affect compensation claims made by millions of passengers, the BBC reports.
Manchester County Court ruled the airline cannot cut the time a passenger has to claim for flight delays to two 
years from six currently by adding a clause to its small print. The ruling will set a precedent for delayed passengers 
in the European Union using all airlines, the BBC said.
Ryanair said the six year rule is "unnecessary and unreasonable" and added it will appeal the decision.

IN THE KNOW: Cheap Fuel Keeps Nomura Positive On Airlines' Outlook

LONDON (Alliance News) - Nomura retains its positive view on the European airlines sector on the back of the fuel 
and supply outlook and strong passenger volumes, citing International Consolidated Airlines Group as its top pick.
Nomura says fuel costs account for an average of around 30% of operating expenses in the airline industry and, as 
such, the recent and sustained fall in fuel prices provides a material positive impact on margins for carriers.
The bank says, however, that fuel prices do not directly impact on airlines' pricing methodologies and, while 
demand patterns and pricing can be effected by competitor, it is comfortable that the underlying supply and demand 
conditions for key European airlines support robust yields and, for the stronger players, margin accretion is likely to 
materialise from fuel and internally-generated cost efficiencies.
While Nomura expects low-cost carriers easyJet and Ryanair Holdings to continue to expand aggressively, 
forecasting an average 7% expansion of capacity over the next 12 months, and this will pressure winter yields, the 
bank's analysis of the industry capacity outlook on key routes "implies a generally well-balanced supply situation".
With fleet expansion programmes focusing on short-haul aircraft and sitting mainly with Asian operators, the 
investment-capacity outlook for European players looks moderate, notwithstanding any competitive pressure they 
will face on some routes from fast-expanding Gulf carriers.
The bank has adjusted its forecasts across the sector to reflect new fuel cost assumptions, marginally lower yields 
due to strategic pricing and to take into account the latest foreign exchange spot rates and hedging guidance.
Its top pick in the sector is IAG, the owner of British Airways and Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling and the soon-
to-be owner of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group. Trading at 8.7 times 2016 earnings, Nomura thinks the market is 
missing the remaining cost cutting opportunities IAG offers and the likely expansion of its global alliances, 
supported by a strong position in key European hubs. It keeps a Buy rating on IAG and hikes it target price to 750 
pence from 700p.
IN THE KNOW: Cheap Fuel Keeps Nomura Positive On Airlines' Outlook
The group also keeps a Buy rating on easyJet and a lower-conviction Buy on rival Ryanair. Its price target on 
easyJet rises to 2,000p from 1,950p and its Ryanair target rises to EUR14.00 from EUR12.00.
For easyJet, Nomura thinks markets are failing to recognise the inherent value in the company's "success in driving 
an enviable market and route network position which is difficult to replicate" in addition to "myriad growth 
opportunities" it has on offer. On Ryanair, the lower conviction is driven by the winter yield pressure it is likely to 
face due to its material capacity increase, while some of the target price rise is down to the money the company will 
get from the sale of its stake in Aer Lingus to IAG.
The only downgrade the bank makes is on Eastern Europe-focused budget carrier Wizz Air Holdings, which it cuts 
to Neutral from Buy and raises its target price to 1,750p from 1,700p. While the group still has exceptional growth 
opportunities, Nomura thinks this has been priced in given its 16.6 times 2016 price-earnings multiple is at a 17% 
premium to Ryanair.
IAG shares are up 0.7% to 543.00p, easyjet shares are up 0.5% to 1,706.00p, Ryanair shares are down 1.7% to 
EUR12.60 and Wizz Air shares are down 1.2% to 1,840.00p.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Investec raises its price target for Ryanair Holdings, saying the low-cost airline's 
summer trading was strong, and it is well placed to capture share in the German market. 
Ryanair said its customer numbers rose 11% year-on-year to 10.1 million in July from 9.2 million, while its load 
factor increased to 95% from 91%. It claimed that this was the first time that any airline has carried more than 10 
million international customers in one month.
Investec analyst Robert Murphy says Ryanair has the momentum to close out an already impressive summer, with 
the airline guiding to a 13% year-on-year increase in passenger volumes for its first half between April and 
September. 
Murphy says the company is also well placed to grow during the winter months  given the ample availability of 
aircraft, the ability to pay the market rate for jet fuel and the timely introduction of new cabin interiors.
The analyst also notes that Ryanair is targeting expansion into Germany. Murphy says Germany is the second 
largest commercial aviation market in Europe, after the UK, but despite its mature market status, there remains 
scope for significant low-cost carrier growth.
As part of Ryanair's strategy of moving into more traditional primary airport markets, the carrier has targeted a 
medium term share of 20% of the German market, a significant increase from a current estimated share of around 
5%, the analyst says.
"We view continued restructuring at both Air Berlin and Lufthansa as providing a tailwind," Murphy adds.
Investec reiterates its Buy rating and raises its price target on the stock to EUR14.00 from EUR13.53, saying the 
company deserves its premium rating.
Ryanair trades down 1.6% at EUR12.63 Wednesday morning.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - European stocks are set for a cautious open on Wednesday as investors fret over 
slowing demand for commodities from the world's second-largest economy. While China's yuan held mostly steady 
after last week's shock devaluation, the country's stock market continues to tumble, posing a bigger headache for 
policymakers worried about slowing economic growth.
China's Shanghai Composite index is down over 2% after tumbling more than 6% the previous day. Elsewhere, the 
benchmark indexes in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea are down about 1% each on concerns the deflationary 
pressures of a slowdown in China's economy would sap growth globally.
The safe-haven yen strengthened against the dollar, reflecting concerns about China's economic outlook and data 
showing slowing export growth in the world's third largest economy.
Crude oil prices resumed their slide in Asian deals amid signals OPEC nations will continue pumping crude despite 
a global glut. Copper prices also remain subdued after having crashed below USD5,000 a metric ton for the first 
time since the financial crisis.
Gold held largely unchanged ahead of the minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve policy meeting due for 
publication later in the day. The minutes could offer vital clues about whether the Fed will likely make its first 
interest-rate hike in nearly a decade next month.
Besides the Fed minutes, investors await US inflation figures and current account data from the euro area later in 
the day for further direction.
Meanwhile, departing Bank of England policymaker David Miles said on Tuesday that interest rates would rise 
"pretty soon" and that this would be a reflection of the economy's strength rather than anything to worry about.
In corporate news, International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. said that it has received confirmation of the valid 
acceptance of its offer for Aer Lingus Group PLC in respect of all the latter's shares held by the Ryanair Group.
European Stocks Seen Subdued On China Worries
Motorola Solutions Inc. is in advanced talks to acquire UK-based communication services provider Airwave 
Solutions, the Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
UBS Group AG has announced the successful completion of the 2014 exchange offer by which all UBS AG shares 
that remain publicly held will be cancelled and UBS Group AG shares will be delivered as compensation.
Swiss telecommunication services firm Swisscom reported that its second-quarter 2015 net income rose to 433 
million Swiss francs from 430 million francs last year.
The European markets ended Tuesday's session mostly lower as copper and oil prices touched multi-year lows and 
China's stock-market selloff resumed despite positive home-price data and a large cash injection into the country's 
financial system by its central bank to keep cash from fleeing.
Investors also awaited a German parliament vote over a third bailout plan for Greece and the release of minutes 
from the Federal Reserve's July meeting for further direction. The German DAX eased 0.2%, France's CAC 40 
index slid 0.3% and the UK's FTSE 100 fell 0.4%.
US stocks ended a choppy session lower overnight in response to weak commodity prices, disappointing earnings 
results from Wal-Mart and another bout of turbulence in China's equity market.
Housing market indicators painted a relatively optimistic picture, with housing starts climbing to a near eight-year 
high in July, while building permits fell 16.3% in the month following three straight months of hefty increases. The 
Dow dropped 0.2%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 0.6% and the S&P 500 shed 0.3%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group on Tuesday said its offer for Aer Lingus has 
become unconditional after it received confirmation that Ryanair Holdings PLC has formally accepted the offer.
Ryanair's acceptance of the offer had been one condition required for the deal to go through. Ryanair owned a 
29.8% stake in Aer Lingus.
"We'd like to welcome Aer Lingus into IAG.  It will remain an iconic Irish brand with its base and management team 
in Ireland but will now grow as part of a strong, profitable airline group. This means new routes and more jobs 
benefitting customers, employees and the Irish economy and tourism," Chief Executive Willie Walsh said in a 
statement.
IAG said it has received valid acceptances of the offer from 95.77% of Aer Lingus shareholders.
The offer will remain open until September 1.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Cantor Fitzgerald says Ryanair Holdings' current trading is strong and expects 
management to lift profit guidance, but it cuts the airline to Hold from Buy saying it believes the good news is priced 
in. 
Cantor analyst Robin Byde says Ryanair stated in its first-quarter results in July that financial year 2016 net profit 
would likely be at the upper-end of the range of EUR940 million to EUR970 million. 
"Consensus (Bloomberg) is already showing a net profit of EUR1.01 billion for FY16, and EUR1.21 billion for FY17. 
We now lift our estimates for FY16-FY18, by an average of 4% each year. We assume more passengers (e.g. 103 
million from 100 million in FY16), better average yields and some further fuel cost savings," Byde says. 
The analyst also assumes the board will approve a EUR0.40 dividend payment for early 2016, and says there is a 
general expectation among investors of more cash returns. 
Byde notes the company's strong July traffic statistics and says that while current trading is strong, it is priced into 
shares.
"The stock has outperformed the FTSE Eurofirst 300 airlines index by 33% over the past year, and has 
outperformed easyJet by 22% in the past quarter," the analyst says. "Consensus forecasts already anticipate that 
earnings will beat current guidance. More cash returns should flow but this is expected."
Cantor raises its price target to EUR14.00 from EUR13.50.
Ryanair trades down 0.6% at EUR12.84 at the open Monday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC Wednesday said 
they grew both passenger numbers and load factor in July on the same month the year before.
Ryanair said its customer numbers rose 11% year-on-year to 10.1 million in July from 9.2 million, while its load 
factor increased to 95% from 91%. It claimed that this was the first time that any airline has carried more than 10 
million international customers in one month.
"These record customer numbers and highest ever load factors are due to our lower fares, our stronger forward 
bookings, and the continuing success of our 'Always Getting Better' customer experience programme, which 
continues to deliver stronger than expected traffic and load factors on our biggest ever summer schedule," Chief 
Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Wizz Air said its passenger numbers grew 20% year-on-year to 2.0 million from 1.6 million, while its 
load factor increased to 92.7% from 91.6%. It said the peak summer season brought enhancements and changes 
to its customer offering.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group SA said Thursday that its group traffic, 
measured in revenue passenger kilometres, rose 9.4% in July compared to the previous year.
The owner of British Airways and Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling said group capacity measured in available 
seat kilometres rose by 5.5% compared to the previous year, and premium traffic rose 8.7%. Passenger load factor 
rose to 85.7% in July from 82.6% a year before. 
The company's deal to acquire Aer Lingus Group PLC was cleared by the European Commission in July, although 
it was forced to extend the deadline for shareholders to accept its bid for Aer Lingus due to a delay caused by major 
Aer Lingus shareholder Ryanair Holdings PLC, which missed the deadline to accept the bid. The deadline has been 
extended to August 18. 
Earlier Wednesday, Ryanair and fellow low-cost airline Wizz Air Holdings PLC also said they grew both passenger 
numbers and load factor in July on the same month the year before.
Shares in International Consolidated Airlines were up 1.1% at 551.50 pence Wednesday adternoon.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group on Friday maintained its targets for the 
current financial year as its operating profit surged in the first half, though it was forced to extend the deadline for 
shareholders to accept its bid for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC due to a delay caused by major Aer Lingus 
shareholder Ryanair Holdings PLC.
IAG, which owns British Airways and Spanish airline Iberia, said its operating profit excluding exceptional items in 
the first half to the end of June was up to EUR555 million, sharply higher than the EUR230 million it posted a year 
earlier.
The profit was driven primarily by British Airways, which made a EUR570 million profit in the half, though Iberia also 
cut its loss to EUR4 million from EUR95 million, while Vueling turned to a loss of EUR5 million having delivered a 
flat performance a year earlier.
Total revenue for IAG rose to EUR10.36 billion from EUR9.29 billion, as its passenger revenue in the half increased 
to EUR9.12 billion from EUR8.18 billion. At constant currencies, however, revenue was down by 2%, as the 
reported figure was flattered by the weak euro.
The carrier said its available seat kilometres capacity measure increased 5.3% in the half, while its load factor 
improved to 79.3% from 78.9%. IAG said its passenger revenue per available seat kilometre rose 6.1% in the half, 
while its non-fuel unit costs per passenger rose 4.3%. Passenger numbers in the quarter rose by 8.9% to 38.6 
million from 35.5 million.
IAG said its expectations for the year remain unchanged, and it is still targeting an operating profit for the year in 
excess of EUR2.2 billion.
"We said previously that profit improvement would be slower in the second quarter, and we are on track to reach 
our full-year targets. We continue to take cost out of the business, with both employee and supplier unit costs down 
at constant currency, and improvements in productivity levels," said Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive.
UPDATE: IAG Profit Up, Targets Affirmed; Aer Lingus Deadline Extended
IAG said the first half has seen decreasing fuel prices partially offset by adverse exchange rates. Overall, though, 
exchange rate movements proved a boon for the carrier in the half, with the weakness of the euro against sterling 
only partially offset by the strengthening dollar. Fuel prices for the company were down 6.7% in constant currencies 
in the half, in line with the benefits being felt across the aviation industry from the fall in the oil price in the past year.
European revenue for the group rose by 8% in constant currencies, while capacity in the region rose by 13% in part 
through higher seat densities on IAG planes but also by increases in capacity for its low-cost Iberia Express and 
Vueling carriers. Latin American operations were somewhat hit by weakness in the Brazilian and Venezuelan 
markets, while Africa, Middle East and South Asia revenue fell due the weakening of oil routes. North Atlantic 
passenger revenue was broadly flat in the half.
Passenger revenue yields in the half were hit by the growth for its low-cost carriers, though British Airways yields 
also were hurt by increased competitor capacity on transatlantic routes, in addition to currency effects. Cargo 
revenue fell 8% in constant currencies, reflecting the reduction in its cargo freighter programme, while other 
revenue rose by 6.3%, including a EUR50 million benefit from Avios, IAG's frequent flyer and travel rewards 
programmes unit.
IAG has spent the majority of the first half focused on securing the necessary acceptances for its EUR1.4 billion 
takeover bid for Aer Lingus. On Friday, however, it said it has so far only received 62.5% acceptances from Aer 
Lingus shareholders, with Ryanair, the budget carrier which owns a 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus, missing the 
deadline on Thursday to accept the bid. As a result, IAG has extended the bid deadline to August 18.
The Irish Independent reported that Ryanair may have deferred accepting the offer for accounting purposes, 
allowing it to delay the arrival of the EUR400 million it will get from selling its Aer Lingus stake to IAG. A Ryanair 
spokesman told the paper on Thursday that the company does not expect to receive the proceeds from the sale 
until September, and so it is planning to formally accept the offer in mid-August.
IAG's attempt to acquire Aer Lingus has been rumbling on since December, when the pair first entered talks. The 
Aer Lingus board has consistently backed the deal, but IAG was forced to work harder to get the blessings of both 
Ryanair and the Irish government. Earlier this month Ryanair said its board had voted in favour of the deal, 
following on from the Irish government approval in May.
The deal then moved into the final furlong this month when the European Commission gave its approval for the 
takeover. In order to secure that, IAG said it had to give up five slots at Gatwick airport for flights to Dublin and 
Belfast. Two of the five must be operated between Gatwick and Dublin and one must be operated to Belfast, under 
the concessions. Other airlines will be able to apply for seats on the Aer Lingus short-haul network for their transfer 
passengers on normal commercial terms, IAG said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Analysts at Nomura and Liberum reiterate their Buy rating on International Consolidated 
Airlines Group after it released an encouraging set of half-year results,  which came ahead of consensus. 
The FTSE 100-listed airline, which owns British Airways and Iberia and which is in the process of acquiring Irish flag 
carrier Aer Lingus Group said its operating profit excluding exceptional items in the first half to the end of June was 
up to EUR555 million, sharply higher than the EUR230 million it posted a year earlier. It also was ahead market 
consensus estimates, which were EUR494 million. 
IAG reiterated its 2015 operating profit target of over EUR2.2 billion. Nomura forecasts full-year operating profit to 
come in at EUR2.25 billion compared to the company-compiled consensus of EUR2.27 billion. 
On Friday, IAG said it has so far only received 62.5% acceptances from Aer Lingus shareholders, with Ryanair, the 
budget carrier which owns a 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus, missing the deadline on Thursday to accept the bid. As a 
result, IAG has extended the bid deadline to August 18.
"We continue to believe that the deal makes strong strategic and financial sense and, despite the short-term 2Q unit 
revenue softness, we retain our Buy rating and 700p target price," says Nomura analyst James Hollins. 
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo says the company's results for the June quarter came in slightly ahead of its above-
consensus forecast. 
"There were substantial exchange-rate distortions to revenues and costs in Q2, although the net effect was positive. 
These distortions should moderate in H2. Compared with our estimates, both revenues and costs were higher than 
expected. We suspect that we continue to underestimate the gross FX impacts on both lines," the analyst adds. 
Liberum has a 700.00 pence price target. 
IAG trades down 1.5% at 534.00 pence late Friday morning. 
IN THE KNOW: IAG Results Beats Consensus But Cantor Is Unconvinced
Cantor Fitzgerald reiterates its Sell rating and 520.00 pence price target, saying it continues to see limited upside to 
its forecasts for the company and its valuation is unattractive.  
"We remain somewhat concerned about the group's reliance on profits at British Airways (over 80%), and hence, 
North American traffic," says Cantor analyst Robin Byde.
"We think that there is some potential regulatory risk that the on-going US Department of Justice investigation into 
possible collusion by US airlines on US domestic fares, could spill-over into a review of the impact of merged 
transatlantic airline alliance operations," the analyst adds.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair's results were in line with expectations but while it said it expects pretax profit 
at the top end of guidance for the full year, Liberum says this was already anticipated by markets and leaves little 
scope for further consensus upgrades.
Liberum says Ryanair's in line results and unchanged guidance may disappoint optimists and limit any upgrades to 
consensus estimates in the short-term. It says that  the 25% rise in net profit for the carrier was impressive, but 
thinks the rate of improvement will moderate in coming quarters.
However, there was further evidence of Ryanair's figures being flattered by cheaper fuel and higher load factors, 
with non-fuel unit costs rising by 4% on a per-seat basis in the quarter.
Though Ryanair did say that its full-year pretax profit will come at the top end of guidance, consensus estimates 
were already in this range, meaning there is limited scope for upward revisions at present. Nonetheless, Liberum 
says it remains optimistic on the outlook for Ryanair and noted the carrier's management is notorious for providing 
conservative guidance.
It keeps a Hold rating and unchanged EUR12 price target on Ryanair.
Panmure Gordon retains a more positive stance on the company, however, saying its strong earnings momentum 
and defendable cost advantage justify its enhanced valuation. It also cites Ryanair's long-term growth prospects, 
attractive returns and strong cash generation and reasons to remain optimistic on its outlook.
Panmure keeps a Buy rating and EUR14 target on Ryanair.
Ryanair shares are down 1.1% to EUR12.14.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said its pretax profit in the first quarter of its financial 
year rose by 25% on the back of more passengers, higher revenue and better margins for the Irish budget carrier, 
prompting it to hike its pretax profit guidance for the full year.
Ryanair said its pretax profit for the three months to the end of June was up to EUR245 million, from EUR197 
million a year earlier, on the back of a 10% rise in revenue to EUR1.65 billion from EUR1.50 billion. The group's net 
margin in the quarter improved to 15% from 13%.
Ryanair said it carried 28 million customers in the quarter, up 16% from the 24.3 million it carried a year earlier.
On the back of the results, Ryanair said it has raised its full-year traffic target to 103 million passengers from 100 
million previously and said its pretax profit for the full year will be towards the upper-end of its previously-guided 
range of EUR940 million to EUR970 million. 
The group did add, however, that meeting this guidance will be heavily-dependent on its second-half fare levels, 
over which it has "almost zero visbility" right now.
"We are pleased to report strong growth in traffic and profits in the first quarter. Our mix of low fares, best on time 
performance and enhanced customer experience under our 'Always Getting Better' programme, continues to attract 
millions of new customers," said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said its pretax profit in the first quarter of its financial 
year rose by 25% on the back of more passengers, higher revenue and better margins for the Irish budget carrier, 
prompting it to hike its pretax profit guidance for the full year, though shares in the company were off in London 
trade as consensus estimates were already pricing in profit at the top end of expectations.
Ryanair said its pretax profit for the three months to the end of June was up to EUR245 million, from EUR197 
million a year earlier, on the back of a 10% rise in revenue to EUR1.65 billion from EUR1.50 billion. The group's net

On the back of the results, Ryanair said it has raised its full-year traffic target to 103 million passengers from 100

range of EUR940 million to EUR970 million. 
The group did add, however, that meeting this guidance will be heavily-dependent on its second-half fare levels, 
over which it has "almost zero visbility" right now. Liberum said the in-line results from Ryanair and its unchanged 
guidance may limit any upgrades to consensus estimates in the short-term, as most estimates were already

The broker added there was further evidence of Ryanair's figures being flattered by cheaper fuel and higher load

Ryanair said it carried 28 million customers in the quarter, up 16% from the 24.3 million it carried a year earlier. This 
number is expected to rise in during the course of the financial year, with the company set to increase it fleet size to 
340 by the end of the year, with a further 31 to be added in the winter.

month and, in November, will start operating its first flights to Israel.
In addition to the passenger volume estimate upgrade, Ryanair said it expects passenger volumes to grow by 13% 
in the first half and by 15% for the full year, driven by a strong load factor and better winter grounding levels.
The group added that it now expects average fares for the first half to be broadly flat year-on-year, from previous 
guidance of flat to a 2% decline, due to the strong first quarter performance and reasonable visibility going into the 
second quarter.
It added it has very little visibility on the second half of the year, during which it expects its capacity growth ramp up 
and lower oil price may lead to an aggressive pricing response from its competitors, meaning it is retaining a 
cautious stance on prices and yields for the winter.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UK stock futures point to a lower open Monday, with investors turning their attention to 
economic data from Germany and the US as Greece's new bailout talks are delayed until Tuesday for "technical 
reasons". 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 to open 11 points lower at 6,568.50 points. The index closed down 1.1% at 
6,579.81 on Friday.
On the UK corporate front, Ryanair Holdings said its pretax profit in the first quarter of its financial year rose by 25% 
on the back of more passengers, higher revenue and better margins for the Irish budget carrier, prompting it to hike 
its pretax profit guidance for the full year.
Ryanair said its pretax profit for the three months to the end of June was up to EUR245 million, from EUR197 
million a year earlier, on the back of a 10% rise in revenue to EUR1.65 billion from EUR1.50 billion. The group's net 
margin in the quarter improved to 15% from 13%. 
It said its pretax profit for the full year will be towards the upper-end of its previously-guided range of EUR940 
million to EUR970 million. 
Meanwhile, pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca said it has signed an agreement with Genzyme to sell Astra's 
Caprelsa rare disease medicine. AstraZeneca said Genzyme will pay it up to USD300 million, including a USD165 
million upfront payment, to acquire the global rights to sell and develop Caprelsa.
Reckitt Benckiser said it has upgraded its like-for-like revenue growth target for the full year after its pretax profit 
rose in the first half thanks to a solid performance across the business.

The FTSE 100-listed consumer goods company, which makes products including cleaning spray Cillit Bang, 
Nurofen painkillers and Durex condoms, said its pretax profit for the six months to the end of June was GBP921 
million, up from GBP838 million a year earlier.
UBS raises its easyJet price target to 1,950 pence from 1,880p, keeping a Buy stance, while Jefferies lifts its 
Barclays price target to 357p from 340p, reiterating a Buy recommendation. Societe Generale upgrades Drax 
Group to Hold from Sell, and Goldman Sachs cuts Britvic price target to 810p from 838p, keeping the stock in its 
'Conviction Buy List'.
On the European economic front, CESifo Group business sentiment survey results from Germany and eurozone 
money supply data are both expected at 0900 BST.
"The German IFO survey will provide further indications of economic activity in the euro area at the start of the third 
quarter," says Lloyds Bank. "Coming after the expected pickup in the second quarter, recent survey evidence has 
been mixed."
"Overall, the broad picture of strengthening activity compared with last year still remains intact and we have 
pencilled in a rise in the headline IFO index to 107.6 from 107.4, firmer than the market consensus of a slight dip to 
107.2," writes the bank. 
Greece's talks with its creditors over a new bailout package will be delayed until Tuesday "for technical reasons" 
and are "neither political nor diplomatic" in nature, a finance ministry official says. 
The meetings with representatives from the European Commission, European Central Bank, International Monetary 
Fund, and possibly the European Stability Mechanism, were supposed to have started on Monday. The finance 
ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said negotiations at the technical level will start on Tuesday, 
adding that the mission chiefs will arrive in Athens with a delay of "one or two days" due to technical reasons."
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 closed down 1.0%. In China, the Hang Seng is down 2.6% and the 
Shanghai Composite is down 3.8%.
Profits earned by Chinese industrial enterprises increased in June, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics 
showed. Industrial profits rose 0.3% year-over-year to CNY588.57 billion in June following a 0.6% rise in the 
preceding month.
The agency said the slowdown in industrial profit growth for the month was impacted by a decline in industrial 
producer prices, higher unit costs and tough comparisons with the year-ago period, when profits surged up 17.9%. 
During the first six months of the year, total industrial profits declined by 0.7% as compared to the corresponding 
period last year.
Wall Street ended lower Friday. The DJIA closed down 0.9%, the S&P 500 ended down 1.1% and the Nasdaq 
Composite finished down 1.1%. US investors will focus Monday on the release of US durable goods orders data, 
which are expected at 1330 BST.
"US core durable goods are expected to come in slightly better than the previous month, with a rise of 0.5% 
expected, while including transportation a rise of 3.2% is expected due to orders placed during the recent Paris Air 
show," says CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson.

PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets were in negative territory on Monday, as investors turned their 
focus to the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday, for any clues on rate-hike.
In economic news, Germany's business confidence improved more-than-expected in July, reports said citing data 
from the the Munich-based Ifo Institute. The Ifo Business Climate Index rose to 108 in July, well above the 107.5 
score economists had forecast. In June, the reading dropped to a four-month low of 107.4.
Germany's import prices declined at a faster-than-expected pace in June, data from Destatis showed. Import prices 
slid 1.4% year-over-year in June, just above economists' expectations for a 1.3% decrease.
Meanwhile, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that profits earned by Chinese industrial 
enterprises increased in June. Industrial profits rose 0.3% year-over-year to 588.57 billion yuan in June, following a 
0.6% rise in the preceding month.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks was losing 0.89%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, was falling 0.98%.
The German DAX declined 1.3%, the French CAC 40 dropped 1.4% and Switzerland's SMI dropped 0.9%. The 
FTSE 100 index of the UK slipped 0.2%.
In Frankfurt, Commerzbank declined 2.7% and Deutsche Bank fell 2.1%.
Henkel and Basf dropped about 1.8% each.
Carmakers Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler were in negative territory.
In Paris, Valeo declined more than 3% after the car parts maker sent out first-half figures.
Credit Agricole, Societe Generale and BNP Paribas were firmly in negative territory.
European Markets Fall Ahead Of Fed Meet
Renault fell 1.5% and Peugeot was modestly lower.
In London, Merlin Entertainments fell 3.5% after it warned of full-year profit.
Ryanair dropped about 1% after issuing a cautious outlook.
Meanwhile, Reckitt Benckiser gained 2.8% after first-half profit rose.
UBS, which reported second-quarter results, fell over 1% in Zurich.
Philips added 3.6% in Amsterdam. The company reported increased profit for the second quarter.
TNT fell about 1%, even after second-quarter loss narrowed.
The Asian stocks fell broadly, as a continued downtrend in commodity prices, weak US corporate results and a 
stronger yen kept investors' risk appetite in check.
In the US, futures point to a lower open on Wall Street. In the previous session, the Dow shed 0.9%, while the tech-
heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 dropped about 1.1% each.
Crude for September delivery fell USD0.32 to USD47.82 per barrel, while August gold advanced USD13.4 to 
USD1098.9 a troy ounce.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets ended the first day of the new trading week firmly in negative 
territory. The sharp drop in the Chinese stock market weighed on investor sentiment Monday. Investors also 
decided to exercise caution ahead of the Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting this week.
The Shanghai Composite Index plunging 345.35 points or 8.5% to 3,725.56. The decrease, which marked the 
biggest percentage drop by the index since February of 2007, reflected concerns about the Chinese economy.
The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged when its concludes its 2-day meeting on Wednesday. 
Traders are likely to keep a close eye on the accompanying statement for any hints about the timing of the first rate 
hike.
There is no need for an interest rate hike soon in the UK, Bank of England's Chief Economist Andy Haldane told 
BBC Newsnight.
Haldane repeated that rates could go up or down in the future and that he thought the current level was appropriate 
for the near term.
At the July monetary policy meeting, more members moved closer to vote for a rate hike. For those members, 
Greece was a material factor in holding the rate at 0.50%.
Haldane said he saw economic "headwinds" such as demographic change, the overhang of high debt and its 
aftermath and the rise of short-termism that could mean economic growth in the future is weaker than in the past.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks decreased by 2.41%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, lost 2.15%.
The DAX of Germany dropped by 2.56% and the CAC 40 of France fell by 2.57%. The FTSE of the UK declined by 
1.13% and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 1.38%.
European Markets Dropped On China Weakness & Caution Ahead Of Fed Meeting
In Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank decreased by 3.59% and Commerzbank fell by 2.88%.
BMW dropped by 2.86% and Daimler lost 2.63%. Volkswagen also finished with a loss of 1.98%.
RWE weakened by 1.77% and E.ON surrendered 1.68%.
In Paris, Valeo declined by 5.41%, after the car parts maker reported first-half figures.
Peugeot decreased by 3.47% and Renault lost 3.27%.
Societe Generale dropped by 3.05% and BNP Paribas fell by 2.62%. Credit Agricole also closed down by 1.64%.
In London, Merlin Entertainments fell by 4.28%, after it warned of full-year profit.
Ryanair dropped by 2.20%, after issuing a cautious outlook.
Reckitt Benckiser gained 1.44%, after its first-half profit rose.
UBS, which reported second-quarter results, fell by 1.62% in Zurich.
Philips increased by 1.41% in Amsterdam. The company reported increased profit for the second quarter.
TNT fell by 1.15%, even after its second-quarter loss narrowed.
Germany's business morale unexpectedly improved in July after concerns due to the uncertainty regarding Greece 
and its future in euro eased, results of a key survey revealed Monday.
The Ifo Business Climate Index for German trade and industry rose to 108 from June's revised 107.5, a four month-
low. Economists had expected the measure to edge up a point from June's 107.4 original score.
Germany's import prices declined at a faster-than-expected pace in June, data from Destatis showed Monday. 
Import prices slid 1.4% year-over-year in June, just above economists' expectations for a 1.3% decrease. In May, 
prices had fallen 0.8%.
UK factory order growth slowed in July to its lowest level in two years, as a strong sterling and weak global 
conditions weighed on the export outlook, survey data from the Confederation of British Industry showed Monday. 
The total order book balance dropped to -10% in July, which was the lowest since July 2013, when it was -12%. 
Economists had expected a balance figure of -7.
After reporting a sharp drop in new orders for US manufactured durable goods in the previous month, the 
Commerce Department released a report on Monday showing that orders rebounded strongly in the month of June.
The report said durable goods orders jumped by 3.4% in June following a revised 2.1% decrease in May. 
Economists had expected orders to increase by 3.1% compared to the 2.2% drop that had been reported for the 
previous month.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum hikes its target price on budget carrier easyJet following its strong third-quarter 
trading update, upping its earnings forecasts for the company to the top end of company guidance.
On Wednesday, easyJet said it beat its guidance for revenue per seat in the third quarter, even as its total revenue 
fell for the period, and said it expects its pretax profit for the full-year to grow on the back of its strong second half 
performance.
While overall revenue was down, driven by a series of issues the airline faced in the quarter, Chief Executive 
Carolyn McCall said that, with 77% of its second-half seats now booked, the company expects to post a pretax 
profit of GBP620 million to GBP660 million for the year to the end of September, compared to GBP581 million a 
year earlier. 
Liberum upgrades its earnings per share estimates for 2015 by 1% following the update, reflecting an improved 
revenue outlook after the revenue-per-seat beat and a flat-to-positive outlook for the fourth quarter.
The better-than-expected revenue per seat performance was the highlight of the trading update, Liberum says, and 
the broker expects easyJet to continue to focus on cost controls through self-help measures.
The broker says easyJet's valuation, at 13.3 times 2015 earnings and at a 27% discount to Irish rival Ryanair 
Holdings, looks attractive in absolute terms. It expects the discount to Ryanair to continue to narrow as easyJet 
continues to deliver a combination of growth, value creation and cash generation, underpinned by strong positions 
as key primary airports and a robust value-for-money appeal to consumers.
Liberum reiterates a Buy rating and ups its price target to 1,930 pence from 1,875p.
Shares in easyJet are flat at 1,748.20p Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Analysts are keeping positive views on easyJet after the budget carrier said 
Wednesday it beat its guidance for revenue per seat in its third quarter, even as its total revenue fell for the period.
The FTSE 100-listed airline said its revenue per seat was down by 5.4% in the three months to the end of June to 
GBP59.08, slightly better than the guidance it issued in May. The better-than-expected figure was driven by good 
trading in the UK and on beach routes in Europe in May and June. These bright spots partly offset the impact of 
French air traffic controls strikes in April.
Total revenue in the quarter was down 1% to GBP1.23 billion. Capacity rose by 4.7% to 20.8 million seats, and 
passengers carried rose by 6.2% to 19.1 million. Load factor increased 1.3 percentage points to 91.7%.
Cantor Fitzgerald says easyJet's trading was "strong", and says the guidance provided by the budget carrier 
includes some headwinds that have to be taken into account.  
The airline said it expects to grow pretax profit to a range of GBP620 million to GBP660 million in financial year 
2015 to September 30 from GBP581 million in financial year 2014.
"Probably the key near term risk is that [around] 3,500 Unite-member cabin crew will take strike action, this process 
is on-going," writes Cantor analyst Robin Byde. "We believe that easyJet’s full year guidance includes some 
potential impact of strike action, uncertainty around Greece and North African markets and reduction of capacity at 
Rome [airport] Fiumicino."
In June, the company said it will expand its bases in Milan and Naples and open a new base in Venice, shifting 
aircraft from its Rome base because it is delivering lower returns than other bases.
"We believe that this is a cautious but positive trading statement," Cantor's Byde says. The broker keeps a Buy 
recommendation and a price target of 1,900 pence.
Shares in easyJet are up 4.3% at 1,737.00 pence Wednesday morning. 
MORE IN THE KNOW: Analysts Remain Positive After EasyJet Update
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo calls the easyJet update "reassuring". The broker warns that "challenges remain from 
the uncertain macro and operational environment, but we see valuation upside in absolute terms and relative to 
Ryanair Holdings."
Liberum retains a Buy stance on easyJet and a price target of 1,875p, while Panmure Gordon also keeps a Buy 
rating for the stock, with a price target of 2,000p.
Meanwhile, Numis calls easyJet's performance "strong" and "encouraging", and highlights the airline's guidance. 
"Our forecast is in the middle of this [annual pretax profit forecast] range at GBP640.1 million, and we are leaving it 
unchanged at present," says Numis analyst Wyn Ellis. "With all the concerns that the market has had about excess 
capacity in the market and the likely impact on yields, we believe that these results will be well received," writes the 
analyst. 
Ellis believes that easyJet is well-placed to drive further strong growth "due to the quality of its network, the 
opportunity to take share from legacy carriers, increased business traffic and further sustainable cost savings."
Numis, which is a market marker in easyJet, keeps an Add recommendation on the stock and a price target of 
1,850p.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Shares in budget carrier easyJet have been under pressure recently due to competition 
and management concerns, but Deutsche Bank thinks the company still looks in good shape and says investors' 
worries about competition are overdone.
Deutsche says investors have been shaky on easyJet for three reasons. First, there has been little evidence from 
the company that it can compete with Ryanair when threatened at its primary airport, something the Irish carrier has 
never been shy of trumpeting.
The bank says concerns also exist about the ability of the team's new management and added there are worries 
about short-term overcapacity and new entrants in the low-cost carrier space.
Deutsche says the competition from Ryanair needs to be assessed based on network overlap, both on an airport-
to-airport and city-to-city basis, since each has a different threat level to be taken into account. The bank says that 
its analysis shows the highly-competitive overlap for easyJet and Ryanair at a relatively low 7.5% of easyJet 
capacity.
To put that issue to bed, however, Deutsche says easyJet management needs to highlight four or five cases where 
the carrier has maintained its share after Ryanair has entered the fray.
Management change is a difficult issue to comment on, Deutsche says, but says easyJet is best-in-class for 
exposing its entire operational management team to the market. As a result, the bank has a high degree of 
confidence in easyJet's second-tier of management at the moment, including Chief Operating Officer Warwick 
Brady and Group Commercial Director Cath Lynn.
On Deutsche's calculations, easyJet has offered the best return on capital employed amongst European airlines 
over the past two years and thinks a continued focus on this measure will leave the company in good stead.
As a result, it pushes its target price on easyJet up to 1,915 pence from 1,830p and keeps its Buy rating on the 
stock. Shares in easyJet are up 0.6% to 1,670.00p.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidation Airlines Group SA said Thursday its recommended cash

The offer was originally set to close 1700 BST Thursday.
Last Friday Ryanair Holdings said its board had voted unanimously to accept IAG's offer, removing the final barrier 
in the way of IAG's takeover bid. FTSE 100-listed IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, made a EUR1.4 
billion takeover offer for Aer Lingus earlier this year and has already secured the Irish government's support for the 
bid, along with that of the Irish flag carrier's board.
Shares in International Consolidated Airlines closed up 0.7% at 556.84 pence Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum lifts Ryanair Holdings price target to EUR12 from EUR10.50 but cuts its 
recommendation to Hold from Buy, saying that moderating the higher non-fuel unit costs that have appeared in the 
past months is a key challenge not priced into the airline's shares. 
Analyst Gerald Khoo says Ryanair's turnaround over the past 18 months has been "remarkable". Shares in the 
company have risen by 77% in the past year and a half and by 27% in 2015 to date. Ryanair shares are down 0.6% 
at EUR12.64 Wednesday morning. 
The analyst says that from a position where it was losing ground to easyJet, Ryanair has revamped its business 
model, including some fundamental changes in airport strategy. 
However, higher unit costs have resulted, but are not immediately obvious in the budget carrier's results. Khoo says 
that, measured on a per seat basis, Ryanair’s non-fuel unit costs rose by 6% last year. He says that moderating this 
inflation is a key challenge not priced into that the market assumes will be achieved financially by Ryanair. 
"Some of this inflation is short-term, such as the additional marketing expenditure associated with the promotion of 
the Always Getting Better programme. However, we believe some of this is likely to be permanent and structural," 
writes the analyst. "For instance, additional IT development is likely to be an ongoing cost, as will higher charges at 
the primary airports that Ryanair is flying to/from more often."
The European Commission on Tuesday approved the purchase of Irish airline Aer Lingus by International 
Consolidated Airline Group, days after Ryanair's board voted unanimously to accept the British Airways and Iberia 
owner's offer for its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus. IAG made a EUR1.4 billion takeover offer for Aer Lingus late in 
2014.
Following Ryanair board's acceptance, Liberum's Khoo expect the cash proceeds to be paid out to shareholders 
eventually, either through another special dividend of EUR0.29 per share or through a top-up of the current share 
buyback programme. 
IN THE KNOW: Liberum Confident On Ryanair But Warns On Non-Fuel Costs
The analyst says Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus is worth EUR398 million. 
Liberum raises by 11% its earnings per share forecasts for the year to end March 31, 2016 and by 9% for the year 
to end March 2017. It expects 2016 EPS to be EUR72.65 cents and 2017 EPS to be EUR100.48 cents. The 
company reported EPS in 2015 of EUR62.59 cents. 
"We remain positive on Ryanair’s long-term fundamentals. Despite our concerns about non-fuel cost inflation, it 
remains comfortably the low-cost leader in Europe," writes Khoo. "We see little sign of this changing, even with 
additional costs from more expensive primary airports."
"We continue to view Ryanair as the long-term winner in the European airline industry," says the analyst. "However, 
we see limited scope for a further re-rating and given the inherently volatile nature of the airline industry we are 
reluctant to look much further forward than we do at present."

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum keeps a positive stance on easyJet, as the broker says it continues to see the 
airline as a long-term winner, with a competitive cost base, saying that fundamentals are not undermined by the 
closure of its base in Rome. 
While reiterating its confidence in the stock with a Buy recommendation, Liberum cuts easyJet's price target to 
1,875 pence from 2,000p. Shares in the airline are down 0.4% at 1,658.00p Wednesday morning. 
Shares in easyJet have dropped 14% from a high at 1,929p reached late January. 
"In the long term, we expect easyJet to remain amongst the winners in the European short-haul airline industry," 
writes Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo. "Its competitive cost base, value-for-money offering and established positions 
in key slot-constrained airports provide a platform for a continued balance between value creation, growth and cash 
generation."
In June, the company said it will expand its bases in Milan and Naples and open a new base in Venice, shifting 
aircraft from its Rome base because it is delivering lower returns than other bases. The moves mean that easyJet 
will no longer have any aircraft or crew based at Rome Fiumicino from April 2016. The crew currently based there 
will be offered jobs at other Italian bases. The airport will remain a part of its routes network.
"We consider this to be a minor strategic reversal for easyJet," says Khoo. "We expect the direct impact will be 
modest. Rome routes account for less than 6% of easyJet’s capacity, and we would expect the majority of these 
routes to be maintained."
However, Khoo highlights that the Rome base closure does damage easyJet’s efforts to target business travellers, 
especially those usually flying between Milan and Rome. 
"The Rome setback suggests that easyJet may struggle at primary airports where it is not quickly established as the 
No.2 airline to the incumbent flag carrier," writes the analyst.

The broker has trimmed its forecasts "modestly", having cut its earnings per share expectations for the year to end 
September 2015 by 7% to 129.4p, while also reducing by 7% its financial year 2016 EPS estimates to 146.5p. The 
company reported EPS in 2014 of 114.5p.
Meanwhile, Liberum lifts Ryanair Holdings price target to EUR12 from EUR10.50 but cuts its recommendation to

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group cleared the final hurdle in its EUR1.4 billion 
takeover bid for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC late on Tuesday, after the European Union gave its 
approval to the takeover with a concession made on the number of Gatwick slots the combined business will have.
IAG, which owns British Airways and Iberia, said it has had to give up five slots at Gatwick airport for flights to 
Dublin and Belfast in order to secure European Commission approval. Two of the five must be operated between 
Gatwick and Dublin and one must be operated to Belfast, under the concessions. Other airlines will be able to apply 
for seats on the Aer Lingus short-haul network for their transfer passengers on normal commercial terms, IAG said.
European approval was the final obstacle stood in the way of IAG completing the deal for Aer Lingus, with the path 
having been made clearer last week when Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Irish low budget carrier, said its board had 
voted in favour of accepting IAG's offer for its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus.
The Ryanair acceptance and the European approval bring to a close a takeover process which has been running 
since December 2014, when IAG first made its bid for Aer Lingus. The board of Aer Lingus has consistently backed 
the deal and the Irish government, which holds a 25% stake in the carrier, gave its backing in May.
Irish government approval had centred on the Aer Lingus brand being maintained by IAG and on its slots at 
Heathrow also remaining intact. IAG had already committed to both of those requests.
IAG shares were flat at 551.87 pence on Wednesday, while Aer Lingus shares were up 0.4% to EUR2.483.

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - The European Commission on Tuesday approved the purchase of Irish airline Aer 
Lingus by International Consolidated Airline Group, the owner of British Airways, after it made concessions to 
address competition concerns.
The EU's executive had been concerned that the merged company would face insufficient competition on some 
routes, and that Aer Lingus would no longer transport passengers who have connecting long-haul flights with rival 
airlines.
IAG, which also owns Iberia and low-cost carrier Vueling, agreed to offer up flight slots to rivals at London's Gatwick 
airport and pledged that Aer Lingus would continue to carry connecting passengers.
"By obtaining significant concessions from the airlines, the commission has ensured that air passengers will 
continue to have a choice of airlines at competitive prices," said EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe 
Vestager.
Last month, IAG offered 1.4 billion euros (15.4 billion dollars) to buy Aer Lingus, after the Irish government 
approved the move. It holds a 25% stake in the former national carrier.
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair also has a 30% stake in Aer Lingus.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said its board has voted 
unanimously to accept International Consolidated Airlines Group's offer for its stake in Aer Lingus Group PLC, 
removing the final barrier in the way of IAG's takeover bid.
FTSE 100-listed IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, made a EUR1.4 billion takeover offer for Aer Lingus 
earlier this year and has already secured the Irish government's support for the bid, along with that of the Irish flag 
carrier's board.
Ryanair said its board voted unanimously to accept the bid for its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus, saying it thinks the 
takeover "maximises Ryanair shareholder value". In line with the decision, Ryanair will vote in favour of the motion 
at the upcoming Aer Lingus extraordinary general meeting to accept IAG's offer.
"We believe the IAG offer for Aer Lingus is a reasonable one in the current market, and we plan to accept it, in the 
best interests of Ryanair shareholders. The price means that Ryanair will make a small profit on its investment in 
Aer Lingus over the past nine years," said Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said its board has voted 
unanimously to accept International Consolidated Airlines Group's offer for its stake in Aer Lingus Group PLC, 
removing the final barrier in the way of IAG's takeover bid and paving the way for the protracted transaction to go 
through.
FTSE 100-listed IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, made a EUR1.4 billion takeover offer for Aer Lingus 
late in 2014 and has already secured the Irish government's support for the bid, along with that of the Irish flag 
carrier's board.
Ryanair said its board voted unanimously to accept the bid for its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus, saying it thinks the 
takeover "maximises Ryanair shareholder value". In line with the decision, Ryanair will vote in favour of the motion 
at the upcoming Aer Lingus extraordinary general meeting to accept IAG's offer, subject to it securing European 
regulatory approval.
"We believe the IAG offer for Aer Lingus is a reasonable one in the current market, and we plan to accept it, in the 
best interests of Ryanair shareholders. The price means that Ryanair will make a small profit on its investment in 
Aer Lingus over the past nine years," said Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
Investor responded positively to the news, bidding up the shares of all three companies. IAG shares were up 2.7% 
to 528.50 pence in early trade on Friday, one of the best performers in the FTSE 100. Ryanair shares were up 2.1% 
to EUR12.36, while Aer Lingus shares were up 1.3% to EUR2.46.
Winning the support of Ryanair's board was the key hurdle in the way of IAG's attempt to acquire Aer Lingus, with 
the Irish government, which holds a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, having given its backing to the bid at the end of May.
The Irish government's support was given after IAG confirmed Aer Lingus would keep its existing slots at Heathrow 
airport and will operate its current daily winter and summer scheduled flights between Heathrow and Dublin, Cork 
and Shannon for at least seven years after the acquisition. The Aer Lingus brand also will be maintained.
UPDATE: Ryanair Board Accepts IAG's Offer For Its Aer Lingus Stake
Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots and its brand were at the centre of Irish government concerns over IAG's deal. 
Speaking in March in an interview with Ireland's Newstalk Radio, Irish Transport Minister Pascal Donoghue said 
that while its talks with IAG over the Aer Lingus deal had been "positive", it was seeking more assurances on 
measures to be taken to expand employment and protect Aer Lingus' brand identity and routes.
Donoghue said the Irish government at the time still held concerns about jobs and connectivity, echoing earlier 
statements made by Deputy Prime Minister Joan Burton, who also expected IAG to make further concessions to 
protect Aer Lingus' routes.
Aer Lingus itself has consistently backed the IAG takeover offer. Publishing its first-quarter results at the end of 
April, Aer Lingus said: "The board and management team of Aer Lingus strongly remain of the view that a 
combination of Aer Lingus and IAG has a compelling strategic rationale and will deliver significant benefits to all 
stakeholders in Aer Lingus."
"This is a compelling transaction for Aer Lingus, its shareholders, its employees, its customers and for Ireland. 
Shareholders will realise an attractive return through the premium that the IAG offer provides over the level of our 
share price immediately prior to the announcement of IAG’s offer," Colm Barrington, Aer Lingus' chairman, added in 
May.
Under the terms of the deal, IAG, will pay EUR2.55 per share in cash for Aer Lingus, split between a EUR2.50 cash 
payment and a EUR0.05 cash dividend per Aer Lingus share. The offer is at a premium of 40% to Aer Lingus' 
closing price of EUR1.82 per share on December 17, the last day of dealing prior to the initial offer having been 
made. It is also at a 77% premium to the volume-weighted average price of Aer Lingus shares in the six months 
prior to the offer being made.
Prior to the confirmation on Friday, all indications had pointed to Ryanair accepting the takeover offer, based on its 
opposition to the ruling made by the Competition and Markets Authority, the UK's antitrust regulator, that it must sell 
down its stake in Aer Lingus from 29.8% to 5%. Ryanair's initial request for the ruling to be overturned was made on 
the basis that IAG's bid for Aer Lingus undermines the CMA's view that Ryanair's substantial holding in Aer Lingus 
would deter any other companies from bidding for the carrier.
In June, the CMA handed down its final order requiring Ryanair to sell its Aer Lingus stake, though Ryanair said it 
would appeal the "ridiculous" ruling to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and will also seek permission to appeal the 
"unsustainable" 2013 report that contained the CMA's initial arguments to the UK Supreme Court. 
There had been concerns that Ryanair's decision to pursue an appeal of the ruling could severely delay IAG's 
takeover of Aer Lingus should the Supreme Court decide to hear the appeal, but Ryanair's announcement on 
Friday erased those worries.
The CMA, however, undermined Ryanair's argument that that IAG's bid for Aer Lingus makes the sell-down ruling 
irrelevant, noting that IAG wants to acquire Aer Lingus outright and can only force minority shareholders to sell 
should it secure more than a 75% stake in the company, something which would be impossible if Ryanair held on to 
its stake. Ryanair had argued that to take control of Aer Lingus, IAG would only need 50.1% of the shares and said 
it could not block it from doing that.
"It is clear that the timing of IAG's bid has been influenced by the prospect of Ryanair being forced to sell the 
majority of its shareholding. IAG has said that it would not be interested in acquiring any airline with a significant 
minority investor. The conditional nature of IAG's bid is consistent with this and our original assessment that 
Ryanair's presence was likely to deter other airlines from entering into, pursuing or concluding combinations with 
Aer Lingus," said Simon Polito, chair of the CMA's Ryanair/Aer Lingus inquiry group, when handing down the final 
ruling.
Ryanair itself had attempted to acquire Aer Lingus on a few occasions, most recently two years ago, when the 
takeover was blocked by the European Commission and rejected by the Irish government.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Ryanair Holdings said its board has voted unanimously to accept International Consolidated Airlines Group's offer 
for its stake in Aer Lingus, removing the final barrier in the way of IAG's takeover bid and paving the way for the 
protracted transaction to go through. The British Airways owner made a EUR1.4 billion takeover offer for Aer Lingus

----------
InterContinental Hotels Group said it has agreed to sell its stake in the InterContinental Hong Kong to Supreme Key 
Ltd for USD938 million. IHG said Supreme Key is a consortium of investors advised and managed by Gaw Capital 
Partners, the Hong Kong-based investment house. IHG will retain a 37-year management contract for the hotel, 
with three ten-year extension rights. It expects to be paid management fees of around USD8 million a year, which 
will increase after a refurbishment of the five-star hotel on the Kowloon waterfront is completed.
----------
Property developer Hammerson said it has sold its stake in the Grand Maine shopping centre, located south west of 
Angers in France, to an unnamed French institutional investor for EUR63.2 million. The shopping centre has 8,600 
square metres of retail space and was refurbished by Hammerson in 2013. It has a 95% occupancy rate and 
generates a gross rental income of EUR3.3 million a year.

Medical devices company Smith & Nephew said it has struck a deal to acquire the Russian distribution and 
manufacturing business of DeOst LLC and DC LLC, a unit of Russian manufacturing company DeOst. Smith & 
Nephew did not provide any financial details on the deal but said that taking on the manufacturing business will help 
it to reach more customers in Russia following recent changes to state tender rules supporting Russian-produced 
products.
----------
BT Group upped the stakes in its battle with Sky as the head of its consumer arm called on UK media and 
communications regulator Ofcom to amend the scope of its Digital Communications Review to include pay-TV, 
claiming high prices and poor outcomes for consumers arise from a lack of competition in the sector. Speaking to 
the Broadcasting Press Guild on Thursday, BT Consumer Chief Executive John Petter drew comparisons between 
the UK broadband market and the pay-TV sector, hitting back at calls Sky has made recently for a break-up of BT 
and claiming this push is a "smokescreen" designed to obscure the failings in the pay-TV market, which Sky 
dominates.
----------
Sirius Minerals said it is "rapidly moving" to progress what will be the world's largest potash mine in Yorkshire after 
securing approval from authorities at the beginning of July. The North York Moors National Park Authority, which 
regulates the national park in Yorkshire where the potash mine is to be built, gave Sirius the green light to build the 
UK's first new potash mine in 40 years on July 1. Sirius said it is "now rapidly moving to the next phases of 
financing and construction" of the project, and aims to deliver the definitive feasibility study for the mine before the 
end of 2015 and secure the first tranche of financing in the first quarter of 2016. 
----------

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Britain's trade deficit in goods in May was the smallest in nearly two years as imports declined and exports 
remained unchanged, data from the Office for National Statistics showed. The visible trade deficit for May was 
GBP8 billion, which was the smallest shortfall since June 2013. It also was smaller than the GBP9.7 billion deficit 
predicted by economists. In April, the trade deficit in goods was GBP9.4 billion. In May, imports of goods decreased 
by GBP1.4 billion to GBP32.6 billion, the lowest level since April 2011. Declines were seen in all the main 
commodity group imports and included a GBP0.5 billion decrease in imports of ships and a GBP0.4 billion fall 
attributed to material manufactures.
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair Puts IAG On Verge Of Winning Aer Lingus
----------
In a move seen as Greece's final bid to remain in the euro area, the government placed a cash-for-reforms proposal 
before creditors on Thursday that comprises spending cuts and tax hikes in exchange for a third bailout, 
acceptance of which will pave the way for further negotiations between both sides. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' 
request for at least EUR53.5 billion bailout funds for the next three years will be presented in the Greek parliament 
for approval on Friday. Eurozone finance ministers will meet on Saturday at 3 pm local time in Brussels to review 
the Greek request. That is scheduled to be followed by a summit attended by 28 EU national leaders on Sunday to 
reach a final agreement, though a EU official said Friday morning that the summit may not take place on Sunday if 
agreement is reached with the Eurogroup finance ministers on Saturday.
----------
French President Francois Hollande said that Greece's latest offer of belt-tightening measures in return for a three-
year loan are "serious and credible". Indicating his support for the Greek government, Hollande reinforced his 
position as a political ally of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' SYRIZA party ahead of weekend meetings in Brussels 
that will set the course for Greece's financial future. "The Greeks have shown their determination to remain in the 
eurozone," Hollande said, adding that "everything must be done to reach an agreement, a good agreement, an 
agreement that is respectful of European rules but also respectful of Greeks."
----------
Iran's chief diplomat, Mohammad Javad Zarif put the blame for the deadlock in nuclear talks squarely on his 
counterparts from six world powers as he started the 14th day of negotiations. Zarif reacted to warnings by US 
Secretary of State John Kerry, who said Thursday evening that he would walk away from the talks if Iran did not 
soon take the final steps to clinch the deal with Britain, China, France, Russia, the US and Germany, also known as 
the P5+1. "Unfortunately, some countries among the P5+1 have raised additional demands and have adopted a 
new stance," the Iranian foreign minister said. "This makes the negotiations difficult."
----------
EU interior ministers failed Thursday to meet a much-heralded goal of relocating 40,000 asylum seekers from Italy 
and Greece, but still hoped to achieve a breakthrough this month in response to a migration surge that has 
challenged Europe for months. "It's a very sensitive debate," said Luxembourg Immigration Minister Jean 
Asselborn, who chaired the talks since his country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
----------
French industrial output recovered as expected in May, the statistical office Insee reported. Industrial output grew 
0.4% month-on-month in May, reversing a 0.8% fall in April. This was the fastest growth in three months. The 
monthly rate matched economists' expectations.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets ended Friday's session firmly in positive territory, adding to the 
gains of the previous two trading sessions. Investors remain optimistic that a solution to the Greek debt crisis is in 
sight. The continued recovery of the Chinese stock market and the positive performance of the US equity markets 
also added to the positive mood among investors.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras submitted a cash-for-reforms proposal to creditors on Thursday that includes 
spending cuts, pension reforms and tax hikes in exchange for a 53.5 billion euro three-year bailout, a third for the 
country, acceptance of which will pave the way for further negotiations between both sides.
The Greek Parliament is set to discuss the proposal Friday evening and the vote outcome is expected early 
Saturday.
Eurozone finance ministers are scheduled meet on Saturday at 3 pm local time in Brussels to review the Greek 
request.
French President Francois Hollande described the Greek proposal as "serious, credible" in a Twitter post on Friday. 
The proposal showed "a determination to remain in the euro area," he added.
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he was more optimistic than before that an agreement will be struck 
between Greece and its creditors.
Meanwhile, Germany has been less upbeat regarding the new proposal, thanks to the Greek referendum that 
rejected austerity measures, and their stiff opposition to any debt relief for Greece. Some other eurozone members 
are also likely to oppose any debt write down for Greece.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been silent on Friday regarding the new proposal.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks increased by 3.39%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, added 2.11%.

dropped 0.5% year-on-year in June, slightly faster than May's 0.4% fall. The wholesale price index has been falling 
since July 2013.
French industrial output recovered as expected in May, the statistical office Insee reported Friday. Industrial output 
grew 0.4% month-on-month in May, reversing a 0.8% fall in April. This was the fastest growth in three months. The 
monthly rate matched economists' expectations.
Britain's trade deficit in goods in May was the smallest in nearly two years as imports declined and exports 
remained unchanged, data from the Office for National Statistics showed Friday. The visible trade deficit for May 
was GBP 8 billion, which was the smallest shortfall since June 2013. It was also smaller than the GBP 9.7 billion 
deficit predicted by economists.

increase, data from the Office for National Statistics showed Friday. Construction output fell 1.3% month-over-
month in May, faster than previous month's 0.5% drop. Economists had expected a 0.8% climb for the month.

released by the Commerce Department on Friday. The report said wholesale inventories increased by 0.8% in May 
after rising by 0.4% in April. Economists had expected inventories to rise by 0.3%.

Premier Oil, up 5.6% at 147.30 pence. Barclays reiterates its Overweight rating for Premier with a target price of 
250.0 pence. The company is making more cost savings than anticipated and is benefiting from its hedging

pence per share to raise GBP68.4 million to back its therapeutic programmes. Shares in the company closed at 
4.875 pence on Thursday.
Aurasian Minerals, up 15%. The South-East Asian focused miner said it has appointed Peter Mullens as its new 
chief executive, and that Mullens has agreed to subscribe to new Aurasian shares alongside a new non-executive 
director to raise GBP207,500 for the company. The company said Mullens has over 30 years of experience in 
mining and exploration geology and is currently a director of Royal Road Minerals, which is listed on the Toronto 
Stock Exchange. Previously, he had held roles at Lydian International and Aquiline Resources. 
Altona Energy, up 10%. The miner said its exploration licences for the Arckaringa coal project in southern Australia 
have been renewed and said it has signed a formal business relationship with Parsons Brinckerhoff, the US-based 
engineering and design firm. Altona said the South Australian government has granted 12-month extension to the 
drilling licences held by Altona at Arckaringa. 
Daniel Stewart Securities, down 8.5%. The company named the former chief executive of Sportingbet, the online 
gaming company sold to GVC Holdings and William Hill in 2013, as an independent non-executive director. Andrew

Sefton Resources, down 9.4%. The company said former Executive Chairman Jim Ellerton, who initiated legal

director in May, claiming damages related to his resignation from the company's board, the termination of his

LONDON (Alliance News) - Davy Research says Ryanair Holdings has reported another strong performance on 
load factor and volumes, after the Irish budget carrier on Thursday said its customer traffic and load factor both 
increased in June.
Ryanair said it carried 9.5 million customers in June, up 14% from the 8.3 million carried a year earlier. On a rolling 
12-month basis, the group's traffic to the end of June was 94.3 million customers, up 14% year-on-year. Ryanair's 
load factor also improved in June, up five percentage points to 93% from 88%.
Following the release of the data, Davy says it retains its Outperform stance in Ryanair Holdings. The stock is down 
0.1% at EUR12.29 Thursday afternoon. 
"This continues the strong volume trend set in April and May, when loads improved by 7 points in both months," 
says Davy Research analyst Ross Harvey. 
"Now in Year 2, the 'Always Getting Better' programme will continue to see a roll-out of service enhancements, 
including a new website, new app, new cabin interiors, new crew uniforms, improved in-flight menus, reduced fees 
and new digital features such as 'hold the fare' and price comparison services," writes Harvey.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday said car rental company Hertz 
has sent the company notice that it has terminated the car hire supply deal between the company, effective 
immediately.
Hertz has claimed that Ryanair's deal with GDS distribution companies represents a breach of contract, which 
Ryanair has disputed given this deal has been in place since April 2014 with, Ryanair claims, Hertz's knowledge 
and support.
Ryanair said it believes the termination of the contract by Hertz to be in breach of its long-term exclusive contract 
with Hertz, which was recently extended to 2020. As a result, the carrier is planning to pursue Hertz for breach of 
contract and damages.
As a result of the move, Ryanair will not be able to offer its customers car hire services via its website for around 
three months until it finds a suitable replacement for Hertz. Ryanair has issued a request for proposals to tender for 
the contract and expects to have a replacement in place by October.
"We regret Hertz's decision to end our car hire agreement at such short notice today, at a time that will cause 
maximum inconvenience to our customers during the peak travel period. We have had a long and successful 
partnership with Hertz, and it's a pity that this has ended in such an unfortunate and untimely manner," said Michael 
O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive.
"Since we expect that any losses arising from this interruption to our car hire services will be recovered from our 
legal proceedings against Hertz, we do not expect this interruption to have a material impact on current earnings," 
O'Leary added.
In an earlier statement on Thursday, Ryanair also said its customer traffic and load factor both increased in June.
Ryanair said it carried 9.5 million customers in June, up 14% from the 8.3 million carried a year earlier. On a rolling 
12-month basis, the group's traffic to the end of June was 94.3 million customers, up 14% year-on-year.
UPDATE: Ryanair Says Hertz Terminates Car Hire Deal
Ryanair's load factor also improved in June, up five percentage points to 93% from 88%.
Shares in Ryanair were up 0.2% to EUR12.33 just after midday on Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The independent Airports Commission on Wednesday gave its backing to the 
expansion of Heathrow airport after concluding that the move would deliver the most economic benefits to the UK.
Ryanair Holdings PLC immediately issued a statement in response saying the proposal doesn't go far enough and 
won't solve problem of restricted airport capacity in the South East.
The commission, set up in 2012 and led by economist Howard Davies, said a third runway at Heathrow, with a ban 
on night flights, would be the best way to boost the country's economy and secure the UK's future as a prominent 
player in the global aviation market.
The report said the third runway at Heathrow, the most expensive and the most politically controversial of the three 
options tabled to expand airport capacity in Britain, would generate up to GBP147 billion for the economy over 60 
years and create 70,000 new jobs by 2050.
The recommendations from the commission said the proposal to extend Gatwick, a less politically contentious idea, 
was "plausible" but said that failing to expand Heathrow would put the UK aviation sector's position at risk. The third 
option, which was to extend one of Heathrow's two existing runways, also was rejected.
Davies did, however, say that the expansion of Heathrow should only proceed with a "significant package of 
measures" to mitigate the impact of another runway on local communities and the environment. That would include 
a ban on all flights between 1130 pm and 0600 am, a legally-binding cap on noise levels, a levy to fund more 
generous compensation for those living under the flight path and an independent noise regulator.
Kenny Jacobs, the chief marketing officer Ryanair, said in response that the Irish budget carrier backs an even 
bigger three-runway solution, by which Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted would be able to build three competing 
runways and which would involve politicians being taken out of the process.
Jacobs said the company thinks this would solve the capacity issues facing the South East for the next century and 
would allow competition between the airports to deliver this capacity efficiently.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday kicked off its 'Keep Europe's 
Skies Open' petition in the European Union, a call to prevent consumers in Europe from having their holiday plans 
disrupted by striking Air Traffic Control unions.
Ryanair said it has repeatedly called on the European Commission and European Parliament to take action against 
strikes by these unions, specifically French ATC unions, which have staged 39 days of strike action since 2009.
The Ryanair petition calls to the removal of the ATC unions' right to strike and to allow other European ATCs to 
manage flights over French airspace during strike action.
"It's unacceptable that Europe's consumers repeatedly have their holiday and travel plans disrupted or cancelled by 
the selfish actions of ATC unions every summer, who use strikes as a first weapon rather than a last resort. French 
ATC unions will again stage three further days of strikes this week, which will impact hundreds of thousands of 
European consumers. It is particularly reprehensible that these strikes are taking place at the height of the peak 
summer season, deliberately targeting holiday makers and families," said Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing 
officer.
"It's time the Commission and Parliament took action to prevent Europe's families and ordinary air travellers having 
their hard earned holidays or travel plans regularly disrupted by these ATC unions closing the skies over Europe. If 
the EU won't listen to the airlines, perhaps they'll listen to Europe's citizens," he added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The independent Airports Commission on Wednesday gave its backing to the 
expansion of Heathrow airport after concluding that the move would deliver the most economic benefits to the UK, a 
move supported by trade bodies who called on the British government to act quickly to implement the 
recommendations.
The move was welcomed by trade bodies and by budget carrier easyJet PLC, though Irish budget carrier Ryanair 
Holdings PLC said the proposal does not go far enough and will not solve the capacity squeeze in the south east, 
while Gatwick Airport's chief dug in his heels and said his airport remains in the race.
The commission, set up in 2012 and led by economist Howard Davies, said a third runway at Heathrow, with a ban 
on night flights, would be the best way to boost the country's economy and secure the UK's future as a prominent 
player in the global aviation market.
The report said the third runway at Heathrow, the most expensive and the most politically controversial of the three

years and create 70,000 new jobs by 2050.

was "plausible" but said that failing to expand Heathrow would put the UK aviation sector's position at risk. The third 
option, which was to extend one of Heathrow's two existing runways, also was rejected.
Davies did, however, say that the expansion of Heathrow should only proceed with a "significant package of 
measures" to mitigate the impact of another runway on local communities and the environment. That would include 
a ban on all flights between 1130 pm and 0600 am, a legally binding cap on noise levels, a levy to fund more 
generous compensation for those living under the flight path, and an independent noise regulator.
2nd UPDATE: Trade Groups, easyJet Welcome 3rd Heathrow Runway Backing
"This debate has never been about a runway, it's been about the future we want for Britain. Expanding Heathrow 
will keep Britain as one of the world's great trading nations, right at the heart of the global economy. Our new plans 
have been designed around the needs of local communities and will meet carbon, air quality and noise targets, and 
provide the greatest benefit to the UK's connectivity and its long term economic growth," said John Holland-Kaye, 
the chief executive of Heathrow Airport.
Stewart Wingate, the chief executive of Gatwick Airport, was defiant following the report, saying the commission's 
findings made it clear that an expansion of Gatwick is deliverable and claiming his airport is "still very much in the 
race".
"It is for the commission to make a recommendation but it is of course for the government to decide. So we now 
enter the most important stage of the process. We are confident that when the government makes their decision 
they will choose Gatwick as the only deliverable option," Wingate said.
UK Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, speaking to parliament on Wednesday, said the task facing the 
government will be to "balance local interests against the wider, longer term benefits for the UK." "We will come 
back to Parliament in the autumn to provide clear direction to everyone on the government’s plans. This is a vital 
moment for the future of our aviation industry. All those with an interest in this important question are expecting us 
to act decisively," he added.
The British Chambers of Commerce said businesses in the UK will be pleased that the Airports Commission has 
finally published its recommendations and said firms across the nation want to see an "irreversible government 
commitment to a new runway at Heathrow by the end of 2015, with planning complete and diggers on the ground 
by the end of this parliament in 2020."
"The ball is now firmly in the government’s court. If ministers duck this decision, and delay airport expansion for yet 
another generation, British businesses and our overall competitiveness will pay the price," said John Longworth, 
director-general of the BCC. "Business long ago ran out of patience. The government cannot afford to delay airport 
expansion any further if it is serious about Britain punching above its weight on the global stage."
The Confederation of British Industry, another trade body, backed the BCC's view, saying the UK government "must 
commit to the decision now" and start working on expanding Heathrow. John Cridland, the outgoing director-
general of the CBI, who will be replaced later this year by Carolyn Fairbairn, said expanding capacity in the south 
east of England "is absolutely critical to the whole of the UK’s economic future."
"Each day the government delays taking the decision, the UK loses out as our competitors reap the rewards and 
strengthen their trade links. Creating new routes to emerging markets will open doors to trade, boosting growth, 
creating jobs and driving investment right across the country. Our research shows that eight new daily routes alone 
could boost exports by up to GBP1 billion a year. The UK’s economic future cannot be kept waiting on the tarmac 
any longer. By taking the decision now, the government can send the message, loud and clear, that Britain is open 
for business," Cridland added.
The BCC and CBI's calls for the government to act quickly and enact the recommendations in the report also was 
backed by the Trades Union Congress. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said the government 
needs to act to implement the findings, "not let them sit in archives, gathering dust".
A further call for expediency also was issued by the Institute of Directors, which said it "warmly welcomes" the 
commission's report. "This is the issue that has been kicked down the road time and again, but there can now be no 
further delay from politicians. Sir Howard has left the government with no excuse to put off this vital decision again, 
and if ministers do not proceed with all possible speed, it will send a clear signal that the UK is not interested in 
being a modern, outward-looking, trading nation," said IoD Director-General Simon Walker.
FTSE 100 budget carrier easyJet welcomed the report, and Carolyn McCall, its chief executive, said the airline 
"agrees that expansion at Heathrow will provide the greatest passenger and economic benefits, including lower 
fares by opening up the airport to increased competition."
2nd UPDATE: Trade Groups, easyJet Welcome 3rd Heathrow Runway Backing
"Expansion at Heathrow must be delivered sustainably. Local noise and environmental impacts need to be 
addressed and easyJet supports the commission’s recommendations on these issues. We now urge the 
government to quickly proceed with the commission’s recommendation and start the work to increase the aviation 
capacity for the UK," McCall added.
But Kenny Jacobs, the chief marketing officer Ryanair, offer a more radical solution to the capacity squeeze. Jacobs 
said in response to the commission's report that the Irish budget carrier backs an even bigger three-runway 
solution, by which Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted would be able to build three competing runways and which 
would involve politicians being taken out of the process.
Jacobs said the company thinks this would solve the capacity issues facing the South East for the next century and 
would allow competition between the airports to deliver this capacity efficiently.
"Ryanair believes that the proposed Heathrow runway - which won't be delivered for 10 or 15 years - won't solve 
the runway capacity crisis in the South East," Jacobs said. "It remains a fact that additional runways in Stansted 
and Gatwick can and will be delivered much earlier than any Heathrow third runway."
Shares in easyJet were up 4.0% on Wednesday afternoon, while Ryanair shares were up 3.8%. Shares in 
International Consolidated Airlines Group,  the owner of British Airways, which is based at Heathrow but which has 
yet to make a comment on the commission's report, were up 2.4%.

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - After moving sharply higher at the open, stocks have seen some further upside 
over the course of the trading day on Monday. With the strength on the day, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has reached a 
new record intraday high.
In recent trading, the major averages have pulled back off their highs, but they remain firmly positive. The Dow is up 
139.93 points or 0.8% at 18,155.88, the Nasdaq is up 40.22 points or 0.8% at 5,157.23 and the S&P 500 is up 
16.92 points or 0.8% at 2,126.91.
The strength on Wall Street largely reflects optimism that Greece will finally reach an agreement with its 
international creditors.
Greece has reportedly submitted a new proposal that could lead to progress and allow the debt-laden country to 
avoid a default.
Jonathan Loynes, Chief European Economist at Capital Economics, said, "The optimism stems from new proposals 
advanced by Greece over the weekend, which reportedly cross the previous 'red lines' of pension cuts and VAT 
rises."
"In exchange, Greece's creditors have apparently indicated that they are prepared to meet the Greek government's 
demands for some sort of debt relief to be included in an extension to the current bailout or a third program," he 
added.
Adding to the optimism, Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem described the Greek proposal as a positive step 
and said an agreement could be reached later this week.
The latest signs of progress come as Greece has indicated that it will be unable to make a 1.5 billion euro payment 
to the International Monetary Fund at the end of the month without further aid.

Positive sentiment has also been generated by a report from the National Association of Realtors showing that 
existing home sales jumped to their highest level in almost six years in May.
The report said existing home sales surged up by 5.1% to an annual rate of 5.35 million in May from an upwardly 
revised 5.09 million in April.
Economists had expected existing home sales to climb to an annual rate of 5.25 million from the 5.04 million 
originally reported for the previous month.

Brussels (Alliance News) - In the first meeting of its kind, five chief executives from Europe's biggest airlines met 
Wednesday to lobby EU lawmakers to increase competition at European airports, lower taxes and limit labour 
strikes.
"Europe needs a common strategy and comprehensive plan for our aviation industry," Carolyn McCall, chief 
executive of easyJet, told journalists after the meeting. "It's overdue."
The executives of Air France-KLM, easyJet PLC, International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC, which oversees 
British Airways, Lufthansa AG and Ryanair Holdings PLC said they would form a new association aimed at 
representing their interests at the EU-level by October, in order to take their concerns to EU Transport 
Commissioner Violeta Bulc.
Cutting airport costs, making airspace more efficient - including avoiding labour strikes such as those by air traffic 
controllers that have grounded hundreds of passengers in the last year - and reducing passenger taxes were 
among the executives' key demands.
"It is really unacceptable that any of us operate in an airport with a single ground handler," McCall said. "It's very 
bad for customers, it's very bad for competition. The EU has to take that onboard because it is there to protect 
consumers and increase competition."
Carsten Spohr, an executive with German carrier Lufthansa, and Air France-KLM executive Alexandre de Juniac 
said one of the priorities was lowering the costs of airport security. Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary called for limiting 
labour strikes, including encouraging binding arbitration.
"The market should be allowed to operate," said International Airlines Group executive Willie Walsh. "It is in the 
interest of our customers that we have a more efficient industry."

2nd UPDATE: Ryanair To Fight On Over Forced Aer Lingus Stake Sale
2nd UPDATE: Ryanair To Fight On Over Forced Aer Lingus Stake Sale

LONDON (Alliance News) - The UK anti-trust regulator Thursday issued a final order requiring Ryanair Holdings 
PLC to sell down its 29.8% stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus Group PLC to 5%, boosting International Consolidated 
Airlines Group PLC's chances of successfully acquiring Aer Lingus although potentially also significantly delaying 
that outcome.
The final ruling should mark the culmination of a long-running battle between the regulator and Ryanair, which has 
several times said it should not be required to sell down the stake it had built up when trying to buy Aer Lingus itself 
three times. 
However, Ryanair said Thursday that it will appeal the regulator's "ridiculous" ruling to the Competition Appeal 
Tribunal, and will also seek permission to appeal the "unsustainable" 2013 report that contained the CMA's initial 
arguments to the UK Supreme Court, which could substantially delay the takeover of Aer Lingus by IAG if the 
Supreme Court agrees to hear the appeal. Ryanair has already had an appeal over the 2013 decision turned down 
by the Competition Appeal Tribunal and then the High Court, a process that took almost two years.
The battle with the UK regulator has become a matter of pride for Ireland's Ryanair and its forthright Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary, but is also a factor in Ryanair's part in IAG's attempt to acquire Aer Lingus. If Ryanair 
had been allowed license to decide the fate of its Aer Lingus stake itself, it could have used that as leverage to try 
and extract a higher offer from IAG, or to get concessions like landing and takeoff slots for Ryanair. However, the 
Competition and Markets Authority's decision means it doesn't have that leverage as it has to sell the stake anyway.
The CMA had released a provisional decision in April saying it still expected Ryanair to comply with its initial order 
to sell down the Aer Lingus stake, after Ryanair said IAG's bid for Aer Lingus had changed the situation. The 
regulator disagreed. It has now confirmed that sale order.
Ryanair was typically forthright in its response, calling the CMA's decision "ridiculous" and "manifestly wrong" and 
saying it "flies in the face" of the current IAG takeover offer for Aer Lingus.
2nd UPDATE: Ryanair To Fight On Over Forced Aer Lingus Stake Sale
"When the only basis for the CMA's original divestment ruling was that Ryanair's minority shareholding was or 
would prevent other airlines making an offer for Aer Lingus, the recent offers by IAG for Aer Lingus totally disprove 
and undermine the bogus theories and invented evidence on which the CMA based its untenable divestment 
ruling," Ryanair said.
"Simon Polito and his group were unable to establish any consumer harm arising from Ryanair's minority stake in 
Aer Lingus and instead resorted to speculating (in the CMA's August 2013 report) that Ryanair's 29.8% 
shareholding would deter other airlines from merging with or bidding for Aer Lingus. IAG's current offer for Aer 
Lingus proves that the the CMA's invented theory of harm was hopelessly wrong, and is now unsustainable given 
that the circumstances have manifestly changed, and accordingly the divestment remedy must be revoked in light 
of this compelling evidence," it added.
IAG has made a EUR1.4 billion offer for Aer Lingus, and has won the backing of the Irish government for the deal, 
the Irish flag carrier's other major shareholder with a 25% stake. That meant the success of the bid is dependent on 
Ryanair accepting the deal.
"IAG's bid for Aer Lingus is dependent on securing Ryanair's agreement to sell its shareholding. This recent 
development illustrates that Ryanair can decide whether a bid for its major competitor on UK/Irish routes succeeds 
or fails," Simon Polito, chairman of the Ryanair/Aer Lingus inquiry group at the CMA said as he explained the 
regulator's decision.        
"This concern was an important part of our decision to require Ryanair to reduce its shareholding. It's not good for 
competition when one company holds such an influence over the future of one of its major competitors," he added.
"Although at this point Ryanair has yet to decide whether to sell its shares to IAG, we need to ensure that, whatever 
happens in relation to this particular transaction, Ryanair's ability to hold sway over Aer Lingus is removed," he said.         
The regulator said it would ensure that the implementation of Ryanair's share sale order "interacts effectively" with 
the IAG bid process for Aer Lingus and with the European Commission's assessment of the bid. 
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary reiterated that Europe's largest low-cost airline would look at IAG's offer 
for Aer Lingus when it received the formal offer document, and conceded that the IAG offer was at a significant 
premium to the bids that Ryanair had made for Aer Lingus. Its last attempt to buy the Irish flag carrier was two years 
ago, a deal that was blocked by the European Commission and rejected by the Irish government. 
It was ordered by the CMA's predecessor, the Competition Commission, to sell down its Aer Lingus stake shortly 
after that, before IAG made a takeover offer for the airline. It had appealed that decision to the UK High Court and 
lost in April of this year.
However, O'Leary said Thursday that Ryanair's fight with the regulator was a separate issue to whether or not to 
accept the IAG bid for Aer Lingus and one he was determined to pursue. 
The CEO then called on Polito to correct the "false and misleading claims" that IAG's bid for Aer Lingus is 
dependent on securing Ryanair's agreement to sell its shareholding and that Ryanair can decide on whether a bid 
for its major competitor on UK/Irish routes succeeds or fails.
Ryanair pointed out that IAG's offer for Aer Lingus has already received public acceptances from both the Irish 
Government and Middle East airline Etihad, which own approximately 30% of Aer Lingus between them. It correctly 
pointed out that if IAG gets acceptances from Aer Lingus shareholders holding more than 50.1% of its voting 
shares, "it is clear that there is nothing Ryanair can do to prevent IAG acquiring control of Aer Lingus". 
"No 30% shareholder can block a takeover bid if more than 50% of other shareholders accept it," Ryanir said.
However, this argument missed a key point that the CMA had also raised in its explanation for the final decision. 
IAG wants to buy Aer Lingus outright, and could only force remaining minority shareholders to sell if it gets more 
than a 75% stake in the airline, which would be impossible if Ryanair kept its stake. 
2nd UPDATE: Ryanair To Fight On Over Forced Aer Lingus Stake Sale
"It is clear that the timing of IAG's bid has been influenced by the prospect of Ryanair being forced to sell the 
majority of its shareholding. IAG has said that it would not be interested in acquiring any airline with a significant 
minority investor. The conditional nature of IAG's bid is consistent with this and our original assessment that 
Ryanair's presence was likely to deter other airlines from entering into, pursuing or concluding combinations with 
Aer Lingus," Polito said in the CMA statement.
Aer Lingus noted the CMA's announcement, and its pledge to ensure that the implementation interacts effectively 
with the IAG takeover offer and the European Commission's assessment of the offer. 
Ryanair shares were up 1.1% at EUR11.87 in London Thursday morning, while Aer Lingus was flat at EUR2.42 and 
IAG was up 0.7% at 526.00 pence.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The UK anti-trust regulator Thursday issued a final order requiring Ryanair Holdings 
PLC to sell down its 29.8% stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus Group PLC to 5%, boosting International Consolidated 
Airlines Group PLC's chances of successfully acquiring Aer Lingus although potentially also significantly delaying 
that outcome.
The final ruling should mark the culmination of a long-running battle between the regulator and Ryanair, which has 
several times said it should not be required to sell down the stake it had built up when trying to buy Aer Lingus itself 
three times. However, Ryanair said Thursday that it will appeal the regulator's "ridiculous" ruling to the Competition 
Appeal Tribunal, and will also seek permission to appeal the "unsustainable" 2013 report that contained the CMA's 
initial arguments to the UK supreme court, which could delay the takeover of Aer Lingus by IAG.
The Competition and Markets Authority had released a provisional decision in April saying it still expected Ryanair 
to comply with its initial order to sell down the Aer Lingus stake, after Ryanair said IAG's bid for Aer Lingus had 
changed the situation. The regulator disagreed. It has now confirmed that sale order.
Ryanair was typically forthright in its response, calling the CMA's decision "ridiculous" and "manifestly wrong" and 
saying it "flies in the face" of the current IAG takeover offer for Aer Lingus.
"When the only basis for the CMA's original divestment ruling was that Ryanair's minority shareholding was or 
would prevent other airlines making an offer for Aer Lingus, the recent offers by IAG for Aer Lingus totally disprove 
and undermine the bogus theories and invented evidence on which the CMA based its untenable divestment 
ruling," Ryanair said.
"Simon Polito and his group were unable to establish any consumer harm arising from Ryanair's minority stake in 
Aer Lingus and instead resorted to speculating (in the CMA's August 2013 report) that Ryanair's 29.8% 
shareholding would deter other airlines from merging with or bidding for Aer Lingus. IAG's current offer for Aer 
Lingus proves that the the CMA's invented theory of harm was hopelessly wrong, and is now unsustainable given 
UPDATE: IAG Bid For Aer Lingus Boosted As UK Regulator Confirms Ryanair Order
that the circumstances have manifestly changed, and accordingly the divestment remedy must be revoked in light 
of this compelling evidence," it added.
IAG has made a EUR1.4 billion offer for Aer Lingus, and has won the backing of the Irish government for the deal, 
the Irish flag carrier's other major shareholder with a 25% stake. That meant the success of the bid is dependent on 
Ryanair accepting the deal.
"IAG's bid for Aer Lingus is dependent on securing Ryanair's agreement to sell its shareholding. This recent 
development illustrates that Ryanair can decide whether a bid for its major competitor on UK/Irish routes succeeds 
or fails," Simon Polito, chairman of the Ryanair/Aer Lingus inquiry group at the CMA said as he explained the 
regulator's decision.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airline Group's EUR1.4 billion takeover bid for Aer Lingus 
got a boost Thursday, although it could also be delayed for a substantial amount of time, after the UK antitrust 
regulator made a final order that Ryanair Holdings sell down its stake in the Irish flag carrier.
The Competition and Markets Authority said Ryanair must now sell its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus down to 5%, after 
deciding that IAG's bid for Aer Lingus hadn't changed the circumstances of its initial ruling that Ryanair must sell 
down the stake, as Rynair had argued.
The final ruling should mark the culmination of a two-year battle between the regulator and Ryanair, which built up 
its stake when it tried to acquire Aer Lingus itself. It was blocked by regulators and failed to get the acceptance of 
the Irish government, which has a 25% Aer Lingus stake. The Irish government has accepted IAG's offer for Aer 
Lingus.
However, the battle with the UK regulator has become a matter of pride for Ireland's Ryanair and its forthright Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary, who said the airline will be appealing the CMA's "ridiculous" and "manifestly wrong" 
decision that "flies in the face" of the current IAG takeover offer for Aer Lingus. That appeal could delay the 
outcome of IAG's bid.
If Ryanair had been allowed license to decide the fate of its Aer Lingus stake itself, it could have used that as 
leverage to extract a higher offer from IAG, or to get concessions like landing and takeoff slots for Ryanair. 
However, the CMA's decision means it doesn't have that leverage as it has to sell the stake anyway.
O'Leary reiterated that Europe's largest low-cost airline would look at IAG's offer for Aer Lingus when it received the 
formal offer document, and conceded that the IAG offer was at a significant premium to the bids that Ryanair had 
made for Aer Lingus, but he said the battle with the CMA was a separate issue and one that he's determined to 
pursue.
LONDON MIDDAY BRIEFING: Ryanair To Fight On Over Aer Lingus Stake
Royal Mail is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 after the UK government raised GBP750 million by selling a further 
15% stake in Royal Mail for 550 pence a share, significantly more than it got per share when it first floated the mail 
operator in the criticized initial public offering nearly two years ago. 
The Department for Business, Innovation & Skills had announced Wednesday that it would be selling half its 
remaining 30% stake in Royal Mail in an accelerated bookbuild. The sale means the UK government is left with 
149.9 million Royal Mail shares, a 15% stake. Chancellor Osborne later said a 1% stake of the remaining 15% 
would be gifted to the company's staff. Staff took a 10% stake in the initial IPO.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, meanwhile, is amongst the best performers in the bluechip index, after Osborne also 
kicked off the return of the bank to the markets.
The government is to begin selling the UK's 80% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland Group after both the Bank of 
England and banking group Rothschild signalled that the time has come to initiate the lender's return to full private 
ownership. 
Delivering his annual speech at Mansion House in London on Wednesday evening, Osborne said that kicking off 
the sale of the government's stake six years since completing the injection of GBP45.5 billion into the bank is the 
"right thing" to do.

Chancellor George Osborne did not include explicit reference to the bank levy imposed on banks in 2011 in his 
Mansion House speech. The levy has been seen to have played a part in HSBC Holdings' decision to review 
whether to relocate its global headquarters from London, although the Chancellor said that making Britain the "best 
place" for the headquarters of European and global banks is in the national interest. The levy has been seen to 
disproportionately affect HSBC and fellow Asia-focused lender Standard Chartered as it is imposed on global,

senior staff at the central bank. In his Mansion House speech, Carney said that from next year, senior managers of

Home Retail Group reported a drop in total sales in both its Argos and Homebase businesses in the first quarter of 
its financial year, but a rise in like-for-like sales in Homebase as it continues with its 'Transformation Plan' and 
store-closure programme. The owner of the Argos electronics and general merchandise chain and the Homebase 
DIY chain said that total sales in Argos declined 2.6% to GBP846 million in the 13 weeks to May 30, as like-for-like 
sales fell 3.9%. Total Homebase sales decreased 1.6% to GBP438 million, but like-for-like revenue was up 5.4% in

corporate insurer of Allianz Group, with crisis management services. First Property Group is up after it reported 
strong increases in assets, earnings and returns due to a strong performance from its fund management business 
and the purchase of properties in Poland and Romania for its group properties portfolio. Nektan is up after it 
received approval for both a software and gaming licence for the UK market from the UK Gambling Commission. 
Sirius Minerals is also up, with WH Ireland retaining its positive stance on the potash developer after reports 
commissioned by the North York Moors National Park Authority to review Sirius' proposal for its York potash project 
were published on its website. Boxhill Technologies is up after it said that profitability in the third quarter of its

The World Bank downgraded its global growth outlook as developing countries face a series of tough challenges in 
2015. The global economy is expected to expand 2.8% instead of 3% estimated in January, the bank said in its 
Global Economic Prospects report. For next year, growth is forecast to improve to 3.3% and then 3.2% in 2017. 
Developing countries are projected to grow by 4.4% this year, with a likely rise to 5.2% in 2016, and 5.4% in 2017. 
However, in high-income countries, recovery is gaining momentum, as growth in the euro area and Japan picks up 
and the US continues to expand, despite a weak start to the year, the lender said.

House prices in the UK are expected to move higher over the next three months, the latest survey from the Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed, with an index score of +34. That touches a nine-month high, and it's up 
from +32 in April, although it was shy of expectations for +36. The increase in prices was the natural result of the 
Conservative Party's electoral victory last month, RICS said.

The negotiations over Greece's bailout should be stepped up, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said early Thursday 
after crunch talks with his German and French counterparts, held amid growing fears that Athens could soon run 
out of money. "We have decided to intensify the discussions so that the remaining differences can be bridged, so 
that we reach a solution in the near future," Tsipras said after the two-hour meeting with German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. It was the second time in three weeks that Tsipras, Merkel and 
Hollande met to discuss Greece's economic woes.
----------
German Chancellor Merkel's government may be satisfied with Greece committing to at least one economic reform 
sought by creditors to open the door to bailout funds, Bloomberg reported Wednesday citing two people familiar 
with Germany’s position. The report said that while the German government still insist on a package of steps that 
includes higher taxes, state asset sales and less generous retirement benefits, they may settle for a clear 
commitment by the Greek government to a measure up front to unlock aid, said the people, who asked not to be 
identified discussing the government’s negotiating stance.

S&P Ratings Services cut its long-term sovereign credit rating on Greece to 'CCC' from 'CCC+', citing the likelihood

Russian President Vladimir Putin denied that his country had become an international outcast after being expelled 
from the Group of Eight and slapped with sanctions over its actions in Ukraine. Putin spoke during an official trip to 
Italy and the Vatican. He first met Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and visited the EXPO world fair in Milan, and 
later travelled to Rome to meet Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Pope Francis. "You asked about our 
relations with the G7. We have no relations with the G7," Putin said in a press conference with Renzi. "We had an 
alternative point of view but our partners have decided they do not need this alternative point of view," he added.

China's industrial production growth improved slightly in May, just above economists' expectations, while retail sales 
growth accelerated as expected, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics showed. Industrial production grew 
6.1% year-over-year in May, following a 5.9% gain in April. Economists had expected a 6.0% climb for the month. 
The statistical office also said retail sales surged a price-adjusted 10.1% in May, in line with consensus estimate, 
slightly faster than previous month's 10.0% hike. In March, sales had risen 10.2%.

South Korea's central bank lowered a key interest rate to 1.5% on Thursday, citing concerns about the impact of 
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, reports said, as the number of confirmed infections continued to rise. "The 
trend of decline in exports has accelerated and...consumption, which had been showing a recovery, appears to 
have contracted since the outbreak of MERS," the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea wrote in its 
policy decision, according to Yonhap News Agency. "The downside risks to the domestic growth path forecast in 
April have expanded." The bank has made four rate cuts since August, and the current rate is a record low, Yonhap 
reported.

Following recent setbacks in the fight against Islamic State militants, the White House announced that President

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
The UK anti-trust regulator issued a final order requiring Ryanair Holdings to sell down its 29.8% stake in Irish rival 
Aer Lingus Group to 5%, boosting International Consolidated Airlines Group's chances of successfully acquiring Aer 
Lingus although potentially also significantly delaying that outcome. The final ruling should mark the culmination of 
a long-running battle between the Competition and Markets Authority and Ryanair, which has several times said it 
should not be required to sell down the stake it had built up when trying to buy Aer Lingus itself three times. 
However, Ryanair said that it will appeal the regulator's "ridiculous" ruling to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and 
will also seek permission to appeal the "unsustainable" 2013 report that contained the CMA's initial arguments to 
the UK supreme court, which could delay the takeover of Aer Lingus by IAG.
----------
Chancellor George Osborne is to begin selling the UK's 80% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland Group after both the 
Bank of England and banking group Rothschild signalled that the time has come to initiate the lender's return to full 
private ownership. Delivering his annual speech at Mansion House in London on Wednesday evening, Osborne 
said that kicking off the sale of the government's stake six years since completing the injection of GBP45.5 billion 
into the bank is the "right thing" to do. The Chancellor's speech had been highly anticipated by a wide range of 
stakeholders, including bankers, investors and taxpayers, who had been waiting to hear about his plans for the RBS 
stake and the bank levy imposed on banks in 2011. While Osborne provided details about selling the RBS stake, 
his speech did not include explicit reference to the levy, which has been seen to have played a part in HSBC 
Holdings's decision to review whether to relocate its global headquarters from London, although the Chancellor said 
that making Britain the "best place" for the headquarters of European and global banks is in the national interest. 
The levy has been seen to disproportionately affect HSBC and fellow Asia-focused lender Standard Chartered as it 
is imposed on global, rather than just UK, balance sheets.

----------
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that all firms active in financial transaction markets, including dealers 
and asset managers, should ensure that senior managers are held directly accountable for failures in their areas of 
responsibility, and the core principles of the new regime governing this in banks and insurers will also apply to 
senior staff at the central bank. In his Mansion House speech, also Wednesday, Carney said that from next year, 
senior managers of banks and insurers will be held directly accountable for failures in their areas of responsibility 
and this should be extended to all firms active in so-called Fixed Income Clearing Corporation markets, including 
dealers and asset managers.
----------
The UK government said Thursday it has raised GBP750 million by selling a further 15% stake in Royal Mail for 550 
pence a share, significantly more than it got per share when it first floated the mail operator in a criticized initial 
public offering nearly two years ago. The Department for Business, Innovation & Skills had announced Wednesday 
that it would be selling half its remaining 30% stake in Royal Mail in an accelerated bookbuild. The sale means the 
UK government is left with 149.9 million Royal Mail shares, a 15% stake. Chancellor Osborne later said a 1% stake 
of the remaining 15% would be gifted to the company's staff. Staff took a 10% stake in the initial IPO.
----------
British American Tobacco said it has successfully priced a US dollar denominated issue of notes, raising proceeds 
of approximately USD4.5 billion that will be used to help fund its decision to maintain its stake in Reynolds 
American and could also be used to pay down debt. BAT has said a year ago that it would invest USD4.7 billion to 
maintain its existing 42% interest in the enlarged Reynolds American group, following the acquisition of Lorillard by 
Reynolds in a deal valued at USD27.4 billion. Last month, the Reynolds-Lorillard deal was approved by the US 
Federal Trade Commission.
----------
Home Retail Group reported a drop in total sales in both its Argos and Homebase businesses in the first quarter of 
its financial year, but a rise in like-for-like sales in Homebase as it continues with its 'Transformation Plan' and 
store-closure programme. The owner of the Argos electronics and general merchandise chain and the Homebase 
DIY chain said that total sales in Argos declined 2.6% to GBP846 million in the 13 weeks to May 30, as like-for-like 
sales fell 3.9%. Total Homebase sales decreased 1.6% to GBP438 million, but like-for-like revenue was up 5.4% in 
the period.
----------
PZ Cussons said the group's performance in its recently-ended financial year was in line with expectations, as it did 
well in the UK, Australia and Indonesia, and as trading in Nigeria is stabilising. The maker of bath products Imperial 
Leather and Original Source said that in the year to May 31, all brands performed well in the UK driven by a 
significant renovation and innovation programme, while performance in the smaller markets of Poland and Greece 
was in line with expectations.
----------
Ophir Energy saw its shares rise after it said a new independent reserves report had confirmed its has over 1 billion 
barrels of oil equivalent in its reserves, which it claimed is one of the largest in the European mid-cap sector. The 
independent reserves and resources reports support its previous management estimates, the company said, with 
combined net 2P and 2C resources as at the end of 2014 at over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This is split 
between certified net proven and probable reserves, its 2P reserves, of 59.6 million barrels of oil equivalent, and 
certified best estimate of contingent resources, its 2C reserves, of 950.0 million barrels of oil equivalent.
----------
WS Atkins said its outlook remains positive despite challenging markets that are being affected by low oil prices and 
economic and political uncertainty, after it reported higher underlying profits for its last financial year. The project 
designer, engineer and management consultancy reported a pretax profit of GBP106.7 million for the year to end-
March, down from GBP114.2 million a year earlier.
----------
Petrofac said said it has been awarded an engineering and procurement contract, expected to be worth about 
USD900 million, by Petroleum Development Oman to provide services for its Yibal Khuff project, a field located 
approximately 350 kilmetres south west of Muscat in the Sultanate of Oman.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The World Bank downgraded its global growth outlook as developing countries face a series of tough challenges in 
2015. The global economy is expected to expand 2.8% instead of 3% estimated in January, the bank said in its 
Global Economic Prospects report. For next year, growth is forecast to improve to 3.3% and then 3.2% in 2017. 
Developing countries are projected to grow by 4.4% this year, with a likely rise to 5.2% in 2016, and 5.4% in 2017. 
However, in high-income countries, recovery is gaining momentum, as growth in the euro area and Japan picks up 
and the US continues to expand, despite a weak start to the year, the lender said.
----------
House prices in the UK are expected to move higher over the next three months, the latest survey from the Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed, with an index score of +34. That touches a nine-month high, and it's up 
from +32 in April, although it was shy of expectations for +36. The increase in prices was the natural result of the 
Conservative Party's electoral victory last month, RICS said.
----------
The negotiations over Greece's bailout should be stepped up, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said early Thursday 
after crunch talks with his German and French counterparts, held amid growing fears that Athens could soon run 
out of money. "We have decided to intensify the discussions so that the remaining differences can be bridged, so 
that we reach a solution in the near future," Tsipras said after the two-hour meeting with German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. It was the second time in three weeks that Tsipras, Merkel and 
Hollande met to discuss Greece's economic woes.
----------
German Chancellor Merkel's government may be satisfied with Greece committing to at least one economic reform 
sought by creditors to open the door to bailout funds, Bloomberg reported Wednesday citing two people familiar 
with Germany’s position. The report said that while the German government still insist on a package of steps that 
includes higher taxes, state asset sales and less generous retirement benefits, they may settle for a clear 
commitment by the Greek government to a measure up front to unlock aid, said the people, who asked not to be 
identified discussing the government’s negotiating stance.
----------
S&P Ratings Services cut its long-term sovereign credit rating on Greece to 'CCC' from 'CCC+', citing the likelihood 
of the nation defaulting on its commercial debt within the next 12 months in the absence of a bailout deal with its 
official creditors.
----------
Russian President Vladimir Putin denied that his country had become an international outcast after being expelled 
from the Group of Eight and slapped with sanctions over its actions in Ukraine. Putin spoke during an official trip to 
Italy and the Vatican. He first met Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and visited the EXPO world fair in Milan, and 
TOP NEWS: Ryanair To Appeal Against "Ridiculous" UK Regulator Ruling
later travelled to Rome to meet Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Pope Francis. "You asked about our 
relations with the G7. We have no relations with the G7," Putin said in a press conference with Renzi. "We had an 
alternative point of view but our partners have decided they do not need this alternative point of view," he added.
----------
China's industrial production growth improved slightly in May, just above economists' expectations, while retail sales 
growth accelerated as expected, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics showed. Industrial production grew 
6.1% year-over-year in May, following a 5.9% gain in April. Economists had expected a 6.0% climb for the month. 
The statistical office also said retail sales surged a price-adjusted 10.1% in May, in line with consensus estimate, 
slightly faster than previous month's 10.0% hike. In March, sales had risen 10.2%.
----------
South Korea's central bank lowered a key interest rate to 1.5% on Thursday, citing concerns about the impact of 
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, reports said, as the number of confirmed infections continued to rise. "The 
trend of decline in exports has accelerated and...consumption, which had been showing a recovery, appears to 
have contracted since the outbreak of MERS," the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea wrote in its 
policy decision, according to Yonhap News Agency. "The downside risks to the domestic growth path forecast in 
April have expanded." The bank has made four rate cuts since August, and the current rate is a record low, Yonhap 
reported.
----------
Following recent setbacks in the fight against Islamic State militants, the White House announced that President 
Barack Obama has approved sending up to 450 additional US troops to Iraq. The additional US military personnel 
will train, advise, and assist the Iraqi security forces at Taqaddum military base in eastern Anbar province

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum says its consumer survey for the second quarter of 2015 has shown a clear 
change in trend in perceived value for money for business air travel. 
Analyst Gerald Khoo says there has been a significant shift in the pattern of results from its business airline value 
for money question as British Airways has overtaken easyJet as the preferred choice for value money when flying 
on business.
"EasyJet has long been established as the clear favourite in this category, ahead of British Airways. However, this 
survey has shown a clear reversal of the top two positions, with British Airways now top," he says.  
However, easyJet remains the comfortable leader on overall airline value for money, with Ryanair's recent 
improvements pausing, the analyst says.
Liberum conducts a quarterly survey of 1,000 representative consumers in the UK. In this quarter's analysis, 
Liberum focuses on the data most pertinent to the airlines. 
Amongst other questions, the broker asks in the survey which airline offers the best value for money in business 
travel. 
The analyst says after "an alarmingly weak reading" in the first quarter, the overseas travel indicator has shown a 
marked recovery. 
"Although it has not returned to quite the same levels seen through most of 2014, with 15% of consumers saying 
they expect to take more trips compared with the 18-20% range seen last year, we now suspect that the first 
quarter reading was a bit of an aberration, albeit with some underlying softening," says Khoo. 
Liberum retains a Buy stance on British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group, Ryanair and 
easyJet. The broker keeps price targets of 521 pence for IAG, EUR11.66 for Ryanair and 1,572p for easyJet.

Wednesday, IAG is trading up 0.2% at 519.31p, easyJet is up 1.2% at 1,581 and Ryanair Holdings is up 0.5% at 
EUR11.65.

Aer Lingus Traffic Improves In May, With Load Factor Also Stronger
Aer Lingus Traffic Improves In May, With Load Factor Also Stronger

LONDON (Alliance News) - Aer Lingus Group PLC on Friday said its traffic in May increased on the back of a 
recovery in its short-haul performance and better long-haul figures.
The Irish flag carrier, which reports traffic figures measured in revenue passenger kilometres, said traffic rose by 
6.8% in the month to 1.7 billion revenue passenger kilometres, from 1.59 billion a year earlier. It marks an 
improvement on its April numbers, when traffic fell 3.6% on the year, as a 7.5% drop in short-haul was only partially 
offset by a 1.5% increase for long-haul. In May, short-haul traffic rose by 2.6% on the year before, while long-haul 
increased by 12%.
Revenue passengers are those that pay commercial fares, and exclude free staff flights and free children's flights. 
Revenue passenger kilometres include the kilometres flown, by stages, and is an attempt to measure sales volume.
The airline also saw an improvement in its load factor in the month, up by 1.7 percentage points to 80.4% from 
78.7% a year earlier.
Aer Lingus is currently the subject of a EUR1.4 billion takeover bid from International Consolidated Airlines Group, 
the owner of British Airways, in a deal which has now received backing from the Irish government. IAG still needs to 
secure the support of budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC, which owns a 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said its traffic grew year-on-
year in May and its load factor improved.
Ryanair said its traffic grew by 16% in the month to 9.5 million customers, up from 8.2 million a year earlier. The 
company's rolling annual traffic to May increased by 13% to 93.1 million customers.
The load factor for the airline also improved in the month, up by seven percentage points to 92% from 85% a year 
ago.
"Ryanair's May traffic grew by 16% to 9.5m customers, while our load factor jumped by 7% points to 92%, thanks to 
our lower fares, our stronger forward bookings and the continuing success of our "Always Getting Better" customer 
experience improvement programme, which continues to deliver better than expected load factors on our 
significantly expanded summer schedule," said Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Cantor Fitzgerald lifts Ryanair's price target to EUR13.5 from EUR12.0, retaining its 
Buy stance and upgrading its forecasts, after the Irish budget carrier reported "solid" 2015 earnings and guided to 
10% net growth in net profit in 2016.
Last week, Ryanair said its net profit for the financial year to the end of March beat its upgraded guidance on the 
back of stronger revenue and higher customer numbers and as its load factor improved. It reported a profit after tax 
for the year to March 31 of EUR867 million, up 66% from the EUR523 million. Meanwhile, revenue rose to EUR5.65 
billion from EUR5.04 billion made in the previous year.
Cantor analyst Robin Byde says the company's guidance for 2016 may prove conservative, with summer bookings 
already 4% ahead of last year and many costs fixed or predictable. 
"Growth plans will focus on expansion at primary airports (Brussels, Lisbon, Rome and Berlin), yield improvement 
from 'Always Getting Better' service upgrades and more business travel in the mix," says the Cantor analyst.
Byde believes winter is again likely to be a key battleground. "Winter yields are again likely to come under pressure, 
but Ryanair is clearly more price-maker than taker on most routes." 
Therefore, the broker lifts its forecasts for 2016 and 2017 by an average of 4%, mainly due to lower fuel costs, 
noting that Ryanair "could soon receive EUR400 million for its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus Group, assuming 
International Consolidated Airlines Group offer is accepted." 
IAG's offer, which was approved by the Irish government last week, values the Irish flag carrier at EUR1.4 billion in 
total. 
Cantor expects Ryanair's revenue for 2016 to be EUR6.0 billion with a pretax profit of EUR994 million. Meanwhile, 
the broker estimates 2017 revenue to be EUR6.4 billion and pretax profit to be EUR1.0 billion.

Ryanair Holding shares are up 0.4% Monday morning at EUR11.61, while Aer Lingus is up 0.1% at EUR2.44 and 
IAG is up 1.4% at 561.50 pence.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Societe Generale reiterates its Buy rating for International Consolidated Airlines Group, 
saying it is confident that the British Airways owner's bid to acquire Irish air carrier Aer Lingus would be good for 
both companies. 
SocGen analyst Kishore Samanuri says while he does not have a specific timetable for the deal, he remains 
comfortable with the offer made by IAG for Aer Lingus and expects the deal to be value accretive to both Aer Lingus 
and IAG. 
"We believe the underpinning factor for IAG's Aer Lingus acquisition is to leverage Dublin (and Shannon) airport's 
strategic advantages (geographic location and US customs pre-clearance services at the airports) to capture 
European transfer traffic on the transatlantic route," the analyst says. 
IAG said Thursday its EUR2.55 per share offer for Aer Lingus is its final one and will not be raised. The deal had 
moved a step closer on Tuesday after the Irish government gave its backing to the EUR1.4 billion offer, though this 
still needs to be passed through an Irish parliamentary vote.
The other step IAG still has to overcome is securing the support of Ryanair Holdings, the budget carrier which holds 
a 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus.
SocGen's Samanuri expects the market to continue its positive reaction to the deal.
SocGen has a 750.00 pence price target for IAG.
IAG is one of the best performers in the FTSE 100 Thursday, trading up 1.9% at 572.68p. Aer Lingus trades flat  at 
EUR2.441.

Germany rejected Athens' claims that it was close to a deal with its international creditors as the world's top 
financial officials gathered in Dresden for a meeting overshadowed by the Greek debt crisis. Global markets 
rebounded on Wednesday ahead of a two-day meeting of the world's top financial officials in the eastern German 
city after Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said his cash-strapped state was on "the final stretch towards a 
positive deal". But members of the German delegation in Dresden for the meeting of the Group of Seven finance 
ministers and central bankers said: "We have not advanced much further on the matter." The German officials went

The People's Bank of China warned of deflationary pressure on the Chinese economy as it forecast consumer

saying it can expand by around 7% this year, in line with the central government's economic growth target. The

Iraqi forces recaptured towns from Islamic State fighters near militant-held Ramadi on Wednesday, a day after the 
government started an offensive to drive the jihadist militia out of Anbar province, a security official said. The 
official, a member of the Anbar police command, said security forces backed by Shiite militias and local tribes had 
regained control of Tash and Hamira south of Ramadi, cutting off Islamic State supply lines in the area. He spoke 
on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, a pro-government Shiite militia, known as the Popular Mobilization, 
announced it had advanced into the area of Nabai near Ramadi, forcing the extremists to retreat.

Pressure mounted on football's ruling body FIFA as police detained seven football officials in Zurich on US bribery 
charges, while Swiss prosecutors seized FIFA documents in a separate probe over the 2018 and 2022 World Cup 
decisions. The separate but coordinated investigations came to light shortly before the expected re-election of FIFA 
president Joseph Blatter, who seeks a fifth term on Friday. Eleven FIFA members were provisionally suspended. 
While Blatter is not a suspect in either case, the scandals during his reign since 1998 led to renewed calls for him to 
step down. European body UEFA said it was "deeply shocked" by the arrests and called for the FIFA Congress and 
election to be delayed.

movements, but said it is making good progress with its turnaround plans. The retailer reported total sales of 
GBP2.59 billion for the 13 weeks to May 2, which is a 4.6% decline on the same period the year before, but would 
have been an increase of 2.7% had exchange rates remained constant. Like-for-like sales were up 0.8% on a 
constant currency basis. Kingfisher said that retail profit in the period was GBP150 million, down 4.8% after being 
hit by GBP10 million in adverse foreign exchange movements on the translation of non-sterling profits and GBP7 
million in charges for new country development activity. Retail profit was up 1.4% at constant currencies.

pressure. This resulted in an influx of oil into the well which is of a similar nature to the Sea Lion crude.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
International Consolidated Airlines Group said its EUR2.55 per share offer for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group is 
its final offer and will not be raised. IAG moved a step closer to securing a deal to acquire Aer Lingus on Tuesday 
after the Irish government gave its backing to its EUR1.4 billion offer, though this still needs to be passed through 
an Irish parliamentary vote. The other step IAG still has to overcome is securing the support of Ryanair Holdings, 
the budget carrier which holds a 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus.
----------
The UK government said it has asked competition regulators to look at the implications on banking competition of 
the plans for Royal Bank of Scotland Group to carve out lender Williams & Glyn. The Competition and Markets 
Authority's work to assess the impact of the planned divestment on banking competition is meant to help the 
government and RBS to decide whether more could be done. The findings of the assessment will be reported in 
July, which will enable the government and RBS to consider their next actions. Currently, RBS plans to IPO the 
Williams & Glyn business in the second half of 2016.

----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK economy grew at a slower pace as initially estimated in the first quarter, second estimates published by the 
Office for National Statistics showed. Gross domestic product expanded 0.3% in the first quarter, which was weaker 
than the 0.6% seen the quarter earlier. This was the slowest growth since the fourth quarter of 2012. On a yearly 
basis, GDP growth eased to 2.4% from 3% in the previous quarter. Both sequential and annual growth figures came 
in line with the initial estimate published on April 28.
----------
UK mortgage approvals climbed for a fourth straight month in April to their highest level in ten months, data from the 
British Bankers' Association revealed. The number of loans approved for house purchase rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 42,116 from March's upwardly revised 39,203. Economists had predicted 39,300 approvals for April. The 
April outcome was possibly influenced by the introduction of the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax in Scotland, 
the BBA noted.
----------
The European Central Bank will not break rules to provide any short-term financing for Greece, ECB Governing 
Council member Ewald Nowotny said, damping speculation that the bank may loosen its stance on the cash-
strapped country. "We do not have flexibility to do, let's say, some financing outside our rules," Nowotny, who 
heads the Austrian central bank, said in an interview to the broadcaster CNBC. Acknowledging that there have 
been "ideas floating around" that the ECB may offer some interim financing, Nowotny said such a move was not 
legally possible. On Wednesday, the ECB maintained the level of Emergency Liquidity Assistance provided for 
Greek banks at EUR80.2 billion.
----------
Germany rejected Athens' claims that it was close to a deal with its international creditors as the world's top 
financial officials gathered in Dresden for a meeting overshadowed by the Greek debt crisis. Global markets 
rebounded on Wednesday ahead of a two-day meeting of the world's top financial officials in the eastern German 
city after Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said his cash-strapped state was on "the final stretch towards a 
positive deal". But members of the German delegation in Dresden for the meeting of the Group of Seven finance 
ministers and central bankers said: "We have not advanced much further on the matter." The German officials went 
on to express surprise at the statements from Athens saying that cash-strapped Greece was close to reaching a 
deal with its EU and International Monetary Fund creditors.
----------
The People's Bank of China warned of deflationary pressure on the Chinese economy as it forecast consumer 
prices will remain subdued for the year and said the growth outlook appears challenging. The Chinese central bank 
also attempted to allay concerns in the report, published on its website, about the struggling Chinese economy, 
saying it can expand by around 7% this year, in line with the central government's economic growth target. The 
annual report by the bank also saw it reiterate that will maintain a prudent monetary policy and will make timely 
adjustments to ensure that conditions in the domestic economy are "appropriate".
----------
Retail sales in Japan advanced 5.0% on year in April, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said - coming in 
at 11.562 trillion yen. That was shy of forecasts for an increase of 5.5% following the 9.7% contraction in March.
----------

Three Chinese coast guard ships on Thursday entered what Japan considers its territorial waters near a group of 
disputed islets in the East China Sea, Japanese media reported. The Japan Coast Guard spotted the three ships 
near the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands around 10 am (0100 GMT), Kyodo News agency reported. A 
Japanese patrol ship urged the Chinese ships not to approach Japan's waters, but they responded by saying the 
Chinese laws should be observed, Kyodo reported, citing Japanese coast guard officials.
----------
Talks on a far-reaching nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers might run past the self-imposed deadline 
on June 30, a senior Iranian negotiator said in Vienna. "What's important for us is a good agreement, even if it 
should take longer than the imposed deadline," Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Iranian state media 
after arriving for a new round of talks.
----------
Iraqi forces recaptured towns from Islamic State fighters near militant-held Ramadi on Wednesday, a day after the 
government started an offensive to drive the jihadist militia out of Anbar province, a security official said. The 
official, a member of the Anbar police command, said security forces backed by Shiite militias and local tribes had 
regained control of Tash and Hamira south of Ramadi, cutting off Islamic State supply lines in the area. He spoke 
on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, a pro-government Shiite militia, known as the Popular Mobilization, 
announced it had advanced into the area of Nabai near Ramadi, forcing the extremists to retreat.
----------
Pressure mounted on football's ruling body FIFA as police detained seven football officials in Zurich on US bribery 
charges, while Swiss prosecutors seized FIFA documents in a separate probe over the 2018 and 2022 World Cup 
decisions. The separate but coordinated investigations came to light shortly before the expected re-election of FIFA 
president Joseph Blatter, who seeks a fifth term on Friday. Eleven FIFA members were provisionally suspended. 
While Blatter is not a suspect in either case, the scandals during his reign since 1998 led to renewed calls for him to 
step down. European body UEFA said it was "deeply shocked" by the arrests and called for the FIFA Congress and 
election to be delayed.

regained control of Tash and Hamira south of Ramadi, cutting off Islamic State supply lines in the area. He spoke 
on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, a pro-government Shiite militia, known as the Popular Mobilization, 
announced it had advanced into the area of Nabai near Ramadi, forcing the extremists to retreat.

Pressure mounted on football's ruling body FIFA as police detained seven football officials in Zurich on US bribery 
charges, while Swiss prosecutors seized FIFA documents in a separate probe over the 2018 and 2022 World Cup 
decisions. The separate but coordinated investigations came to light shortly before the expected re-election of FIFA 
president Joseph Blatter, who seeks a fifth term on Friday. Eleven FIFA members were provisionally suspended. 
While Blatter is not a suspect in either case, the scandals during his reign since 1998 led to renewed calls for him to 
step down. European body UEFA said it was "deeply shocked" by the arrests and called for the FIFA Congress and 
election to be delayed.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are amongst the biggest risers and fallers within the main London 
indices midday Thursday.

Sports Direct International, up 4.3%. The sporting goods retailer said it will provide an update on its outlook for the

depreciation and amortisation will be in line with market expectations, while both underlying pretax profit and 
earnings per share are set to be ahead.
Kingfisher, up 3.4%. The DIY retailer reported a drop in total revenue in the first quarter of its financial year as it 
was hit by adverse currency movements, but said it is making good progress with its turnaround plans. The retailer 
reported total sales of GBP2.59 billion for the 13 weeks to May 2, which is a 4.6% decline on the same period the 
year before, but would have been an increase of 2.7% had exchange rates remained constant. The group's 
performance was boosted by a strong performance in the UK and Ireland where total sales grew 2.9%. 
International Consolidated Airlines Group, up 1.5%. The company said its EUR2.55 per share offer for Irish flag 
carrier Aer Lingus Group is its final offer and will not be raised. Aer Lingus shares are flat at EUR2.44. Aer Lingus

FTSE 250 WINNERS

PayPoint, up 6.2%. The payments services company reported higher pretax profit in its last financial year, driven by 
growth in its retail networks, and hiked its dividend on the back of the results. It said it made a GBP49.6 million 
pretax profit in the year ended March 31, compared with GBP46.0 million in the prior year. Revenue increased by 
3.0% to GBP218.5 million due to growth across its retail networks, with margins improving.
Infinis Energy, up 3.7%. The British renewable energy company said it swung to profit from a substantial loss in the 
last financial year leading the company to significantly raise its dividend, as expected, as the expansion of its wind 
farms continues to progress on schedule. 
Zoopla Property Group, up 2.6%. Jefferies has raised its price target for the online property portal to 400.00 pence 
from 269.00p, reiterating its Buy rating. Zoopla currently trades at 246.20p.

business, and tough market conditions for its SPLENDA Sucralose product. 
ICAP, down 2.3%. Numis has cut the inter-dealer broker to Sell from Hold. 
-------
AIM ALL-SHARE WINNERS
-------
Connemara Mining Co, up 23%. The company said it has received encouraging initial results from the Inishowen 
gold licences in Donegal in Ireland. Connemara said the initial results indicate quartz vein boulders up to 45 
centimetres in diameter containing robust gold grades. The gold grades obtained in the initial results range up to 
15.35 grams per tonne, the company said. 
Stellar Diamonds, up 12%. The company said it has almost reached USD1.0 million in sales during 2015 after 
completing another auction of diamonds from the Baoule project in Guinea. The company said it raised 
USD505,000 before costs in the latest auction which was held online and brought the total sales for the year to

below market expectations owing to a decision by the company to exit the display advertising sector and focus 
solely on mobile.
Northbridge Industrial Services, down 25%. The company said it sees "no reliable signs of any upturn" in the oil and 
gas sector in 2015 and said it expects to make a loss in the first half as the company slashes jobs and expenditure 
whilst closing and selling some of its operations to mitigate the difficulties in the sector.
Sareum Holdings, down 22%. The company said it has raised GBP1.4 million in a discounted share placing. 
Sareum said it had raised the funding via the issue of 577.4 million shares at 0.25 pence per share. The net 
proceeds are to be used to back its drug development programmes and for working capital. Sareum currently 
trades at 0.2795p.
Belgravium Technologies, down 15%. The mobile computing services company said it has secured a recent order 
for mobile systems but said delays to the contract will hit its first-half results.
Gable Holdings, down 10%. The non-life insurer said it swung to a loss in 2014 as it provided additional reserves to 
reduce a gap between the reserves it carries and the actuarial best estimate. Gable's pretax loss amounted to 
GBP5.4 million in 2014, a significant reversal from the GBP7.2 million pretax profit reported for the prior year.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group on Thursday said its EUR2.55 per share offer 
for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC is its final offer and will not be raised.
IAG moved a step closer to securing a deal to acquire Aer Lingus on Tuesday after the Irish government gave its 
backing to its EUR1.4 billion offer, though this still needs to be passed through an Irish parliamentary vote.
The other step IAG still has to overcome is securing the support of Ryanair Holdings PLC, the budget carrier which 
holds a 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus.

LONDON (Alliance News) - As International Consolidated Airlines Group moves closer to its EUR1.4 billion 
takeover of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group, after getting backing from the Irish government late Tuesday, Cantor 
Fitzgerald believes Ryanair Holdings will also agree to sell its stake in Aer Lingus to IAG. 
IAG's offer for Aer Lingus offer remains conditional on securing the approval of both the Irish government and 
budget carrier Ryanair, both of which hold substantial stakes in Aer Lingus, along with it securing regulatory 
approval in Europe and the UK.
"Ryanair has fully written down its holding and its average purchase price was EUR2.56. Although the company has 
good access to finance for its large new B737 aircraft orders, the additional cash would no doubt be welcome and 
may also accelerate planned buy-backs or further special dividends," says Cantor analyst Robin Byde.
The analyst continues to like Ryanair, for which it has a Buy recommendation and a EUR12.00 price target, due to 
its forecast uplift to earnings from further market share gains and improvements to service quality.
Ryanair trades down 0.2% at EUR11.46, Wednesday morning.
However, Byde reiterates a Sell rating and 520.00 pence price target for IAG, saying the integration of Aer Lingus 
may prove "distracting". The analyst also highlights the company's reliance on British Airways profits and 
unattractive valuation as other reasons for the stance. 
IAG is the best performer in the FTSE 100, trading up 1.8% at 553.5626. Aer Lingus trades up 1.9% at EUR2.44.

London (Alliance News) - Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny on Wednesday said he was confident the proposed 
EUR1.36 billion (USD1.48billion) sale of Aer Lingus to the parent company of British Airways would go ahead and 
win approval by the European Commission.
Addressing parliament following his cabinet's decision late Tuesday to sell the government's 25% stake in Aer 
Lingus to the International Airlines Group (IAG), Kenny said the deal would create jobs in Ireland.
The parliament is expected to vote on the sale on Thursday, while uncertainty remains over the position of Irish 
budget airline Ryanair, which holds a 30% stake in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair on Wednesday said it was "yet to receive any offer, and will consider any offer on its merits, if and when an 
offer is made."
Speaking to reporters in Dublin on Wednesday, Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said he expected Ryanair to 
realize "the value we are offering in terms of this takeover and will want to see the deal go through."
The government had expressed concerns that flights to and from Ireland would be reduced and jobs lost if the 
original bid from IAG, which was formed when British Airways and Spain's Iberia merged, was approved.
But Kenny on Wednesday said the government had secured guarantees from IAG over airport operations and 
routes for Aer Lingus flights after the takeover.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group has moved a step closer to sealing the 
acquisition of Aer Lingus Group PLC after the Irish flag carrier late on Tuesday once more recommended the deal 
and said the Irish government has now given its backing to the takeover.
Under the terms of the deal, IAG, the owner of British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia, will pay EUR2.55 per 
share in cash for Aer Lingus, split between a EUR2.50 cash payment and a EUR0.05 cash dividend per Aer Lingus 
share. The offer is at a premium of 40% to Aer Lingus' closing price of EUR1.82 per share on December 17, the last 
day of dealing prior to the initial offer having been made. It is also at a 77% premium to the volume-weighted 
average price of Aer Lingus shares in the six months prior to the offer being made.
Aer Lingus shares closed on Tuesday at EUR2.38. Shares in the company were up 2.4% to EUR2.43 on 
Wednesday early afternoon, while IAG shares were up 0.6% to 547.92 pence.
The offer remains conditional on securing the approval of both the Irish government and budget carrier Ryanair 
Holdings PLC, both of which hold substantial stakes in Aer Lingus, along with it securing regulatory approval in 
Europe and the UK. The Irish government, on Tuesday, however, said that it supports the takeover bid from IAG 
after it was confirmed that Aer Lingus would keep its existing slots at Heathrow airport. The Irish Parliament, the 
Dáil, still has to vote on the approval.
IAG said Aer Lingus will keep its current slots at Heathrow and will operate its current daily winter and summer 
scheduled flights between Heathrow and Dublin, Cork and Shannon for at least seven years after the acquisition. 
The Aer Lingus brand also will be maintained under the deal.
Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots and its brand were at the centre of Irish government concerns over IAG's deal. 
Speaking in March in an interview with Ireland's Newstalk Radio, Irish Transport Minister Pascal Donoghue said 
that while its talks with IAG over the Aer Lingus deal had been "positive", it was seeking more assurances on 
measures to be taken to expand employment and protect Aer Lingus' brand identity and routes.
UPDATE: IAG Close To Aer Lingus Deal As Irish Government Gives Backing
Donoghue said the Irish government at the time still held concerns about jobs and connectivity, echoing earlier 
statements made by Deputy Prime Minister Joan Burton, who also expected IAG to make further concessions to 
protect Aer Lingus' routes.
Aer Lingus itself has consistently backed the IAG takeover offer. Publishing its first-quarter results at the end of 
April, Aer Lingus said: "The board and management team of Aer Lingus strongly remain of the view that a 
combination of Aer Lingus and IAG has a compelling strategic rationale and will deliver significant benefits to all 
stakeholders in Aer Lingus."
On Tuesday, Aer Lingus Chairman Colm Barrington said: "This is a compelling transaction for Aer Lingus, its 
shareholders, its employees, its customers and for Ireland. Shareholders will realise an attractive return through the 
premium that the IAG offer provides over the level of our share price immediately prior to the announcement of 
IAG’s offer." 
The indications are that Ryanair will accept the takeover offer, based on its opposition to the ruling made by the 
Competition and Markets Authority, the UK's antitrust regulator, that it must sell down its stake in Aer Lingus from 
29.8% to 5%. Ryanair's initial request for the ruling to be overturned was made on the basis that IAG's bid for Aer 
Lingus undermines the CMA's view that Ryanair's substantial holding in Aer Lingus would deter any other 
companies from bidding for the carrier.
"Aer Lingus, Ireland and IAG would all benefit from this deal. Aer Lingus would maintain control of its brand and 
operation while gaining strength as part of a profitable and sustainable airline group in an industry that’s 
consolidating," said IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh in the Aer Lingus statement Tuesday.
"Ireland’s vital air links to Europe and North America would be enhanced, creating new jobs, with cast-iron 
guarantees on ownership of Aer Lingus’ Heathrow slots and their use on flights to Dublin, Cork and Shannon. 
Acquiring Aer Lingus would add a fourth competitive, cost effective airline to IAG, enabling us to develop our 
network using Dublin as a hub between the UK, continental Europe and North America, generating additional 
financial value for our shareholders," Walsh added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC late on Tuesday said it has moved a step closer 
to being taken over by British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group in a EUR1.4 billion deal, 
after the Irish government gave its backing to the deal.
Under the terms of the deal, IAG will pay EUR2.55 per share in cash for Aer Lingus, split between a EUR2.50 cash

The Aer Lingus brand will also be maintained under the deal.
The Financial Times had reported earlier on Tuesday that the Irish government was set to approve the deal. 
Sources close to the matter said the government believed it has won significant concessions from IAG on the future 
of Aer Lingus' take-off and landing slots at Heathrow.

LONDON (Alliance News) - London stock prices are experiencing a small rebound mid-morning Wednesday 
following heavy losses on Tuesday, as a light day of economic data sees company news steal attention, particularly 
International Consolidated Airlines Group's takeover bid for Aer Lingus. 
At mid-morning, the FTSE 100 trades up 0.7% at 6,999.29, the FTSE 250 is up 0.6% at 18,197.90, and the AIM-All 
Share is up 0.1% at 765.74.
In Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris is up 0.5%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt trades up 0.2%. 
Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group late Tuesday said it has moved a step closer to being taken over by British 
Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group in a EUR1.4 billion deal, after the Irish government gave 
its backing to the deal. 
The offer remains conditional on securing the approval of both the Irish government and budget carrier Ryanair 
Holdings, both of which hold substantial stakes in Aer Lingus, along with it securing regulatory approval in Europe 
and the UK. The Irish government, however, said it supports the takeover bid from IAG after it was confirmed that 
Aer Lingus would keep its existing slots at Heathrow airport. The Irish Parliament, the Dáil, still has to vote on the 
approval.
Cantor Fitzgerald believes that Ryanair Holdings will agree to sell its stake in Aer Lingus to IAG, as the additional 
cash from the deal could help finance its large new B737 aircraft orders and may also accelerate planned buy-
backs or further special dividends.
IAG trades up 1.4%, Aer Lingus is up 1.9%, and Ryanair shares are up 0.8%. 
Meanwhile, Imperial Tobacco Group is the best performer in the bluechip index, up 2.1%. The US Federal Trade 
Commission approved the acquisition of Lorillard by Reynolds American. As part of that US merger, Imperial 
LONDON MARKET COMMENT: Imperial Tobacco Leads As M&A News Lifts Stocks
Tobacco previously had agreed to acquire from the pair a portfolio of US cigarette brands, e-cigarette brand blu, 
and Lorillard's cigarette factory and national sales force. 
"The announcement puts an end over 10 months of uncertainty about whether the deal would be signed off and 
sees Imperial Tobacco trade back up near all-time highs on the basis that it is set to become the new number-three 
US player in the USD100 billion US market, with a 10% market share behind that of leader Altria Group (47%) and 
the new Reynolds-Lorillard combo (34%)," says Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. 
Weir Group trades down 1.2% after being downgraded to Hold from Buy by Deutsche Bank, which says a recovery 
in US rig count will not see an immediate surge in pressure pumping demand due to incomplete wells. 
Meanwhile, Lloyds of London isurers Beazley, up 5.6% and Hiscox, up 3.0%, are amongst the best FTSE 250 
performers after both being upgraded to Overweight from Neutral by JP Morgan. 
De La Rue shares trade down 9.0% after it reported a drop in pretax profit in its recently completed financial year, 
as margins were squeezed by pricing pressure and the company achieved lower levels of new business than 
expected in its identity systems and security products. Weakness in the euro has put further pressure on its 
profitability in the new financial year, the company said.
Brewin Dolphin is down 4.6%. The wealth manager's chief executive said the company is entering the final stages 
of the transformation programme launched in 2012, as the company reported higher first-half pretax profit and 
discretionary funds under management.
In a statement, Brewin Dolphin said its discretionary funds under management amounted to GBP26.2 billion at the 
end of March, up from GBP24.0 billion at the end of its last financial year and from GBP22.7 billion at the end of the 
first half of that year. However, some analysts continue to remain cautious on the group until after the 
transformation is complete.
In the AIM All-Share index, RapidCloud International shares are up 15% as it said its Emerge Systems subsidiary 
has won two contracts for the PortalWEB product worth a total of GBP180,000 in the first year. The first of the 
contracts is with a leading printing company, while the second is with a major Southeast Asian airline. Neither 
company was named by RapidCloud.
Still ahead in the economic calendar are weekly US MBA mortgage applications at 1200 BST and the Redbook 
index at 1355 BST. 
US futures point to a flat-to-higher open with all the DJIA, and Nasdaq 100 both a touch higher, and the S&P 500 
flat.

De La Rue, down 8.9%. The banknote printer reported a drop in pretax profit in its recently completed financial

profitability in the new financial year, the company said.
Brewin Dolphin Holdings, down 7.2%. Shares in the wealth manager are down even though it reported higher first-
half pretax profit and discretionary funds under management. However, some analysts said they will be cautious as 
the company enters the final stages of its transformation programme launched in 2012, with Panmure Gordon 
retaining a Sell stance, and Numis downgrading the company to Hold from Add. 
AG Barr, down 2.7%. The soft drinks company said its sales declined in the first 15 weeks of its financial year, in 
line with its expectations, as sales stabilise following a strong first half performance a year earlier. AG Barr said total 
group sales in the fifteen weeks from January 26 to May 9 were down by 1.1% year-on-year. It said the sales 
decline reflects a return to a more normal sales performance following a strong first half a year earlier, related to 
marketing and promotional activity around the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.
PZ Cussons, down 2.3%. Panmure Gordon downgraded the consumer products group to Sell from Hold.
SSP Group, down 1.8%. Swedish private equity fund EQT IV confirmed it has sold just under 95 million shares in

290 pence per share means EQT no longer holds any stake in SSP.

Construction No 2 Co, a potential partner for the project, will carry out a site visit in July to further evaluate 
partnership opportunities. Edenville also reported a pretax loss of GBP2.3 million in 2014, slightly narrower from the 
GBP2.4 million loss in 2013.

million in 2014 which is widened from the EUR7.8 million loss in 2013. Lansdowne Oil & Gas shares are down 16% 
as it has a 20% interest in the project. 
Trinity Exploration and Production, down 12%. The oil & gas company said it swung to a substantial pretax loss in 
2014 after making significant impairments against its assets due to the fall in oil prices as it continues its strategic 
review which may lead to the sale of the company. Trinity reported a USD128.8 million pretax loss in 2014, 
swinging from a pretax profit of USD48.0 million a year earlier, as revenue dipped to USD113.5 million from 
USD123.8 million.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Shares in FTSE 100 constituents CRH, Imperial Tobacco and British Airways owner 
IAG all are benefiting Wednesday from progress in their respective acquisition plans.
But what everyone is talking about in the City is what is happening in Switzerland.
Swiss prosecutors are investigating possible corruption related to the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 football World 
Championships to Russia and Qatar, officials report.
They seized files at the headquarters of football's ruling body FIFA in Zurich and plan to question 10 members of 
the FIFA Executive Committee who were involved in the decision in 2010, the Federal Prosecution Authority says, 
calling the officials "witnesses".
The Swiss investigation is separate from a US probe into alleged bribes paid to FIFA associates related to US and 
Latin American tournaments, resulting in six arrests in Zurich earlier on Wednesday.
Police arrested the six football officials for extradition to the US where they are to face corruption charges. The 
Swiss Federal Office of Justice said the Zurich arrests were on suspicion of accepting bribes.
The six can agree to be extradited to the US "immediately". If they don't agree, the US will need to submit a formal 
extradition request, a statement said.
The arrests at dawn were carried out as officials from football's world governing body FIFA were gathered at the 
Baur au Lac hotel ahead of their annual congress opening Thursday.

Iraqi security forces have rebel-held Ramadi hemmed in on three sides in an offensive to recapture the capital of 
western Anbar province, nine days after the city fell to Islamic State jihadists. "The legions of our armed 
forces...with the support of the Popular Mobilization and the tribesmen are now beginning the operation to free 
Anbar from the Islamic State gangs," Defence Minister Khalid al-Obeidi wrote on his Facebook page. The Iraqi 
Army and police were taking part in operations alongside mainly Shiite volunteers from across the country and local 
tribes from the Sunni province, Captain Ahmad Ibrahim of the Anbar police command told dpa.

A Saudi-led coalition targeted the headquarters of Yemen's special forces in the capital, Sana'a, killing at least 30 
people, medical officials said. A Health Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most of the dead 
were special forces troops, and at least 100 people had also been injured. The special forces, which include 
counterterrorism forces trained to take on the Yemeni branch of al-Qaeda, are loyal to former president Ali Abdullah 
Saleh. Along with other pro-Saleh forces, they have supported the mainly Shiite Houthi rebels in their advance 
across the country.

UN-sponsored peace talks on Yemen planned for Thursday have been postponed at the request of the Yemeni

Geneva aim to bring together key stakeholders in the Yemen conflict to reinvigorate the political peace process that 
stalled when Houthi rebels overran parts of the country. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is working to convene 
the talks "at the earliest possible time."

Iraqi security forces have rebel-held Ramadi hemmed in on three sides in an offensive to recapture the capital of 
western Anbar province, nine days after the city fell to Islamic State jihadists. "The legions of our armed 
forces...with the support of the Popular Mobilization and the tribesmen are now beginning the operation to free 
Anbar from the Islamic State gangs," Defence Minister Khalid al-Obeidi wrote on his Facebook page. The Iraqi 
Army and police were taking part in operations alongside mainly Shiite volunteers from across the country and local

A Saudi-led coalition targeted the headquarters of Yemen's special forces in the capital, Sana'a, killing at least 30 
people, medical officials said. A Health Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most of the dead

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Wednesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group late Tuesday said it has moved a step closer to being taken over by British 
Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group in a EUR1.4 billion deal, after the Irish government gave 
its backing to the deal. The offer remains conditional on securing the approval of both the Irish government and 
budget carrier Ryanair Holdings, both of which hold substantial stakes in Aer Lingus, along with it securing 
regulatory approval in Europe and the UK. The Irish government, however, said it supports the takeover bid from 
IAG after it was confirmed that Aer Lingus would keep its existing slots at Heathrow airport. The Irish Parliament, 
the Dáil, still has to vote on the approval.
----------
Imperial Tobacco Group shares are among the top FTSE 100 gainers after the US Federal Trade Commission 
approved the acquisition of Lorillard by Reynolds American. As part of that US merger, Imperial Tobacco previously 
had agreed to acquire from the pair a portfolio of US cigarette brands, e-cigarette brand blu, and Lorillard's cigarette 
factory and national sales force.
---------
Rolls-Royce Holdings said it has secured a contract from US aerospace and defence company General Dynamics' 
European Land Systems unit for 589 MTU Seris 199 diesel engines. The order is worth around EUR80 million and 
the engines are to be used in the SCOUT Specialist Vehicle General Dynamics has built for the British Army. It will 
be the first time MTU engines have been used by the British Army.
----------
Royal Bank of Scotland Group late Tuesday said it has agreed to sell a loan portfolio to Cerberus Capital 
Management at a loss, with the sale being the last "material" transaction for the part of the group running down bad 
TOP NEWS: IAG Close To Clinching Aer Lingus After Irish Backing
or unwanted assets in Northern Ireland. In a statement, RBS said it will receive GBP205 million at current exchange 
rates for the sale, with the deal expected to complete in June, as RBS Capital Resolution continues to sell billions of 
pounds in assets with high capital intensity or risks. RBS said the sale of the loan portfolios was in addition to the 
disposal of a portfolio of Irish real estate loans to Cerberus in December.
----------
CRH late Tuesday said Lafarge and Holcim have accepted its offer to buy assets from them for EUR6.5 billion 
including debt and are now legally bound to the terms of the acquisition. "The acquisition remains conditional upon 
successful completion of the merger of Lafarge and Holcim as well as the completion of local asset reorganisations. 
The acquisition is expected to complete in the second half of 2015," CRH said in a statement.
----------
Brewin Dolphin's chief executive said the wealth manager is entering the final stages of the transformation 
programme launched in 2012, as the company reported higher first-half pretax profit and discretionary funds under 
management. In a statement, Brewin Dolphin said its discretionary funds under management amounted to GBP26.2 
billion at the end of March, up from GBP24.0 billion at the end of its last financial year and from GBP22.7 billion at 
the end of the first half of that year. The wealth manager's GBP37.9 million pretax profit in the first half ended March 
31 was higher than the GBP22.0 million recorded in the corresponding period of the prior year.
----------
De La Rue reported a drop in pretax profit in its recently completed financial year, as margins were squeezed by 
pricing pressure and the company achieved lowers levels of new business than expected in its identity systems and 
security products. Weakness in the euro has put further pressure on its profitability in the new financial year, the 
company said. The banknote printer and security paper maker said it made a GBP38.9 million pretax profit in the 
year ended March 28, compared with GBP59.8 million in the prior year. Revenue was down to GBP472.1 million 
from GBP513.3 million. De La Rue cut its dividend for the year to 25.0 pence per share from 42.3p, saying it will 
aim to maintain dividends at the 2014/15 level as it is "mindful" of how important the dividend is to shareholders.
----------
AG Barr said its sales declined in the first 15 weeks of its financial year, in line with its expectations, as sales 
stabilise following a strong first half performance a year earlier. The soft drinks company said it remains on track to 
meet market forecasts for the year. FTSE 250-listed AG Barr said total group sales in the fifteen weeks from 
January 26 to May 9 were down by 1.1% year-on-year. It said the sales decline reflects a return to a more normal 
sales performance following a strong first half a year earlier, related to marketing and promotional activity around 
the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.
----------
Greeting cards and gifts retailer Card Factory affirmed its expectations for the full year to the end of January 2016 
as it said like-for-like sales growth in the first quarter of its financial year was in line with targets. FTSE 250-listed 
Card Factory said revenue in the first three months of its financial year to the end of April rose by 7.5%, slightly 
weaker than the 8.5% growth in the first quarter of its 2015 financial year, but flat on the growth seen in the second 
half of that financial year.
----------
Swedish private equity fund EQT IV confirmed it has sold just under 95 million shares in airport and train station 
concessions operator SSP Group, a 20% stake, to raise GBP275 million. The sale of the shares at 290 pence per 
share means EQT no longer holds any stake in SSP.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC shares surged higher Tuesday morning after the Irish budget 
carrier said its net profit for the financial year to the end of March beat its upgraded guidance on the back of 
stronger revenue and higher customer numbers and as its load factor inproved.
Ryanair shares were up 5.5% to EUR11.52 pence on Tuesday.
The airline said its profit after tax for the year to March 31 was EUR867 million, up 66% from the EUR523 million 
reported a year earlier and ahead of the upgraded guidance it issued in February for net profit of EUR840 million to 
EUR850 million. That guidance upgrade was the third the group had made since its half-year results were published 
in November, as it was boosted by falling fuel prices which eventually resulted in its net margin improving to 15% 
from 10% a year earlier.
Ryanair said its customer numbers rose to 90.6 million in the year, up 11% from 81.7 million in its 2014 financial 
year, while its load factor improved to 88% from 83%. Those factors helped revenue to rise to EUR5.65 billion from 
EUR5.04 billion and were complemented by strong ancillary revenue, which increased slightly ahead of traffic 
growth.
The group said it would not pay any further dividend for the financial year, but already paid a EUR520 million 
special dividend in February and, the same month, launched a EUR400 million share buyback, which is set to last 
until August.
Forward bookings for the company are ahead around 4% year-on-year for the summer 2015 period, which Ryanair 
expects to result in its load factor improving by a further 2 percentage points to 90% for 2016.
Ryanair said its summer 2015 fleet of 320 aircraft will be insufficient to handle demand, meaning it will lease-in six 
aircraft in the peak period, down from seven a year earlier, in order to meet demand. It expects more than half the 
growth to occur in primary airports such as Brussels, Lisbon, Rome, Athens, Copenhagen, Berlin, Cologne, Dublin 
UPDATE: Ryanair Soars As Net Profit Beats Guidance On Better Margins
and London Stansted. The growth has been driven by the introduction of its Business Plus and Family Extra 
services, it said.
Punctuality for the airline was slightly weaker in the year, down to 90% from 92%, due to strike actions and airspace 
closures and owing to adverse weather conditions in some European regions over the winter.
Ryanair took particular aim in its full-year statement at what is considers "over-regulation" in the European airline 
industry, claiming this "frequently places producer monopoly protection above the interest of consumers, or growth 
in tourism and jobs." The airline's ire is specifically targeted at the European Emission Trading System and the 
European Single Sky airspace regulation project, which it describes as a "shambles", as well as a failure to prohibit 
air traffic control strikes.
Ryanair also reiterated its continuing push to get the UK's Competition and Markets Authority to reverse its ruling 
forcing Ryanair to sell down its stake in Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC to 5% from 29.8%. In April, the CMA 
said there had been no material change in circumstances or any special reason to reverse the ruling.
Ryanair initially made the request for the ruling to be reversed in February, arguing that the bid made for Aer Lingus 
by International Consolidated Airlines Group, the FTSE 100-listed owner of British Airways, and the period of time 
since the decision was initially made in August 2013,  constituted a material change in circumstances and that the 
competition regulator no longer had the power to impose a divestment remedy on Ryanair.
On Tuesday, Ryanair said it was "amazed" by the CMA's decision not to reverse the ruling and claimed that should 
it fail to do so in the future, the CMA would be "totally discredited".
On the Aer Lingus deal, Ryanair said its approach to the bid from IAG remains unchanged, saying it would consider 
any offer from IAG on its merits. Aer Lingus itself, in its first quarter results, said it remains strongly in favour of the 
IAG's EUR1.36 billion takeover bid, but the offer still needs to gain acceptance from both Ryanair and the Irish 
government.
Elsewhere, Ryanair expressed its support for additional capacity in the London airport market, arguing the market 
should be free to build three new runways, one each for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, as this represents the 
only long-term solution to the capacity problems in the south east.
For the year ahead, Ryanair said that while it expects traffic growth of around 10%, it thinks it would be "foolish" not 
to expect "some irrational pricing response" from its competitors. As a result, it expects that even with the benefit of 
lower fuel prices, aircraft and financing costs it may suffer period of fare and yield weakness in the coming financial 
year, particularly in the winter. As a result, its yield guidance for the year is cautious, but despite that, it still expects 
net profit to rise to between EUR940 million and EUR970 million in the coming year.
Liberum said the results from Ryanair were in line with consensus and slightly ahead of the broker's own forecasts, 
but said it would review its Buy recommendation as the valuation on the company is starting to look full.
Analyst Gerald Khoo said Ryanair continues to trade on a deserved premium to the other European airlines, 
reflecting its strong earnings momentum and superior return on invested capital and margins.
"However, the rating does appear a little full in absolute terms and further share price upside is likely to be reliant 
upon estimates being revised higher. We shall review our Buy recommendation and EUR10.50 target price as 
necessary," the analyst added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum says Ryanair's full-year results were in-line with consensus and marginally 
ahead of its own forecasts, but it will review its Buy recommendation for the low-cost airline as it reaches a full 
valuation. 
Compared with broker's estimates, revenue came in better than forecast, but costs were slightly worse than 
expected, with fuel and staff costs particularly disappointing, Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo says. 
"We suspect exchange rates may have had a distorting effect, and this would follow the pattern established by the 
other European airlines in this reporting season," Khoo adds. 
However, the Liberum analyst is particularly encouraged by management's guidance of a 10% improvement in 
profits in financial year 2016, which should, subject to second-half yields over which the firm has no visibility, rise to 
a range of between EUR940 million and EUR970 million for the full year to March 2016. This is ahead of Liberum's 
EUR906 million forecast. 
"We have been cautious on the yield outlook, but it appears there is room for some optimism. We would expect the 
market to assume that management is being cautious in its guidance, with consensus estimates likely to aim ahead 
of this range," Khoo says
Khoo says Ryanair continues to trade on a deserved premium to the other European airlines, reflecting its strong 
earnings momentum and superior return on invested capital and margins.
"However, the rating does appear a little full in absolute terms and further share price upside is likely to be reliant 
upon estimates being revised higher. We shall review our Buy recommendation and EUR10.50 target price as 
necessary," the analyst says. 
Ryanair's results similarly beat Panmure Gordon's estimates, and the broker reiterates its Buy rating and EUR13.00 
price target.

"The strong earnings momentum, whether in a high or low fuel price environment, combined with a defendable cost 
advantage, long term growth prospects, attractive returns and strong cash generation, in our view justifies an 
enhanced valuation," says Panmure analyst Gert Zonneveld.
Ryanair trades up 3.2% at EUR11.27 Tuesday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Airline stocks were grabbing attention in London, after Irish discount carrier Ryanair 
Holdings reported surging profit and the Financial Times said the Irish government may approve the EUR1.3 billion 
sale of Aer Lingus Group to British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines Group as early as Tuesday.
At midday, Ryanair shares were up 6.5%, while shares fellow budget airline easyJet were up 0.7%. IAG shares 
were up 0.8% and Aer Lingus shares up 2.2%. The airline stocks also were benefiting Tuesday from a decline in 
world oil prices Tuesday.
Ryanair Holdings said its net profit for the financial year to the end of March beat its upgraded guidance on the back 
of stronger revenue and higher customer numbers and as its load factor improved. 
The airline said its profit after tax for the year to March 31 was EUR867 million, up 66% from the EUR523 million 
reported a year earlier and ahead of the upgraded guidance it issued in February for net profit of EUR840 million to 
EUR850 million. That guidance upgrade was the third the group had made since its half-year results were published

to gain acceptance from both Ryanair and the Irish government.
The Irish cabinet is set to study the recommendation at its weekly meeting on Tuesday, according to Prime Minister 
Enda Kenny, the FT said. Sources close to the matter cited by the newspaper said the government believes it has 
won significant concessions from IAG on the future of Aer Lingus' take-off and landing slots at Heathrow, a key 
stumbling block standing in the way of the deal.
The advisers are understood to have told the Irish government that IAG's takeover bid is fair, the FT reported, 
though even if the government approves the deal Tuesday, it will still face a parliamentary vote, amid fierce 
opposition to the deal from opposition political parties.

A Greek government spokesman played down suggestions by two leading cabinet ministers that the country is 
about to default on its debt, saying all efforts were being taken to repay a looming IMF loan on schedule. Gabriel 
Sakellaridis said Greece would maintain repayments to its EU-IMF creditors for as long as possible. He also 
rejected the idea of possible capital controls that would restrict money transfers and access to savings. On Sunday, 
the country's interior minister had said Greece does not have the money to make a repayment to the IMF by June, 
and New Democracy MP Dora Bakogiannis had said on national television that the government may be forced to 
impose capital controls in banks if it fails to reach a deal with international creditors before the upcoming three-day 
long Pentecost weekend.

British Prime Minister David Cameron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday 
began renegotiating the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of an in-out referendum. Cameron hosted a 
dinner for Juncker at Chequers, the prime minister's official residence in southern England, officials said. Cameron 
is to travel to several European capitals this week, including Paris and Berlin, to push his case for reform. He is 
expected to give more details to his plans for the referendum in a speech to the state opening of parliament on 
Wednesday.
----------
Meanwhile, Cameron told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday that the two nations must cooperate to 
implement the Minsk ceasefire agreement on Ukraine despite "deep differences" between them. Cameron told 
Putin by telephone that "they would continue to have deep differences but that the priority now must be to deliver 
full implementation of the Minsk agreement," his spokesman said.
----------
British retailers posted strong growth in sales this month and their outlook for sales and orders improved at an even 
stronger pace in the year to June, the quarterly Distributive Trades Survey from the Confederation of British 
Industry showed. A balance of 51% said sales increased in May, up from the prior month's balance of 12% and 
expectations of 40%. Sales were well above average for the time of year, to the greatest extent since April 2007, 
the survey showed. Retailers expect sales volumes to grow again next month, as the balance rose to 58% for June. 
The business lobby said expectations for next month are at their highest level for 27 years.
----------
The Chinese government has decided to cut import tariffs on consumer goods such as cosmetics, shoes, clothes 
and diapers in June, in a bid to boost domestic consumption amid slowing economic growth. Import taxes on some 
products will be lowered by an average over 50%, starting June 1, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on 
Monday. Tariffs on imported clothes will be slashed 7-10% from 14-23%. The levy on imported cosmetics will be 
reduced to 2% from 5% and the tax on imported shoes and boots is set to be halved to 12%. Import tariffs on 
diapers will be cut to 2% from 7.5%.
----------
Japan posted a merchandise trade deficit of JPY53.44 billion in April, the Ministry of Finance said on Monday. The 
headline figure beat expectations for a deficit of JPY386.8 billion following the upwardly revised JPY50 billion 
surplus in March (originally JPY3.3 billion). Exports climbed 8.0% on year - also topping forecasts for an increase of 
6.0% following the 8.5% jump in the previous month.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi hit back at criticisms of his country's security forces over the fall of the western 
city of Ramadi to Islamic State jihadists. A day after US Defence Secretary Ash Carter said Iraqi forces had 
"showed no will to fight" over the capital of al-Anbar province, al-Abadi said that the city would be recaptured "within 
days." The jihadists had only captured "a small area inside Ramadi," while government forces had gained ground 
outside the city, the prime minister told the BBC.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets are set to open on a mixed note on Tuesday, with nagging Greek 
worries and heightened political uncertainty in Spain following local elections likely to keep investor sentiment 
subdued.
Greece's government on Monday ruled out imposing controls over capital flows after an opposition lawmaker 
suggested the move if the country fails to strike a deal with its creditors soon. Gabriel Sakellaridis, the spokesman 
for the Greek government, reportedly said that the speculation of imposing capital controls was "unfounded and 
malicious".
Meanwhile, Klaus Regling, the head of the European Stability Mechanism, told Germany's Bild newspaper on 
Tuesday that without an agreement on reforms with creditors, Greece will not get any new loans.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party suffered its worst result in 20 years in a municipal election, 
as the voters punished his government for four years of austerity and a raft of corruption scandals before a general 
election due in November.
The dollar hit a one-month high against a basket of major currencies even as Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said 
on Monday that it was "misleading" to give so much importance to the Fed's first interest rate hike since 2006.
After Friday's relatively positive inflation data and comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen, investors eye reports on 
durable goods orders, new home sales and consumer confidence later in the day for further clues to the Fed policy 
outlook.
Asian stocks are mostly higher on the back of strong gains in Hong Kong and China after Beijing announced a 
USD300bn infrastructure spending package over the weekend and unveiled fresh plans to expedite cross-border 
investment.
European Stocks To See Cautious Start
In domestic corporate news, Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG announced that the US Food and Drug 
Administration has provided 510(k) clearance for the cobas Cdiff Test to detect Clostridium difficile in stool 
specimens.
Media reports suggest that UBS Group AG is shutting its Australian wealth management unit, with senior 
employees offering to serve clients through a new company.
Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said its full-year profit after tax climbed 66% to 867 million euros from 523 
million euros last year.
The European markets closed mostly lower in thin holiday trading on Monday, mirroring losses on Wall Street 
Friday after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janel Yellen hinted that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates at 
some point this year, as long as economic activity picks up.
The Greek and Spanish stock markets were hit hard due to concerns over Greece and the poor election result for 
the governing Popular Party in regional and municipal elections. The German and UK markets were closed for 
holidays. US equity markets were also closed for the Memorial Day holiday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Share prices in London are pointed to a slightly higher open Tuesday as investors and 
in the US and UK and in parts of Europe return from a long weekend to catch up with the equity market gains made

IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 to open 15.1 points higher at 7,046.8. The index closed up 0.3% at 7,031.72 
on Friday.
Wall Street closed lower on Friday, with the DJIA ending down 0.3%, the S&P 500 closing down 0.2% and the 
Nasdaq Composite ending just a touch lower.
In Paris on Monday, the CAC 40 closed down 0.5%, while the market in Frankfurt was closed. 
In Asia Tuesday, the Japanese Nikkei closed up 0.1% pushing on to new 15-year highs. The Hang Seng trades up 
1.3%, and the Shanghai Composite is up 1.6%, rising to seven-year highs. On Monday, the Japanese Nikkei closed 
up 0.7% and the Shanghai Composite ended up 3.4%. Hong Kong was closed.
The Chinese government decided to cut import tariffs on consumer goods such as cosmetics, shoes, and clothes in 
June, in a bid to boost domestic consumption amid slowing economic growth. Import taxes on some products will 
be lowered by an average over 50%, starting June 1, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on Monday.

LONDON MARKET COMMENT: Stocks To Take Lead From Positive Asia Sessions
On Sunday, the country's interior minister had said Greece does not have the money to make a repayment to the 
IMF by June.
Greece is believed to be close to going bankrupt after failing for months to access EUR7.2 billion left in its 
international bailout, causing the euro to trade at its lowest level in almost a month against the dollar at USD1.0906.
Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings said early Tuesday its full-year profit after tax climbed 66% to EUR867 million 
from EUR523 million in the prior year. Net margin jumped from 10% to 15%.
AstraZeneca said Amgen Inc has terminated their co-development and commercialisation deal for monoclonal 
antibody brodalumab after observing "suicidal ideation and behaviour events" in the programme that might result in 
"restrictive labelling".
Elsewhere in the UK corporate calendar, cinema chain Cineworld Group and software developer Micro Focus 
International both issued trading statements. Industrial chains and power transmission products supplier Renold 
reported full-year results, as did Minds + Machines Group.
In the economic calendar, the Confederation of British Industry's Distributive Trades Survey is at 1100 BST, and US

PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets were trading lower on Tuesday, as concerns about Greece 
remained with the country expected to make a 300 million euros payment to the International Monetary Fund next 
week.
Sentiment was also impacted by political uncertainty in Spain, where Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party 
suffered its worst result in 20 years in a municipal election, as the voters punished his government for four years of 
austerity and a raft of corruption scandals before a general election due in November.
On a day of very little economic news, the quarterly Distributive Trades Survey from the Confederation of British 
Industry showed British retailers posted strong growth in sales this month and their outlook for sales and orders 
improved at an even stronger pace in the year to June.
A balance of 51% said sales increased in May, up from the prior month's balance of 12% and expectations of 40%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks was losing 0.43%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, was falling 0.29%.
The German DAX, the FTSE 100 index of the UK and Switzerland's SMI were moderately lower, while the French 
CAC 40 slipped 0.1%.
In Frankfurt, steel giant ThyssenKrupp declined 1.8%. Utilities RWE and E.ON declined 1.7% and 1.5%, 
respectively.
Commerzbank was falling 1.4%, while Deutsche Bank dropped 1.1%.
In Paris, Societe Generale declined 2.3%. Peer BNP Paribas was modestly lower, while Credit Agricole managed to 
trade in positive territory.
Tire maker Michelin and utility EDF dropped 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively.
European Markets Fall Amid Greece Concerns
Meanwhile, telecom firm Orange gained 1.5% and media giant Vivendi was adding 2%.
In London, Intertek fell 1.8% and Centrica dropped 1.6%.
Hikma Pharma was losing 1.4% while WM Morrison dropped 1.3%.
Weir Group added close to 3% and Royal Mail gained 2.8%.
Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments climbed nearly 2% each.
Ryanair jumped more than 6% after reporting a strong growth in full-year profit.
The Asian stocks reversed early losses to end mostly higher as Chinese shares continued to rally and a rebound in 
iron ore prices lifted resource stocks.
In the US, futures point to a cautious open on Wall Street, following a public holiday on Monday.
Crude for July delivery fell USD0.43 to USD59.29 per barrel, while June gold dropped USD9.8 to USD1194.2 a troy 
ounce.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are amongst the biggest risers and fallers within the main London 
indices midday Tuesday.
-------
FTSE 100 WINNERS
-------
Royal Mail, up 3%. Cantor Fitzgerald has upgraded the UK's legacy postal operator to Hold from Sell, saying that 
the company's valuation now fits in with its forecasts. The broker also has lifted its price target to 500.00 pence from 
440.00p, noting that it now expects capital expenditure and cash restructuring charges will be, in aggregate, GBP70 
million lower each year, and inflows from property and other disposals will be GBP30 million higher.
Taylor Wimpey, up 1.5%, Barratt Developments, up 1.3%, and Persimmon, up 0.6%. The housebuilding companies 
are among the biggest risers in the blue-chip index after Deutsche Bank increased their respective price targets. 
Deutsche Bank lifted Taylor Wimpey's price target to 210 pence from 173p, Barratt Developments' to 659p from 
576p, and Persimmon's to 2,068p from 1,648p. The investment bank has a Buy recommendation for both Taylor 
Wimpey and Barratt Developments, while it has a Hold rating for Persimmon.
EasyJet, up 0.5%, and International Consolidated Airlines, up 0.2%. Shares in airline companies have edged higher 
after Ryanair Holdings said that its profit after tax in the financial year to the end of March climbed 66% to EUR867 
million from EUR523 million, while its margin also increased. The airlines also are benefiting from lower oil prices 
Tuesday. Brent oil fell below the key USD65 a barrel level, but has since rebounded slightly and trades at 
USD65.03, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate, sunk under the USD60 a barrel level, now trading at 
USD59.33 a barrel. Ryanair shares are up 7.0% to EUR11.68.
-------
FTSE 100 LOSERS
-------
WINNERS & LOSERS : Inditherm Shares Soar On Reverse Takeover Proposal
Randgold Resources, down 1.6% at 4,702.00 pence. Shares in the gold producer are down after Goldman Sachs 
lowered its price target on the company to 4,450p from 4,500p, maintaining its Neutral recommendation.
GlaxoSmithKline, down 1.1% at 1,448.00p. JPMorgan has slashed its price target for the pharmaceutical giant to 
1,320 pence from 1,380p, retaining its Underweight recommendation on the stock. 
Royal Dutch Shell 'A' and 'B' shares, down 1.4%. The Financial Times has reported that the oil reserves that Shell 
are hoping to find in the Artic are unlikely to be brought into production before the 2030s due to the difficulty 
involved in securing environmental approvals. Marvin Odum, head of oil and gas production for Shell in the 
Americas, told the FT the company's success or failure this year and in 2016 in making a significant discovery will 
be critical for the future of oil development in the Arctic region. The oil and gas major is also likely being affected by 
the lower price of oil.
AstraZeneca, down 1.2%. The pharmaceutical company said that Amgen Inc has terminated their co-development 
and commercialisation deal for monoclonal antibody brodalumab after observing "suicidal ideation and behaviour 
events" in the programme that might result in "restrictive labelling". Brodalumab was developed by Amgen and was 
in development for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis. The two 
companies entered into a collaboration deal in April 2012 for five monoclonal antibodies from Amgen's clinical 
inflammation portfolio, including brodalumab.
-------
FTSE 250 WINNERS
-------
Cineworld Group, up 2.4%. The cinema operator's shares have risen after it reported a rise in revenue in the first 19 
weeks of 2015 as sales grew in each of its divisions, and said it is confident it will meet market expectations for the 
full year. It said total sales in the 19 weeks to May 14 grew 26.8% on the year before, with the box office growing 
23.8%, retail rising 27.9% and other income up 47.1%.
Berkeley Group Holdings, up 1.7%, Bellway, up 1.2%, and Crest Nicholson Holdings, up 1%. Like their FTSE 100 
counterparts, the FTSE 250 house builders are up on the back of upward price target revisions by Deutsche Bank. 
The investment bank has increased its price target on Berkeley Group to 3,471 pence from 2,749p, on Bellway to 
2,316p from 2,104p, and on Crest Nicholson to 486p from 402p. Deutsche Bank has a Hold recommendation on all 
three stocks.
WS Atkins, up 1.2%. Panmure Gordon has increased its price target on WS Atkins to 1,575 pence from 1,500p, 
maintaining a Buy recommendation on the stock and saying that its confidence in the engineering and design 
consultancy company is growing ahead of its financial year 2015 results. "Leading indicators have sent mixed 
signals recently, though industry data suggests its end markets continue to improve, supporting our view that higher 
earnings quality and attractive returns should expand the valuation rating for Atkins," says Kevin Fogarty, an analyst 
at Panmure.
Micro Focus International, up 1.1%. The software company has reiterated its full-year guidance on a pro-forma 
basis including its acquisition of The Attachmate Group Inc, saying the result "reflects a strong finish" to its recently 
ended financial year. Micro Focus expects to post adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation, excluding some other exceptional costs and foreign currency gains of at least USD345 million for the 
year to end-April, on revenues of around USD835 million. This will include a contribution from Attachmate from the 
period from November 20 2014 to end-April 2015.
-------
FTSE 250 LOSERS
-------
Tullow Oil, down 4.6%, Premier Oil, down 2.3%, and Petrofac, down 1.5%. The oil related companies' shares have 
fallen as the price of oil continues to trade lower. 
-------
WINNERS & LOSERS : Inditherm Shares Soar On Reverse Takeover Proposal
AIM ALL-SHARE WINNERS
-------
Inditherm, up 63%. The heating products company has proposed a reverse takeover of medical device distribution 
firm Inspiration Healthcare Ltd, a share consolidation, and changing its name to Inspiration Healthcare Group. The 
proposals include a share consolidation of every ten existing ordinary shares into one new share, following which 
the vendors of Inspiration Healthcare will receive 25.56 million new shares or 83.3% of the company's enlarged 
share capital as consideration for the reverse takeover, which values Inspiration at GBP7.2 million. 
Premier African Minerals, up 22%. The company's shares have jumped after it said it remains on track with the 
RHA Tungsten project in Zimbabwe. It said the process plant was delivered to the site on schedule and said the 
offloading plant and management team induction has now been completed.
Coms, up 22%. The company has agreed to sell the business and some assets of its telecoms operations to Timico 
for an initial GBP2.5 million, with a further GBP1 million payable depending on the trading performance of the 
business. Following the completion of the sale, Coms will be comprised of its remaining infrastructure business 
Redstone and London video production company Darkside Studios. 
Eden Research, up 21%. Shares in the company are up after it announced that its first product 3AEY has been 
authorised for the treatment of botrytis in table and wine grapes from the Regulatory Affairs Directorate in Malta. 
Malta is acting as the zonal rapporteur member state for the Southern EU agricultural zone. Following this 
authorisation Eden expects the remaining member states across the Southern Zone to grant authorisation for the 
sale and use of 3AEY in their jurisdictions within the allocated 120 days.
Plus500, up 19%. The contracts-for-difference trading platform provider's shares have rebounded somewhat after 
closing down 35% on Friday. Shares in Plus500 fell sharply Friday after it resumed trading as it goes through anti-
money laundering procedures that have resulted in the freezing of client accounts in the UK. 
ScotGold Resources, up 17%. The company's share price has surged after it said the total ore reserve estimate for 
the Cononish gold project in Scotland has nearly doubled. It said the total ore reserve estimate, provided by Bara 
Consulting Ltd, has been increased to 198,000 ounces of gold, nearly triple the previous estimate, and 851,000 
ounces of silver. The life of mine has been increased to approximately eight years, the company said, at a 
processing rate of 72,000 tonnes per year. The average annual gold equivalent production for Cononish has been 
increased to around 23,000 ounces per year.

AIM ALL-SHARE LOSERS
-------
William Sinclair Holdings, off 18%. The horticultural products company has warned that it will face a funding 
shortfall over the summer and is considering options on how to raise cash, as it said it has appointed an interim 
chief executive officer. It said that following a review of the business and a move to address unprofitable contracts, 
it has undertaken a detailed budgeting review which has revealed it will face a funding shortfall in the summer. The 
company did not provide any details on the size of the shortfall. As a result, the company is considering a number of 
strategic options, including raising capital, selling assets and more aggressive operational changes in order to 
resolve the issue. In a separate statement, William Sinclair said it has hired Stuart Burgin as its interim chief 
executive.
Minds + Machines Group, down 11%. Shares in the company have fallen despite it reporting a rise in pretax profit 
for 2014 as a result of gains from participating in auctions for new generic top level domains during the year. For 
2014 the company posted a pretax profit of USD22.1 million, up from USD1.1 million in 2013, as revenue rose to 
USD1.9 million from USD56,000 and as a USD33.7 million gain from generic top level domain auctions offset a step 
up in administrative costs. The company also announced the departure of Executive Chairman Fred Kreuger. Keith 
Teare has been appointed as non-executive chairman. 
WINNERS & LOSERS : Inditherm Shares Soar On Reverse Takeover Proposal
Publishing Technology, down 11%. The publishing software and services company has proposed a discounted 
share placing to raise up to GBP9 million and an open offer to raise a further GBP1 million, which it plans to use to 
pay down its debts, as it posted a swing to a pretax loss for 2014. It posted a pretax loss of GBP4.0 million for 2014, 
compared to a pretax profit of GBP665,000 in 2013, as revenue fell to GBP14.4 million from GBP16.9 million, gross 
margin was reduced and it invested in restructuring the business throughout the year. The company plans to raise 
GBP9 million in the placing of 7.5 million shares, and a potential further GBP1 million through an open offer for 
833,333 shares, both at a price of 120 pence, a 19% discount from its closing price of 148 pence last Friday. 
Publishing Technology's shares are quoted at 132.00 pence.

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said its full-year profit after tax 
climbed 66% to EUR867 million from EUR523 million in the prior year. Net margin jumped from 10% to 15%.
Earnings per basic share rose to 62.59 euro cents from 36.96 euro cents in the previous year. Revenue grew 12% 
to EUR5.65 billion from EUR5.04 billion reported last year. Ryanair said traffic was up 11% as load factors rose 
from 83% to 88%.
The company continues to experience strong demand and forward booking momentum. Average load factors in the 
first four months of 2015 grew 10%.
While this will slow to 1 or 2% over the peak summer months forward bookings are on average 4% ahead of this 
time last year, as the airline's earlier schedules, lower prices and AGB customer program, particularly at primary 
airports attracts new customers to Ryanair.
Looking ahead, the company believes that lower unit costs in fiscal 2016 will still provide a 10% improvement in 
profits, which should, subject to second-half yields over which the firm has no visibility, rise to a range of EUR940 
million to EUR970 million for the full year to March 2016.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Barclays says multiple theories can be tabled about why underlying trading for budget 
carrier easyJet has taken a hit, but it thinks the fundamental investment case for the business remains robust.
Barclays cuts its 2015 earnings per share estimate for easyJet by 7% and its pretax profit forecast by 14%, 
following the first-half results from the carrier, though it retains an Overweight rating on the shares.
The bank says the results may augur the first indications of disruptive industry pricing behaviour, driven by lower 
fuel prices, beyond what can be explained by a capacity-versus-demand analysis. For easyJet, that would mean the 
end to four years of consistent price increases, and it is hard to dispute that the momentum in its margin 
improvements and return on capital expenditure is slowly rapidly, Barclays says.
One explanation for the deterioration in underlying trading is that easyJet may have just had an abnormally 
excellent winter. Another, Barclays says, is that rival Ryanair Holdings' expansion plans, though not on the same 
route network, are having an impact on low-yield traffic in markets such as  London.
An equally plausible suggestion, however, is that disruptive pricing behaviour by weaker legacy carriers, with 
unhedged fuel, is rippling through the industry, even with incremental capacity.
But the bank thinks the share price decline the company suffered on Tuesday, when it finished down around 10%, 
was an over-reaction to what was ultimately a very small underlying consensus downgrade.
Margins may be approaching peak for the carrier, but they are some way from falling, Barclays says. It adds that, 
while the momentum is clearly with carriers like Ryanair and Wizz Air, easyJet's structural growth and cash 
generation story remains intact.
Barclay retains an Overweight rating but cuts its target price to 1,840 pence from 2,150 pence.
EasyJet shares are up 1.4% to 1,676.22 pence Thursday, one of the best performers in the FTSE 100.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said its traffic rose by 16% in 
April and said its load factor improved by seven percentage points.
Ryanair said traffic in the month rose to 9 million compared to 7.8 million a year earlier, with its rolling traffic to the 
end of April up by 12% to 91.8 million customers.
The carrier added its load factor improved in the month to 91%, up from 84% in April last year.
"Ryanair's April traffic grew by 16% to 9 million customers, while our load factor jumped by 7% points to 91%, 
thanks to our lower fares, our stronger forward bookings and the continuing success of our "Always Getting Better" 
customer experience improvement programme, which continues to deliver better than expected load factors on our 
significantly expanded summer schedule," said Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs.

Aer Lingus Again Backs IAG Bid, As Cost Rise Offsets Revenue Increase
Aer Lingus Again Backs IAG Bid, As Cost Rise Offsets Revenue Increase

LONDON (Alliance News) - Aer Lingus Group PLC Wednesday said it is still strongly backing the takeover offer 
made by International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC, as the Irish flag carrier said its operating loss stayed flat in 
the first quarter of 2015 as higher operating costs offset strong revenue growth.
The Irish airline reported an operating loss of EUR48.4 million in the three months to end-March, compared with 
EUR48.5 million a year earlier, as a 6.7% increase in operating costs to EUR328.4 million offset 7.9% growth in 
revenue to EUR280.0 million.
Airlines typically make little or no money during the winter months, when air travel is much slower than in the peak 
summer months. Additionally, they have extra costs in the winter months due to having to pay for things like aircraft 
de-icing and for any weather-related delays and cancellations.
Aer Lingus said the rise in operating costs reflected the impact of increased fixed costs. It did benefit from lower fuel 
prices in the quarter, although the impact was limited by the hedging it already had in place, while higher US dollar 
costs were mostly offset by higher US dollar revenue and currency hedging.
Its revenue growth was driven by a 12.9% increase in total average fare revenue per seat. That in turn was driven 
by the continued growth of its long-haul operations, where fare revenue per seat rose 20.6% and its load factor, a 
measure of how full its planes were, rose 4.0 percentage points.
Its short-haul revenue per seat rose a more modest 1.2%, while load factor was up 2.1 percentage points. 
Retail revenue per passenger, which includes on-board sales, rose 3.7% to EUR21.87, while its cargo revenue rose 
15.1%.
The airline said it ended the first quarter with net cash of EUR650.7 million, up EUR97.0 million compared with a 
year earlier.
Aer Lingus Again Backs IAG Bid, As Cost Rise Offsets Revenue Increase
"The board and management team of Aer Lingus strongly remain of the view that a combination of Aer Lingus and 
IAG has a compelling strategic rationale and will deliver significant benefits to all stakeholders in Aer Lingus," it said 
of the ongoing takeover attempt by the owner of British Airways and Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling.
The EUR1.36 billion takeover offer, or EUR2.55 per Aer Lingus share, needs to win the backing of major Aer Lingus 
shareholder Ryanair Holdings PLC, which is being forced by UK antitrust regulators to sell down its stake, as well 
as from the Irish government, another major shareholder. 
IAG has been in talks with the Irish government, which has demanded that the airline group gives more detail about 
how it would guarantee employment growth and protect Aer Lingus' routes and identity.
"The IAG offer to acquire 100% of Aer Lingus will deliver significant benefits for all Aer Lingus stakeholders. 
However, notwithstanding the opportunities that this combination will bring, we are focused on building Aer Lingus 
and improving our return on invested capital performance," Aer Lingus Chief Executive Stephen Kavanagh said.
"In the coming quarters we will focus on capitalising on peak demand opportunities, while aggressively managing 
our cost base. On short haul we will continue our demand-led strategy to drive occupancy, manage per available 
seat yield and retail revenue per passenger. On long haul, we will see the commencement of the new Washington 
route as well as increased frequencies on New York, San Francisco and Orlando routes. Overall our forward trends 
are positive," the CEO added.
Aer Lingus shares were up 0.9% at EUR2.37 in London Wednesday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The UK Competition and Markets Authority on Friday said there has been no material 
change in circumstances or any special reason for it reverse its ruling to force Ryanair Holdings PLC to sell down its 
stake in Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC.
Ryanair requested in February that the CMA, the UK's competition authority, re-examine its decision to require 
Ryanair to sell down its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus to 5%.
It argued in particular that the bid made for Aer Lingus by International Consolidated Airlines Group, the owner of 
British Airways, and the period of time since the decision was made by the Competition Commission in August 
2013, constituted a material change in circumstances and that the CMA no longer had the power to impose a 
divestment remedy on Ryanair.
The CMA said that after considering responses from Aer Lingus, IAG and the Irish government, which also holds a 
substantial stake in Aer Lingus, along with further submissions made by Ryanair, it has provisionally decided no 
material change in circumstances had taken place to force it to reverse its decision.
"We have carefully considered submissions from Ryanair and others and taken into account all the relevant 
circumstances, including the fact that the IAG bid is conditional on receiving an irrevocable commitment from 
Ryanair. Having done so, our provisional view is that neither recent events nor the time that has passed since our 
final report are reasons not to implement the divestment remedy," said Simon Polito, chairman of the CMA's 
Ryanair/Aer LIngus Inquiry Group.

Lingus Group. Ryanair shares are down 0.9% at the open, while Aer Lingus shares are off 0.7%. Shares in IAG,

The International Monetary Fund ruled out allowing Greece to delay scheduled debt repayments, while the 
European Commission voiced dissatisfaction over talks with Athens to solve Greek financial woes. IMF chief 
Christine Lagarde said that a delay in Greek payments would constitute "additional financing" to Athens. A delay 
would be "clearly not a course of action that would...be recommendable" to the IMF's board, she said. "We have 
never had an advanced economy ask for payment delays," Lagarde said.

Japan's consumer confidence improved for the fourth straight month in March, surpassing expectations, survey

December 2013, when it marked the same 41.7.

Russian President Vladimir Putin defended his decision to resurrect a deal to sell missiles to Iran, saying it

events in Yemen, such arms supplies are a deterrent," he said during his annual television call-in show about the 
deal to sell S-300 surface-to-air missiles to Iran. Saudi Arabia and eight fellow Sunni Arab countries are waging an 
air campaign in Yemen after advances by the mainly Shiite Houthi rebel movement forced President Abd Rabu 
Mansour Hadi to flee the country. The Saudis have accused Shiite Iran of aiding the Houthis. Both Tehran and the 
Houthis have denied the accusation.

2015. The company also said that with iron ore prices continuing to fall, it will continue to slash costs so as to 
maintain the margin between itself and high-cost producers. Speaking at the company's annual general meeting in 
London, Sam Walsh, chief executive officer of Rio Tinto, noted that compared to the 2012 base, the company has 
reduced its annual operating cash costs and evaluation spend by USD4.8 billion.

International Consolidates Airlines Group has turned its back on the European airlines trade body due to a row over 
the threat posed by fast-expanding Gulf-based carriers, the Financial Times reported. IAG, which owns British 
Airways and Spanish airline Iberia, said it has pulled out of the Association of European Airlines due to a difference 
of opinion. Qatar Airways acquired a stake in IAG in January, becoming its biggest shareholder, and the airline has 
attempted to pursue a conciliatory tone with the Gulf carriers, the FT said. But other European airlines have long 
complained they are not on a level playing field with the state-owned Gulf carriers.

The UK Competition and Markets Authority said there has been no material change in circumstances or any special 
reason for it reverse its ruling to force Ryanair Holdings to sell down its stake in Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group. 
Ryanair requested in February that the CMA, the UK's competition authority, re-examine its decision to require 
Ryanair to sell down its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus to 5%. It argued in particular that the bid made for Aer Lingus by 
International Consolidated Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways constituted a material change in 
circumstances. The CMA said that after considering responses from Aer Lingus, IAG and the Irish government, 
which also holds a substantial stake in Aer Lingus, along with further submissions made by Ryanair, it has 
provisionally decided no material change in circumstances had taken place to force it to reverse its decision.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Analysts are impressed with the strong position of Wizz Air in central and eastern 
European markets saying the low cost carrier is an attractive investment opportunity.
Barclays initiates coverage on Wizz Air with an Overweight rating and a price target of 1,580 pence. The bank says 
Wizz Air ranks highly among peers like easyJet and Ryanair as a high quality, structural growth investment 
opportunity with an "outstanding" ultra-low-cost business model. 
The company has also delivered a financial performance that ranks in the top tier of international budget airlines. 
Wizz achieved the highest EBITDAR in Europe at 27% and the highest return on calculated capital of 21% in 
Europe, ranking the company in the top five global airlines for its capital return.
Barclays also highlights that Wizz has a diversified networks spanning across 38 different countries in markets that 
are untapped by its competitors. The bank expects economic growth, migration and deregulation to increase the 
need for air travel in the European region. 
Barclays is also impressed with Wizz's targeted approach to its eastern European market using its local knowledge 
while persisting with its business model. Wizz has the highest aircraft and labour productivity of any airline, a cost 
base behind Ryanair with a strengthening balance sheet and robust revenue generation combining low base fares 
with best-in class ancillary generation.
Barclays cites various margin accretive opportunities as upside catalysts. These consist of fully allocated seating, 
upgrading to 230-seat A321 planes and low fuel prices unlikely to be immediately offset in lower fares, given robust 
demand and constrained capacity. 
Although the stock looks "undeniably expensive", it still trades at a 5% discount to Ryanair, according to Barclays.
However, despite Wizz experiencing an impressive post-IPO performance, the bank thinks this will limit the stock's 
short term performance heading into the summer. Easyjet remains Barclays' preferred pick.

Nomura starts Wizz at Buy with a price target of 1,800 pence, saying the carrier is "full of eastern promise" with 
attractive growth opportunities, citing its leading position in central and eastern Europe.
"We think that Wizz is exceptionally well-placed to continue to drive both market expansion and market share," 
Nomura notes.
Nomura is impressed by Wizz's three-fold growth plan of higher current route frequencies, increased routes 
between existing airports and new airport entry, alongside planned aircraft deliveries in place to support the 
expansion.
The bank also regards Wizz's network as well diversified, highlighting geopolitical concerns, mainly in the Ukraine, 
and aggressive competition as the key risks to projected growth. Nomura forecasts a strong period of network, 
revenue and net income growth and a compound annual growth rate of 30% to strengthen a healthy cash position. 
The stocks has an implied 10% discount compared to Ryanair.
Wizz Air shares were up 1% to 1,465.00 pence on Friday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - JP Morgan has realigned its European Airline sector ratings, saying it prefers low-cost 
carriers as they offer superior risk/reward and continued growth potential.
On the other hand, the bank says traditional carriers remain exposed to unrelenting Middle Eastern competition and 
suffer from stagnating margins.
"Capacity between Western Europe and the Middle East continues to grow at a 15% annual rate. Considering that 
FX is negating most (but not all) of the benefit of lower fuel, European legacy margins are likely to show little if any 
progress in coming years, in our view," says Jamie Baker, an analyst at JP Morgan. 
The bank lowers its rating on International Consolidated Airlines Group to Neutral from Overweight, but raises its 
price target on the stock to EUR8.50 from EUR5.50. The stock is quoted at EUR8.16 on the Madrid stock 
exchange, and trades down 2.5% at 583.50 pence in London, Tuesday morning.
Meanwhile, the bank reiterates its Overweight rating on easyJet and raises its price target to 2,050.00 pence from 
1,815.0.0p. The budget airline trades down 1.0% at 1,826.40p.
JP Morgan raises Ryanair Holdings to Overweight from Neutral and raises its price target to EUR13.00 from 
EUR8.50. The company trades down 0.2% at EUR10.84.
In addition, the bank initiates Wizz Air Holdings at Overweight and a 1,700.00 pence price target. 
"While its model is by no means proprietary, [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and 
Restructuring] margins rival those of Ryanair, and its growth prospects, as defined by underlying economic trends in 
markets served, are superior to those of Western European [low cost carriers], in our view," Baker says. 
Citigroup has also initiated Wizz at Buy, with a 1,630.00p price target.

"Central and Eastern Europe (CEE excluding Russia and Turkey) offers substantial air traffic growth and Wizz Air, 
the largest LCC and airline in the region, is best placed to seize this growth opportunity," says Citi analyst Andrew 
Light. "It is one of the most profitable and fastest-growing airlines globally."
Wizz Air trades up 0.3% at 1,428.57p.

UK economic growth held steady in the three months to the end of March and is expected to gather momentum in 
the coming quarter, the Confederation of British Industry said. The CBI's Growth Indicator, a survey of 764 
businesses in the UK, showed an overall reading of +18% for the three months to March, meaning private sector 
growth was nearly unchanged from the +19% measurement shown in the three months to the end of February. But 
the CBI said businesses expect UK growth to strengthen in coming months, with the balance of expectations for 
growth in the three months from April to June at +25%. This will be driven by a pick-up in business and professional 
and consumer services activity in the manufacturing sector, the CBI said.

Ryanair Holdings said its traffic increased year-on-year in March and said its load factor rose by 10 percentage 
points. The Irish budget carrier said its traffic increased to 6.67 million customers in March, up 28% from the 5.2

from US dollar loan revaluation. But the adjusted pretax profit would include the GBP10 million writedown on its 
Finland joint venture and the GBP6 million provision made on flight delays. The company said it delivered 15%

Confirming media speculation, US logistics giant FedEx Corp and European peer TNT Express said they have

projected to report its sixth consecutive quarter of decline in earnings.

Chemicals giant DuPont Co said that activist investment firm Trian Fund Management LP's proposal to break up 
the company would cost USD4 billion. DuPont said that Trian is pushing a value-destructive agenda to break up the

weaker prospects for value creation. The agenda carries extensive risks as well as estimated upfront monetary 
impact of USD4 billion and estimated ongoing increased costs of USD1 billion annually.

LONDON MORNING BRIEFING: IAG Down, Ryannair Up On JPMorgan Ratings
Ryanair Holdings said its traffic increased year-on-year in March and said its load factor rose by 10 percentage 
points. The Irish budget carrier said its traffic increased to 6.67 million customers in March, up 28% from the 5.2 
million customers it carried a year earlier. The company said its rolling annual traffic to March grew 11% to 90.5 
million. Ryanair said its load factor also improved significantly in the month year-on-year, up to 90% from 80% a 
year ago.
----------
Flybe Group said it expects to report full-year results in line with market expectations following a return to growth in 
the final quarter of its financial year to the end of March. The European regional carrier said it expects to be around 
breakeven on its adjusted pretax profit, excluding the GBP26 million cost of its Embraer E195 jets and any impact 
from US dollar loan revaluation. But the adjusted pretax profit would include the GBP10 million writedown on its 
Finland joint venture and the GBP6 million provision made on flight delays. The company said it delivered 15% 
additional capacity in the fourth quarter, with load factors held flat amid similar 15% passenger growth. Overall, 
revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 5%.
----------
LXB Retail Properties said it has exchanged contracts on its Biggleswade and Rushden investments on a forward-
funding basis and intends to use the proceeds from the two disposals to return cash to shareholders. LXB said it is 
selling its entire investment in Biggleswade, primarily the A1 Retail Park, for GBP58.5 million, with a further 
GBP10.2 million due upon practical completion of the deal and a further GBP11.3 million due linked to the final 
investment appraisal. The company also has struck a deal to sell the Rushden Lakes leisure and shopping site in 
Northamptonshire to The Crown Estate for GBP70 million, reflecting an underlying overall yield of 4.65% for the 
retail elements.
----------
Identity data company GB Group said it expects to beat market expectations for its financial year to the end of 
March on the back of strong organic and acquisition-driven growth. GB said it expects its adjusted operating profit 
for the year to be GBP10.2 million, up around 46% from the GBP7.2 million posted a year earlier and ahead of 
market consensus. According to Morningstar, the consensus forecast for pretax profit for the company is GBP9.5 
million.
----------
First Property Group said it expects results for its recently completed financial year to be in line with market 
expectations. The property fund manager and investor said that trading and pretax profit for the year ended March 
31 are both expected to be in line with what the market has been forecasting. In addition, the group said it had 
some GBP12 million in cash at the end of the financial year, giving it the capacity to make new investments.

COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL

Confirming media speculation, US logistics giant FedEx Corp and European peer TNT Express said they have 
reached an agreement for FedEx to buy TNT for an all-cash public offer of EUR8 per TNT share. The transaction 
represents an implied equity value of EUR4.4 billion for TNT Express. The offer represents a premium of 33% over 
TNT's closing price of EUR6 per share in Amsterdam on Thursday. The transaction has been unanimously 
recommended by TNT Express' executive board and supervisory board. PostNL also has irrevocably confirmed to 
support the offer and tender its 14.7% shareholding in TNT. 
----------
South Korean conglomerate Samsung Electronics said it expects operating profit for the first quarter to decline 31% 
year-over year and sales to fall 12%. However, operating profit is projected to grow sequentially. The operating 
profit forecast tops current analysts' expectations, while sales guidance is below estimates. The company is 
scheduled to report financial results for the first quarter in late April. Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung is now 
projected to report its sixth consecutive quarter of decline in earnings.
----------
Chemicals giant DuPont Co said that activist investment firm Trian Fund Management LP's proposal to break up 
the company would cost USD4 billion. DuPont said that Trian is pushing a value-destructive agenda to break up the 
company and add excessive debt to DuPont, which the board believes will result in a less competitive company with 
weaker prospects for value creation. The agenda carries extensive risks as well as estimated upfront monetary 
impact of USD4 billion and estimated ongoing increased costs of USD1 billion annually.

expanded winter schedule," said Ryanair Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs.

Germanwings Co-Pilot Under Scrutiny As Investigation Continues
Germanwings Co-Pilot Under Scrutiny As Investigation Continues

Berlin/Paris (Alliance News) - Investigations into this week's fatal crash of Germanwings flight 4U9525 focused 
Friday on the background of the co-pilot, who has been accused of deliberately downing the plane and killing all 
150 people on board.
French and German prosecutors were looking into the background of Andreas Lubitz, 27, to ascertain why he may 
have wanted to take his life and murder 149 others after a voice recording showed that he purposefully locked the 
flight commander out of the cockpit and activated the descent.
Parent company Lufthansa's chief executive Carsten Spohr said on Thursday that Lubitz had interrupted his 
aviation training in 2009, but refused to say why. Speculation was rife about the pilot's psychological state leading 
up to the incident.
Meanwhile, airlines around the world were scrambling to introduce new rules to increase aviation safety by ensuring 
that there are always two crew members present in the cockpit.
Emergency codes allow crew members to enter the cockpit when a pilot becomes incapacitated, but Lubitz is 
thought to have overridden this system, which was put in place after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the 
US.
Norwegian Air Shuttle was one of the first carriers to introduce the so-called "rule of two," with Britain's Easyjet and 
Air Canada following suit. Ryanair said Friday that it had already required two people to be present in the cockpit at 
all times.
The German Aviation Association (BDL) was set to discuss the new rule with the country's civil aviation authority on 
Friday, with German carriers expected to change its procedures shortly thereafter.
BDL represents Lufthansa, by far Germany's biggest airline, as well as Air Berlin, charter airlines Condor and TuiFly 
and smaller regional companies.
Germanwings Co-Pilot Under Scrutiny As Investigation Continues
Also on Friday, data from the transponder of the Germanwings plane confirmed that someone had manually altered 
the autopilot altitude to less than 100 feet (30 metres), a flight data organization said.
"Between 09:30:52 and 09:30:55 we can see that the autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 feet to 100 feet," 
said the post by FlightRadar24, which tracks aviation traffic, late Thursday.
"Nine seconds later the aircraft started to descend, probably with the 'open descent' autopilot setting," it said.
Flight 4U9525 left Barcelona around 10 am (0900 GMT) on Tuesday, and disappeared from radar around an hour 
later before crashing into a mountainside 165 kilometres north-east of the southern French city of Marseille.
The FlightRadar24 data was collected from the transponder's automated responses to interrogating radar requests.
There were 150 people on the plane, including some 75 Germans, 50 Spaniards, and over a dozen other 
nationalities, records show.

Germanwings : European Airlines Scramble To Change Cockpit Rules

COLOGNE (Alliance News) - The Germanwings plane crash has spurred European airlines to implement stringent 
cockpit rules widely followed in the US, after it emerged a lone co-pilot forced the plane into its fatal descent, 
reports said on Thursday.
Airline passengers are in a state of fear after a probe blamed Andreas Lubitz - the 27-year-old co-pilot of the 
Germanwings flight - for wantonly causing the crash, after he grabbed the chance to lock himself in the cockpit 
when the pilot had gone to the lavatory.
That has stirred airlines in Canada and Europe into incorporating a US rule that a commercial pilot just can't be left 
alone in the cockpit.
Four airliners, including EasyJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle, are reported to have announced they would implement 
the new cockpit rules, Bloomberg said.
Air Canada would implement the change without delay, while the UK's EasyJet PLC will adopt the standard Friday.
While it is piquant that the absence of such a measure gave the co-pilot the chance to commit the crash, it also 
provides a sense of security that now onwards such dastardly incidents do not recur.
Apparently, the Germanwings crash has infused a sense of urgency and stirred countries into action on a war 
footing. Worldover, it's up to an airline to decide whether to allow a pilot alone in the cockpit.
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is mulling on adequate safety measures that need to be taken in 
light of the crash.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority is reported to have asked airlines to consider implementing the policy that a cockpit 
have two people at all times. Air France is also reported to be toeing the line and has been in touch with EASA.
Germanwings : European Airlines Scramble To Change Cockpit Rules
Germanwings parent Deutsche Lufthansa AG's rules allow the pilot or co-pilot to be alone on the cockpit for a short 
time, and that policy hasn't changed at the airline.
Air Berlin PLC said that as of Friday two staff members would always be in the cockpit even if the pilot or co-pilot 
stepped out. Ryanair Holdings PLC reportedly has such a policy.
The ill-fated Airbus A320, from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, began to descend from a high altitude after losing radio 
contact and crashed into the French alps on Tuesday morning, killing all 150 people on board.
Information from the black box cockpit voice recorder showed that the co-pilot did not say a word after the pilot left 
the cockpit. The pilot then speaks tries to contact the co-pilot over an interphone, but there is no response and only 
his breathing could be heard. The audio also has sounds of desperate passengers in their final moments.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum raises International Consolidated Airlines Group's price target to 700 pence 
from 600p, reiterating its Buy recommendation, saying the parent company of British Airways and Spanish airlines 
Iberia and Vueling is "climbing away" from its peers. 
The broker says there is a growing gap between the financial performance of IAG and those of its European 
network peers. "IAG has a better [return on invested capital], higher margins and superior strategic positioning," 
says Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo. 
Liberum says IAG's financial performance has been considerably stronger than that of Air France-KLM and 
Lufthansa in the past, and the broker sees this gap widening in the future. 
The broker believes the toughest part of IAG's restructuring is in the past, even if Iberia's transformation is not yet 
complete.  
Liberum raises its IAG revenue expectations for 2015 by 3% to EUR21.3 million, and its 2016 revenue estimates 
also by 3% to EUR22.3 million. The broker raises its 2015 earnings per share expectations by 33% to 75.6 cents 
and its 2016 earnings per share expectations by 39% to 96.1 cents.
The broker sees the backing of the Irish government as crucial to the successful completion of the proposed 
acquisition for Aer Lingus, and the profitable ownership of it thereafter. 
"If the Irish government's backing can be secured, we would expect Ryanair (which holds 29% of Aer Lingus) to be 
supportive of the deal too," writes Khoo.
"Although the deal would create a stronger competitor for Ryanair, it is under pressure from a UK Competition and 
Markets Authority ruling that it must divest most of its stake. Selling its stake to IAG in a takeover with a premium 
would be preferable to selling in the market at a lower price after a deal had failed," says Khoo.  
IN THE KNOW: IAG Is "Climbing Away" From Its Peers - Liberum
Earlier this month, Irish Transport minister Paschal Donoghue said the government's engagement with IAG has 
been positive and the airline's bid to buy Aer Lingus appears to be "friendly", but it said it wanted the airline group to 
expand on what it will do to create employment and protect the Irish flag carrier's identity and routes.
In February, Aer Lingus backed the EUR1.36 billion takeover bid from IAG.
IAG shares are down 0.3% at 592.00p Monday afternoon, having risen by 61% in the past six months and more 
than tripled in the past three years.  Aer Lingus shares are up 1.4% at EUR2.38.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets are poised to open flat to slightly higher on Friday as investors 
await fresh triggers to sustain recent sharp gains. While the odds of a June hike have faded, the FOMC statement 
and the change in wordings failed to clear up market confusion about timing of rate rise.
Oil prices rebounded slightly from overnight losses as the dollar weakened in the wake of hesitant signals from the 
Fed. Gold prices remain flat near two-week high amid the reduced threat of higher rates. Copper eased after rising 
the most in six weeks yesterday on news from Indonesia that production has been halted at Freeport-McMoRan 
Inc's copper mine.
Asian stocks are mixed following a lackluster lead from Wall Street overnight. China's Shanghai Composite index is 
up nearly a percent as speculation intensified that the government will unveil additional stimulus measures to 
support the property market.
Japan's Nikkei index rose 0.4% while Australian shares also finished higher after a shaky start, led by a late rally in 
banks. The markets elsewhere in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea are subdued.
The US economic calendar remains light today after mostly weak data yesterday.
Closer home, survey figures released by Knight Frank and Markit Economics showed that majority of households in 
the UK perceive that the value of their houses increased in March after some moderation in the previous month. 
The house price sentiment index rose to 57.5 from 56.5 in February.
European leaders have yet to unlock the last tranche of EUR 240 billion bailout aid to Greece. Following marathon 
talks between Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders in 
Brussels, Merkel said the Greek government will take full responsibility for the reforms and submit a list of reforms 
in the coming days to secure the additional bailout funds required to prevent bankruptcy.
In corporate news, Dutch consumer electronics company Koninklijke Philips NV has unveiled plans to separate its 
lighting business through an initial public offering in the first half of 2016.
European Stocks Seen Flat-to-higher
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, said that it has no plans to operate transatlantic flights.
Evotec AG has signed a definitive agreement with French drug maker Sanofi for a major multi-component strategic 
alliance over the next five years.
An asthma treatment co-developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Theravance has been found safe and effective by a 
FDA review panel in treating patients aged 18 years and older.
The European markets ended Thursday's session on a mixed note as continued weakness in oil prices and 
concerns over Greece's debt crisis offset positive market reaction to the Federal Reserve's dovish statement. While 
the German DAX slipped 0.2%, France's CAC 40 edged up 0.1% and the UK's FTSE 100 rose 0.3%.
US stocks ended a lackluster session mixed on Thursday as a stronger dollar pulled down commodity prices and a 
slew of lackluster economic reports pointed to slowing momentum in the world's largest economy. Investors were 
worried about possible volatility across asset classes as the Fed raises interest rates in coming months. While the 
tech-heavy Nasdaq edged up 0.2%, the Dow slid 0.7% and the S&P 500 eased half a percent.

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, plans to launch cheap 
transatlantic flights to as many as 14 US cities from Europe in four to five years' time, subject to acquisition of viable 
long-haul aircraft.
"The board of Ryanair, like any PLC, has approved the business plans for future growth, including transatlantic," 
said the company in a statement. "We are talking to manufacturers about long-haul aircraft but can't comment 
further on this. European consumers want lower cost travel to the USA and the same for Americans coming to 
Europe. We see it as a logical development in the European market."
"We would like to offer low-cost flights between 12 to 14 European cities and 12 to 14 US cities. The business plan 
is there but it's dependent on attaining viable long-haul aircraft and we estimate that's four to five years away."
Ryanair did not name the US cities it plans to connect, but reports said the list includes Boston, New York, Chicago, 
and Miami.
Although some subsidised promotional fares would cost GBP10, other one-way tickets would be priced at GBP99 
or more, and the Irish carrier would fill up to half its aircraft with more expensive premium seats, Ryanair's head of 
marketing Kenny Jacobs was reported as saying.
Founded in 1985, Ryanair has a fleet of more than 300 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and operates more than 1,600 
scheduled short-haul flights per day serving about 189 airports mainly in Europe.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets are set for a positive open on Wednesday as investors look 
ahead to a key Federal Reserve meeting later today that could set the stage for the first US interest rate hike since 
2006.
Looking past the dollar's strength, most economists expect the Fed to drop its "patient" language form the policy 
statement, paving the way for a rate hike in June or September. The FOMC statement as well as Fed Chair Janet 
Yellen's comments at the press conference will be scrutinized for any shift in tone, especially in light of the recent 
mixed economic indicators.
On the US earnings front, Oracle Corp. reported flat quarterly results, while Adobe Systems posted first-quarter 
results that beat analyst estimates across the board.
Closer home, minutes of Bank of England's March policy meeting are due to be published today. Besides, investors 
await UK employment data and Eurozone trade figures for further clues to the region's economic outlook. British 
finance minister George Osborne will present the annual UK budget statement later today against a backdrop of a 
strengthening economic recovery.
In news out of Greece, the debt-laden country has frustrated its main creditors on Tuesday by refusing to update 
euro zone peers on its reform progress at a scheduled teleconference, media reports suggest. Asian stocks are 
trading mixed and the dollar held steady, while crude prices extended losses on industry data showing a build in 
crude oil stocks last week. It is feared that a possible deal over Iran's nuclear program could lead to the easing of 
sanctions that in turn would flood world markets with more oil.
The safe-have Japanese yen held steady against the dollar after official figures showed Japanese exports rose 
more than forecast in February. Chinese shares are rallying on stimulus hopes after a report showed China's 
average new home prices fell at the fastest pace on record in February from a year earlier. Elsewhere, data out of 
South Korea showed that the country's jobless rate hit a five-year high in February.
European Stocks Seen Steady Ahead Of Fed Decision
In domestic corporate news, Ireland's budget airline Ryanair said it would launch cheap transatlantic flights to as 
many as 14 US cities from Europe in four to five years' time, subject to acquisition of viable long-haul aircraft.
Dragon Oil PLC confirmed that it had been approached by Dubai's Emirates National Oil Company, its largest 
shareholder, regarding a possible offer for its shares that it does not already own.
Reinsurer Swiss Re said it would propose the previously announced share buyback of up to 1.0 billion francs at the 
next annual general meeting.
Lufthansa's pilot union Vereinigung Cockpit has called for a strike Wednesday and Thursday over a months-long 
row over retirement benefits.
The European markets turned in a mixed performance on Tuesday after data showed German investor confidence 
rose by less than expected in March and Eurozone employment growth slowed in the fourth quarter. The 
eurozone's inflation rate has been confirmed at minus 0.3% in February, up from minus 0.6% in January, a sign that 
deflationary pressures may be easing. The German DAX dropped 1.5% and France's CAC 40 shed 0.6%, while the 
FTSE 100 of the UK advanced half a percent.
US stocks ended Tuesday's choppy session mixed after the prior day's rally. Economic reports painted a mixed 
picture of the economy, with housing starts slumping the most in four years in February due to fierce winter 
weather, while an increase in building permits was driven by applications for multifamily units. While the tech-heavy 
Nasdaq rose 0.2%, the Dow slid 0.7% and the S&P 500 eased 0.3%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The board of Ryanair Holdings PLC has approved plans to start offering a transatlantic 
service as part of the growth strategy for the low-cost carrier over the next five years, the Financial Times reported 
on Monday.
Ryanair has outlined proposals for transatlantic flights with tickets costing as little at GBP10, though some fares will 
be much higher, the FT said.
The carrier is studying plans to fly between around a dozen European and US cities on a service which could start 
up within four-to-five years if Ryanair can reach a deal to acquire long-haul aircraft from Airbus or Boeing.

The three new Boeing 737-800s are worth USD280 million at current list prices, but airlines typically get a hefty 
discount on the list prices, particularly on larger orders.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Investec re-initiates coverage on Ryanair Holdings with a Buy recommendation and 
EUR13 target price and says momentum is building for the low-cost Irish carrier. Ryanair shares were trading flat at 
EUR9.949 on Tuesday afternoon.
The broker says the revamped product offering for Ryanair, primarily the introduction of a business class service 
last year, should drive a higher load factor, lower unit costs, allow the company to be the leader on pricing, and 
drive gains in market share.
Investec says the arrival of Boeing MAX jets in Ryanair's 2020 financial year will "further reinforce a best in class 
unit cost platform". Moreover, the broker sees an opportunity for Ryanair to generate a substantial profit from the 
sale of aircraft as part of its fleet rollover programme.
Investec forecasts lease-adjusted return on capital expenditure to increase from 23.6% in 2015 to 30.8% by 2024, 
primarily driven by a stronger load factor and improved revenue per aircraft.
The broker adds Ryanair is trading at 14.4x 2016 earnings, cheap against its recent history, and says its returns-
based discounted cash flow target price of EUR13 per share implies a total shareholder return of 32%, driving its 
Buy recommendation.

The bond will be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange which offers access to investors both in Europe and the rest of

UPDATE: Ryanair Asks UK Regulator To Reconsider Aer Lingus Decision
UPDATE: Ryanair Asks UK Regulator To Reconsider Aer Lingus Decision

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Tuesday asked the UK antitrust regulator to reconsider a 
decision requiring Europe's largest low-cost carrier to sell down most of its near 29.9% stake in Irish flag carrier Aer 
Lingus PLC.
In a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority, Ryanair argued that International Consolidated Airlines 
Group PLC's bid to acquire Aer Lingus has disproved one of the key reasons behind the regulator's order that 
Ryanair sell at least 25% of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair built up its stake in Aer Lingus when it previously unsuccessfully tried to acquire its Irish rival. It was 
blocked several times in its attempts by regulators and by Aer Lingus shareholders including the Irish government.
The CMA's predecessor as UK antitrust regulator, the now closed Competition Commission, then ordered Ryanair 
to reduce its Aer Lingus stake after concluding that it resulted in substantial lessening of competition in the UK, 
including preventing Aer Lingus from merging with, or being bought by, other airlines.
"In reaching its conclusion – now shown to be wrong – the Competition Commission relied on submissions by 
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA that it did not propose to acquire Aer Lingus and that it would “not 
usually contemplate buying a controlling interest in an airline with a significant ongoing minority shareholder.” The 
evidence of IAG was especially significant because IAG is one of the three major airline groups in Europe, operates 
extensively in the UK and Ireland, has substantial resources and network, and is an important competitor to 
Ryanair," the low-cost carrier said in its submission to the CMA Tuesday.
"The findings in the Final Report have now been contradicted and disproven by events, which demonstrate 
conclusively that Ryanair’s shareholding in Aer Lingus does not prevent Aer Lingus from merging with, being 
acquired by, or otherwise entering into combinations with other airlines, and which fatally undermine the lawfulness 
of the proposed divestment remedy," it added. 
UPDATE: Ryanair Asks UK Regulator To Reconsider Aer Lingus Decision
IAG has made a EUR1.36 billion takeover offer for Aer Lingus, which the Irish flag carrier's board is supporting. 
However, the owner of British Airways and Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling still needs to get the backing of the 
Irish government if it is to complete a deal. The Irish Ministry of Finance has a 25.17% stake in Aer Lingus.
IAG has been trying to secure the support of the Irish government by promising to protect Aer Lingus' identity and 
key routes, particularly between Ireland and London Heathrow, if the takeover goes ahead. However, the 
government has yet to decide whether these guarantees will be enough to get its backing.
"The reaction of the Irish Government to these announcements has confirmed what Ryanair always said (and the 
Competition Commission dismissed), namely that the Irish Government, and not
Ryanair, represented the only obstacle to Aer Lingus’ combination with any other airline," Ryanair said in its 
submission.
The CMA said that interested parties have until March 17 to respond to Ryanair's submission.
Ryanair shares were down 0.2% at EUR9.93 in London Tuesday afternoon, while Aer Lingus shares were down 
16% at EUR2.32. IAG shares were down 2.2% at 561.50 pence.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday submitted an appeal to the UK's Competition and 
Markets Authority to reconsider its 2013 decision ordering the low-cost carrier to sell down its stake in Aer Lingus 
Group PLC to 5%.
Ryanair said in its appeal that the fact International Consolidated Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, has 
secured the support of the Aer Lingus board for a EUR1.36 billion takeover offer disproves the point made by the 
competition regulator that Ryanair's 30% stake in the Irish flag carrier would be a deterrent to Aer Lingus merging or 
being taken over by another carrier.
Ryanair said it is confident that a re-examination of the case would vindicate its position and would make the 
Competition and Markets Authority overturn the decision made by the Competition Commission in 2013.
Ryanair shares were up 0.2% to EUR9.957 on Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The Court of Appeal has rejected Ryanair's challenge of a Competition Appeal Tribunal 
ruling that it must sell most of its 29% stake in Aer Lingus Group PLC, and refused permission for Ryanair to appeal 
to the supreme court. 
The Competition and Markets Authority ruled that Ryanair's holding in Aer Lingus was anti-competitive, and 
required it to sell down its stake in the company to 5%. 
Ryanair said it will now appeal the case to the UK Supreme Court, saying it "raises human rights issues of 
significant public importance, including the scope of protection offered to businesses by the right to property." It has 
also requested a formal review of the CMA of its final report, and a withdrawal of its call for Ryanair to sell its sake, 
in light of the recent offers from International Airlines Group for Aer Lingus.
IAG made a sweetened EUR1.36 billion bid for the Irish airline in January. IAG, which also owns Spanish airlines 
Iberia and Vueling, raised its bid for Aer Lingus for a second time, and is now offering EUR2.55 a share in cash in 
total. That figure includes a cash dividend of EUR0.05 a share.
At that time Aer Lingus' board said it would be willing to recommend the bid. 
Ryanair claims that the IAG's offers "fully disprove" the theories the final report was based on, proving that its 
shareholding is not a deterrent for merging or bidding for Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus welcomed the court of appeal's decision, noting that it was the third time the court of appeal has 
"rejected Ryanair's attempts to derail the UK competition authorities' investigations and findings."
Shares in Ryanair are trading down 0.5% at 9.69 pence Thursday morning, Aer Lingus is up 1.5% at EUR2.21.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum believes that cheaper fuel is not the clear positive some would believe it to be 
for the airline industry, as pressure builds for lower fares. 
"We envisage a two-way pull between lower costs on the one hand and lower fares and higher capacity on the 
other. On balance, the industry should retain at least some benefit from a 50% fall in fuel costs, assuming current 
prices persist beyond the expiry of current expensive hedges (typically up to two years)," says Liberum analyst 
Gerald Khoo.  
Liberum reiterates its Buy ratings on EasyJet and Ryanair, saying that strongest and most efficient airlines will 
remain winners in the current climate. 
Khoo says easyJet's first quarter update last week was encouraging but visibility for the key summer period remains 
limited. 
The analyst adds that extensive hedging means that the benefits of cheaper fuel will not come through in the short-
term. "However, even if the industry adds capacity and dilutes average fares, we expect financially strong and 
efficient airlines like easyJet to come out on top," Khoo says.
Liberum raises its price target for the budget airline to 2,000.00 pence from 1,725.00p.
EasyJet trades down 0.9% at 1,710.00 pence early Friday. 
Khoo expects that some of the fuel cost savings which Ryanair will experience will be passed onto customers 
through lower fares. "There may also be some dislocation to pricing and capacity discipline if inefficient capacity 
persists for longer," the analyst adds. 
However, Khoo still believes that Ryanair will be a long-term winner, saying it is successfully pursuing 
improvements in unit revenue, through better airports, more business travellers and higher load factors.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Cantor Fitzgerald lifts its target price on Ryanair and reiterates its Buy rating on the 
stock, saying it is struggling to see many dark clouds on the horizon for the budget carrier.
Cantor says Ryanair's growth in passenger numbers and load factor remains strong and it is struggling to see any 
major obstacles to further growth.
New routes and operating bases added in the past year should support strong growth in 2015, while healthy cash 
generation should support further buybacks and special dividends.
Cantor says Ryanair is trading at 14 times 2015 earnings against a sector average of 12.6 times, yet its premium is 
justified given its offers "superior earnings growth and higher potential cash returns".
It reiterates its Buy recommendation on the airline and hikes its price target to EUR12 from EUR10.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Wednesday reported strong growth in passenger numbers in 
January, and said its planes were more full than a year earlier, confirming a trend it reported on Monday when it 
reported its third quarter results.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier said passenger numbers were up by 1.3 million on the year in January to over 5.98 
million, while its load factor rose to 83%, from 71% a year earlier. Passenger numbers in the 12 months to the end 
of January were 87.8 million, up 8% on the previous 12 months.
Ryanair has been citing its recently-launched business traveller offering and a move to improve its all-round 
customer service for the improvement in load factors, while passenger numbers continue rising as it adds new 
routes.
On Monday, it raised its full-year guidance for a fourth time in the past six months on the back of falling fuel prices 
and said it swung to a profit in the third quarter of the financial year compared with a loss a year earlier.
The airline reported a EUR49 million profit for the three months to December 31, its fiscal third quarter, compared 
with a loss of EUR35 million a year earlier. Revenue rose to EUR1.13 billion, from EUR964 million, as passenger 
numbers rose to 20.8 million, from 18.3 million.
However, its had urged shareholders and analysts to temper their expectations for its next financial year, fiscal 
2016. It said it expects profit growth next year to be modest, and said it expects fares to come under pressure 
because some rivals who haven't hedged forward fuel needs will benefit from the full impact of the recent oil price 
declines and will lower fares.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish airline Ryanair Holdings PLC Monday announced a EUR400 million share 
buyback, as it raised its full-year guidance for a fourth time on the back of falling fuel prices and said it swung to a 
profit in the third quarter of the financial year compared with a loss a year earlier.
However, its shares fell as it urged shareholders and analysts to temper their expectations for its next financial year, 
fiscal 2016. It said it expects profit growth next year to be modest, and said it expects fares to come under pressure 
because some rivals who haven't hedged forward fuel needs will benefit from the full impact of the recent oil price 
declines and will lower fares.
Europe's low-cost carrier said it had already noticed some softening in prices on forward bookings during the first 
few weeks of January, but it is now expecting a 5% decline in unit costs for the financial year as a whole. It is 
therefore raising its net profit guidance for the year to end-March to between EUR840 million and EUR850 million, 
from its previous guidance of between EUR810 million and EUR830 million.
The airline hedges most of its fuel needs, meaning prices are locked in, but about 10% of its fuel needs are 
unhedged, and therefore it's feeling some of the benefit from the recent steep fall in oil prices.
Ryanair said it will start a EUR400 million share buyback on February 12 which will last for six months. It said the 
move reflects its improved profitability and cash flow. That's on top of the EUR520 million, or EUR0.375 a share, 
special dividend that it had previously announced and that it will pay on February 27.
The airline reported a EUR49 million profit for the three months to December 31, its fiscal third quarter, compared 
with a loss of EUR35 million a year earlier. Revenue rose to EUR1.13 billion, from EUR964 million, as passenger 
numbers rose to 20.8 million, from 18.3 million. Basic earnings per share were 3.53 euro cents, compared with a 
loss of 2.50 cents.
Airlines and travel companies traditionally make little or no money during the winter months, making most of their 
profits in the summer months when demand is at its peak.
UPDATE: Ryanair Raises Fiscal 2015 Guidance Again, Cautious On 2016
The company also cited higher load factors for the profit improvement, saying its recently-launched service aimed at 
business travellers and improvements to its general customer service were pulling in more passengers and 
ensuring its planes are more full. Its third-quarter load factor rose to 88%, from 82% a year earlier.
"Our new winter routes and bases are performing well.  Our significantly expanded winter schedule, which includes 
more primary airports, city pairs and business friendly frequencies has converted millions of new customers to flying 
Ryanair.  3 new bases in Bratislava, Copenhagen and Ponta Delgada (Azores) will open in March/April with the 
benefit of stronger than expected forward bookings as the Ryanair low fare brand is already well known in these 
countries," Ryanair said in a statement.
Ryanair had previously raised its full-year guidance in early December, citing the rise in passenger numbers after it 
launched its business service. It had also raised guidance in early November, after reporting strong growth in profit 
and revenue in the first half, driven by higher passenger numbers, average fares and lower fuel costs, after first 
raising guidance in September. 
However, it's being cautious about its next financial year. 
"As lower oil prices kick in over the next two years, Ryanair intends to pass on much, if not all, of these savings to 
our rapidly growing customer base in the form of lower fares and therefore our profit growth expectations will be 
modest in fiscal-year 2016," Ryanair said.
The airline said it has taken advantage of the recent dips in oil prices to further extend its fuel hedges into the 
financial year ending in 2017. It is 90% hedged for the current year at USD95 a barrel and for next year at USD92 a 
barrel. It's now 35% hedged for fiscal 2017 at approximately USD68 a barrel.  
It said its US dollar operational expenditure is 90% hedged at USD1.33 for fiscal 2016, and 60% hedged at 
USD1.21 in fiscal 2017, which would deliver an indicative reduction in its fuel cost per passenger of approximately 
8% in fiscal 2016 and approximately 16% in fiscal 2017. Its capital expenditure programme is fully hedged to 
September 2017 at a rate of USD1.35, which locks in significantly lower cost aircraft deliveries over the next two 
years.  
Ryanair declined to comment further on International Consolidated Airline Group SA's attempt to acquire Irish flag 
carrier Aer Lingus, in which Ryanair is the biggest shareholder. 
"Since Ryanair has received no formal approach, or offer for our shares in Aer Lingus, we will not engage in any 
speculation about this proposal, other than to restate our position which is that the Board of Ryanair will carefully 
consider any such offer, should one be received, from IAG or any other party, in due course," it said.   
Ryanair shares were down 3.8% at 10.01 pence Tuesday morning, on the back of the cautious guidance for fiscal 
2016. 
"We suspect this is an attempt to keep a lid on fuel-driven upgrades," Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said of the 
caution on fiscal 2016. Khoo, who is retaining a Buy rating on the stock with a EUR10.50 price target, added that 
while Ryanair trades at a deserved clear premium to the rest of the European airlines sector, there is limited scope 
for significant re-rating from here, and management's caution may restrain earnings upgrades. 
Cantor Fitzgerald also reiterated its Buy rating on Ryanair, and put its EUR10 price target under review, saying that 
the airline's third-quarter results beat its expectations. However, Cantor analyst Robin Byde sees scope for small 
upgrades to consensus for financial years 2015-17 after management raised its full-year guidance for fiscal 2015.

Ryanair said it will pay a special dividend of EUR520 million, or EUR0.375 a share, on February 27, and will also 
start a EUR400 million share bauyback on February 12 which will last for six months. It said the move reflects its 
improved profitability and cash flow.
The airline reported a EUR49 million profit for the three months to December 31, its fiscal third quarter, compared 
with a loss of EUR35 million a year earlier. Revenue rose to EUR1.13 billion, from EUR964 million, as passenger 
numbers rose to 20.8 million, from 18.3 million. Basic earnings per share were 3.53 euro cents, compared with a 
loss of 2.50 cents.
Airlines and travel companies traditionally make little or no money during the winter months, making most of their 
profits in the summer months when demand is at its peak.
The company also cited higher load factors for the profit improvement, saying its recently-launched service aimed at 
business travellers and improvements to its general customer service were pulling in more passengers and 
ensuring its planes are more full. Its third-quarter load factor rose to 88%, from 82% a year earlier.
Ryanair Raises Guidance Again, Helped By Lower Fuel Prices
"Our new winter routes and bases are performing well.  Our significantly expanded winter schedule, which includes 
more primary airports, city pairs and business friendly frequencies has converted millions of new customers to flying 
Ryanair.  3 new bases in Bratislava, Copenhagen and Ponta Delgada (Azores) will open in March/April with the 
benefit of stronger than expected forward bookings as the Ryanair low fare brand is already well known in these 
countries," Ryanair said in a statement.
The airline said it has taken advantage of the recent dips in oil prices to further extend its fuel hedges into the 
financial year ending in 2017.  It is 90% hedged for the current year at USD95 a barrel and for next year at USD92 
a barrel. It's now 35% hedged for fiscal 2017 at approximately USD68 a barrel.  
Ryanair declined to comment further on International Consolidated Airline Group SA's attempt to acquire Irish flag 
carrier Aer Lingus, in which Ryanair is the biggest shareholder. 
"Since Ryanair has received no formal approach, or offer for our shares in Aer Lingus, we will not engage in any 
speculation about this proposal, other than to restate our position which is that the Board of Ryanair will carefully 
consider any such offer, should one be received, from IAG or any other party, in due course," it said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum has reiterated its Buy rating for Ryanair, after the Irish airline's results came in 
a touch ahead of its forecasts. 
Ryanair reported a rise in revenue to EUR1.13 billion in the three months to December 31 from EUR964 million a 
year earlier. The number came in ahead of Liberum's EUR1.11 billion forecast. The company's net profit of EUR49 
million also outstripped Liberum's estimate of EUR38 million.
However, Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo notes that management referred to its profit growth expectations for 2016 to 
be modest. "We suspect this is an attempt to keep a lid on fuel-driven upgrades," the analyst says. 
Khoo adds that while Ryanair trades at a deserved clear premium to the rest of the European airlines sector, there 
is limited scope for significant re-rating from here, and management's caution may restrain earnings upgrades. 
Liberum has a EUR10.50 price target. 
Cantor Fitzgerald also reiterates its Buy rating on Ryanair, saying that the company beat its expectations. However, 
Cantor analyst Robin Byde sees scope for small upgrades to consensus for financial years 2015-17 after 
management raised its full-year guidance for financial year 2015.
Cantor places its price target under review from EUR10.  
Ryanair currently trades down 2.5% at EUR10.14.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish companies are making the corporate headlines Monday, with building materials 
company CRH snapping up assets being divested as part of the merger of rivals Holcim and Lafarge, and Ryanair 
Holdings raising guidance for the current financial year for a fourth time but urging investors and analysts to be 
cautious about its next fiscal year.
CRH will pay EUR6.5 billion to buy assets from Holcim and Lafarge, primarily in Europe, Canada, Brazil and the 
Philippines. It will use EUR2.0 billion of cash from its balance sheet, new bank debt, and the proceeds of a share 
placing to fund the deal, which it expects to result in EUR90 million of synergies by year three after completion. It 
also expects the deal to boost earnings per share by about 25% in the first full year of ownership of the assets.
CRH said it expects the assets to report earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of EUR752 
million in 2014, as it confirmed its own Ebitda guidance for the year at no less that EUR1.63 billion excluding those 
assets.
The Irish building materials company, which expects the deal to make it the third-largest building materials company 
in the world, said its pro-forma net debt to Ebitda cover is expected to be 3.2 times, which it said it will reduce by 
disposals of assets in the wake of the portfolio review it previously announced.
Ryanair, meanwhile, announced a EUR400 million share buyback, as it raised its full-year guidance on the back of 
falling fuel prices and said it swung to a profit in the third quarter of the financial year compared with a loss a year 
earlier.
However, its shares fell as it urged shareholders and analysts to temper their expectations for its next financial year, 
fiscal 2016. It said it expects profit growth next year to be modest, and said it expects fares to come under pressure 
because some rivals who haven't hedged forward fuel needs will benefit from the full impact of the recent oil price 
declines and will lower fares.
UK MIDDAY BRIEFING: CRH Expands, Buoyant Ryanair Urges Caution
Europe's low-cost carrier said it had already noticed some softening in prices on forward bookings during the first 
few weeks of January, but it is now expecting a 5% decline in unit costs for the financial year as a whole. It is 
therefore raising its net profit guidance for the year to end-March to between EUR840 million and EUR850 million, 
from its previous guidance of between EUR810 million and EUR830 million.
Ryanair said it will start a EUR400 million share buyback on February 12 which will last for six months, a move that 
reflects its improved profitability and cash flow. That's on top of the EUR520 million, or EUR0.375 a share, special 
dividend that it had previously announced and that it will pay on February 27.
The airline reported a EUR49 million profit for the three months to December 31, its fiscal third quarter, compared 
with a loss of EUR35 million a year earlier. Revenue rose to EUR1.13 billion, from EUR964 million, as passenger 
numbers rose to 20.8 million, from 18.3 million. Basic earnings per share were 3.53 euro cents, compared with a 
loss of 2.50 cents.
Ryanair shares are down 4.6%, and the cautious outlook is also weighing on FTSE 100-listed easyJet, down 4.7%.
Ryanair declined to comment further on International Consolidated Airline Group's attempt to acquire Irish flag 
carrier Aer Lingus, in which Ryanair is the biggest shareholder.
"Since Ryanair has received no formal approach, or offer for our shares in Aer Lingus, we will not engage in any 
speculation about this proposal, other than to restate our position which is that the Board of Ryanair will carefully 
consider any such offer, should one be received, from IAG or any other party, in due course," it said.

reaching USD1.5089, but fell sharply shortly thereafter.

Africa to the Falkland Islands for the 2015 drilling programme. Ascent Resources has lost more than a quarter of its

notes when they fell due. ISG is also a big faller after it warned about its full-year results, saying problems with a

Top Economics And General
----------
UK manufacturing sector growth remained strong in January, data from Markit Economics showed. The 
Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53 in January from a 
revised score of 52.7 in December. The score also exceeded the expected level of 52.8. The index has remained 
above the neutral 50 mark in each month since April 2013. Manufacturing output expanded for the twenty-third 
consecutive month underpinned by a further increase in incoming new orders.
----------
Eurozone's manufacturing activity grew at a faster rate in January, confirming the flash estimate, final figures from 
Markit Economics showed. The final Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 51 in 
January from 50.6 in December. This was unrevised from the flash estimate. Production increased at the fastest 
rate in six months. New orders rose marginally in January. Employment levels rose for the fifth successive month 
and the rate of job creation was unchanged from the eight-month high in December.
----------
UK MIDDAY BRIEFING: CRH Expands, Buoyant Ryanair Urges Caution
Ireland's manufacturing sector continued to expand at a solid pace in January, though at the slowest rate since 
May. The seasonally adjusted Investec purchasing managers' index, or PMI, fell to 55.1 in January from 56.9 in 
December. This marked the slowest pace of expansion in eight months and the twentieth consecutive month of 
increase.
----------
The Chinese manufacturing sector contracted slightly more than the initially estimated in January, although the 
contraction slowed from the previous month, the results of the latest survey from HSBC revealed. Revised 
estimates based on the final survey showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers' index, or PMI, came in at 
49.7 in January, slightly less than the flash estimate of 49.8. However, the score was marginally more than the 49.6 
reading in December. This marked the second consecutive month of contraction. A reading above 50 signals 
expansion in activity while that below 50 indicates contraction.
----------
Japan's manufacturing sector continued to expand at a steady pace in January, the latest survey from Markit 
Economics showed. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index edged up to 52.2 in January from 50 in 
February. It marked the eight consecutive month of expansion.
----------
Greece's finance minister kicked off a European roadshow in Paris on Sunday as the country's newly elected prime 
minister showed willingness to negotiate on Greek debt repayment ahead of talks with EU Commission President 
Jean-Claude Juncker. A telephone conversation between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Juncker went 
smoothly on Saturday, sources close to the commission president said. The two agreed to hold face-to-face talks 
on Wednesday, when Tsipras will also meet French President Francois Hollande in Paris.
----------
Constitutional Court Judge Sergio Mattarella was elected as Italy's new head of state, sealing a presidential election 
that was expertly steered by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to the detriment of opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi. 
The incoming president, 73, is a former Christian Democrat minister from Sicily, active in politics from 1983 to 2008, 
who was promoted to the top court in 2011. He has a reputation for moral integrity and solid anti-Mafia credentials 
but little international recognition.
----------
The top leader of the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine announced an all-out mobilisation and claimed that 
100,000 fighters would be recruited. Alexander Zakharchenko's call came after another effort to set up peace talks 
to resolve the conflict foundered over the weekend. "In 10 days, we will begin a general mobilization," 
Zakharchenko said, according to the semi-official Donetsk News Agency. "We plan to mobilize up to 100,000 
people."
----------
Iraqi Kurdish troops retook a major oilfield from the Islamic State on Saturday, almost a day after the militant group 
seized it, an Iraqi security official said. The troops, backed by allied warplanes, launched an attack and drove the 
jihadists out of the Khbaz oil complex west of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, Brigadier Sarhad Qader, a senior police 
officer in Kirkuk, told dpa. He said that around 40 militants were killed in the operation and two armoured vehicles 
belonging to Islamic State were seized. On Friday, Islamic State fighters overran the complex and held 24 of its 
employees hostage.
----------
Japan will stand firm in its support for international anti-terrorism operations, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, after 
the Islamic State posted a video at the weekend showing the beheading of a second Japanese hostage. "Japan will 
never yield to terrorists. We will ensure the safety of Japanese nationals with a unified effort," Abe told a meeting of 
lawmakers from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and coalition allies the New Komeito Party.

PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets were trading mostly higher on Monday afternoon, after Eurozone's 
manufacturing activity grew at a faster rate in January, confirming the flash estimate.
Final figures from Markit Economics revealed that the final Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index 
rose to 51 in January from 50.6 in December.
The German manufacturing sector expanded at a slower than expected rate in January while the French 
manufacturing activity contracted at a slightly faster than expected pace though the rate of contraction was slowest 
in eight months.
Meanwhile, the UK manufacturing sector growth remained strong in January, data from Markit Economics showed. 
The Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53 in January from a 
revised score of 52.7 in December. The score also exceeded the expected level of 52.8.
The Chinese manufacturing sector contracted slightly more than the initially estimated in January, although the 
contraction slowed from the previous month. The results of the latest survey from HSBC revealed that the 
manufacturing PMI came in at 49.7 in January, slightly less than the flash estimate of 49.8. However, the score was 
marginally more than the 49.6 reading in December.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks was losing 0.55%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, was falling 0.70%.
The German DAX, the FTSE 100 index of the UK and Switzerland's SMI were in the green, while the French CAC 
40 was languishing in negative territory.
In Frankfurt, K+S gained 1.7% and Henkel added 1.3%.
MunichRe and Continental were gaining 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively.
European Markets Mostly Higher, Ryanair Drops
Meanwhile, Lufthansa fell 2.7%, and Infineon Technologies dropped 1.1%.
Commerzbank was 1.6% lower, while Deutsche Bank dropped around 1%.
In Paris, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale lost between 1.9% and 1.4%.
Vallourec and Carrefour added 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively.
Total and Technip were up 2.4% and 1.4%, in that order.
Lafarge was moderately higher after the cement giant and Swiss peer Holcim announced sales of certain assets to 
Ireland-based CRH in order to facilitate their merger. Holcim gained over 2% in Zurich.
In London, CRH climbed close to 5%. Oil firms BG Group and Tullow Oil were gaining around 4.2% each.
Ryanair lost around 5%. The low-cost airline said that for fiscal 2016, it expects a modest profit growth.
The Asian stocks ended mixed as weaker-than-expected US GDP data and disappointing reports on China's 
manufacturing sector sapped investors' appetite for risk. Australian shares extended gains for an eighth straight 
session as hopes for rate cuts outweighed global growth concerns.
In the US, futures point to a lower open on Wall Street. In the previous session, stocks ended firmly in the red, with 
the Dow Jones industrial Average and the S&P 500 falling over a percent each to post their biggest monthly losses 
in a year.
Crude for March delivery fell USD0.53 to USD47.71 per barrel, while April gold fell USD4.2 to USD1275.0 a troy 
ounce.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets may follow Asian stocks lower on Monday as a couple of reports 
underscored the inherent weakness of the world's second-largest economy.
China's factory activity sector shrank for the first time in more than two years in January, an official report showed, 
adding to pressure on the government to unveil more measures to boost growth. The official Purchasing Managers' 
Index (PMI) fell to 49.8, marking its second consecutive monthly decline and surprising economists who were 
expecting an expansion. The final HSBC PMI also fell to 49.7, slightly lower than a preliminary flash reading of 49.8.
While Chinese shares led losses in the Asia-Pacific region, the Australian market extended gains for an eighth day 
on expectations the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates at its policy meeting tomorrow.
Looking ahead, investors eye a slew of US reports on personal income and spending, manufacturing and service 
sector activity and private sector employment this week ahead of the all-important monthly jobs report due on 
Friday. Manufacturing PMI data of Germany and UK are slated for release in the European session.
The safe-haven Japanese yen remains little changed while the Russian ruble continues to fall after its central bank 
on Friday cut its key interest rate to support a deteriorating economy. Oil prices fell in Asian deals, cutting some of 
the strong gains made on Friday in the wake of data showing a sharp drop in US drilling.
In news out of Ukraine, at least 13 Ukrainian soldiers have reportedly been killed and 20 others wounded since 
peace talks with pro-Russian rebels collapsed on Saturday. US Secretary of State John Kerry plans to visit Kiev on 
Thursday as part of efforts to initiate fresh talks over sending lethal aid to Ukraine's beleaguered troops.
In domestic corporate news, Shire PLC announced that the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the 
extended use of its blockbuster drug Vyvanse to treat binge-eating disorder in adults.
Irish building materials company CRH PLC has agreed to acquire assets from cement companies Lafarge SA and 
Holcim for 6.5 billion euros.
European Stocks Seen Subdued After China Data
Swiss private banking group Julius Baer Group reported a 96% jump in its full year IFRS net profit to 367 million 
Swiss francs.
Ryanair, Europe's low fares airline, reported third-quarter net profit of 49 million euros compared to a loss of 35 
million euros last year.
European stocks fell on Friday, with weak US GDP and Eurozone inflation data weighing on the markets. Investors 
also kept a keen eye over developments in Greece after Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem warned Athens 
against taking unilateral steps and ignoring previous arrangements. The German DAX dropped 0.4%, France's 
CAC 40 shed 0.6% and the UK's FTSE 100 fell 0.9%.
US stocks also ended firmly in the red Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial Average and the S&P 500 falling over a 
percent each to post their biggest monthly losses in a year, as investors weighed the consequences of a weaker-
than-expected GDP reading and a strengthening dollar on corporate earnings. Meanwhile, traders largely shrugged 
off separate reports showing consumer sentiment at an eleven-year high and acceleration in the pace of growth in 
Chicago business activity.
The Commerce Department said US GDP grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter, down from 5% in the third quarter and 
4.6% in the second quarter. Economists had expected GDP to increase by about 3.2%.

At least 20 people were killed and 40 others injured in eastern Ukraine in the 24 hours since peace talks between 
Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Minsk stalled, the military and separatist leaders said. Military spokesman 
Vladimir Polevoi said that 13 soldiers were killed and 20 other military personnel injured, while separatist leaders 
said that seven civilians had been killed and at least 20 injured in the restive eastern regions of Donetsk and 
Luhansk. The news comes after pro-Russian separatist envoys present at talks in Minsk effectively blocked the 
negotiations and sought to revise a previous ceasefire deal, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe (OSCE) said.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK manufacturing sector growth remained strong in January, data from Markit Economics showed. The 
Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53 in January from a 
revised score of 52.7 in December. The score also exceeded the expected level of 52.8. The index has remained 
above the neutral 50 mark in each month since April 2013. Manufacturing output expanded for the twenty-third 
consecutive month underpinned by a further increase in incoming new orders.
----------
Eurozone's manufacturing activity grew at a faster rate in January, confirming the flash estimate, final figures from 
Markit Economics showed. The final Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 51 in 
January from 50.6 in December. This was unrevised from the flash estimate. Production increased at the fastest 
rate in six months. New orders rose marginally in January. Employment levels rose for the fifth successive month 
and the rate of job creation was unchanged from the eight-month high in December.
----------
Ireland's manufacturing sector continued to expand at a solid pace in January, though at the slowest rate since 
May. The seasonally adjusted Investec purchasing managers' index, or PMI, fell to 55.1 in January from 56.9 in 
December. This marked the slowest pace of expansion in eight months and the twentieth consecutive month of 
increase.
----------
The Chinese manufacturing sector contracted slightly more than the initially estimated in January, although the 
contraction slowed from the previous month, the results of the latest survey from HSBC revealed. Revised 
estimates based on the final survey showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers' index, or PMI, came in at 
49.7 in January, slightly less than the flash estimate of 49.8. However, the score was marginally more than the 49.6 
reading in December. This marked the second consecutive month of contraction. A reading above 50 signals 
expansion in activity while that below 50 indicates contraction.
----------
Japan's manufacturing sector continued to expand at a steady pace in January, the latest survey from Markit 
Economics showed. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index edged up to 52.2 in January from 50 in 
February. It marked the eight consecutive month of expansion.
----------
Greece's finance minister kicked off a European roadshow in Paris on Sunday as the country's newly elected prime 
minister showed willingness to negotiate on Greek debt repayment ahead of talks with EU Commission President 
Jean-Claude Juncker. A telephone conversation between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Juncker went 
smoothly on Saturday, sources close to the commission president said. The two agreed to hold face-to-face talks 
on Wednesday, when Tsipras will also meet French President Francois Hollande in Paris.
----------
Constitutional Court Judge Sergio Mattarella was elected as Italy's new head of state, sealing a presidential election 
that was expertly steered by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to the detriment of opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi. 
The incoming president, 73, is a former Christian Democrat minister from Sicily, active in politics from 1983 to 2008, 
who was promoted to the top court in 2011. He has a reputation for moral integrity and solid anti-Mafia credentials 
but little international recognition.
----------
The top leader of the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine announced an all-out mobilisation and claimed that 
100,000 fighters would be recruited. Alexander Zakharchenko's call came after another effort to set up peace talks 
to resolve the conflict foundered over the weekend. "In 10 days, we will begin a general mobilization," 
Zakharchenko said, according to the semi-official Donetsk News Agency. "We plan to mobilize up to 100,000 
people."

In London, Ryanair dropped by 6.01%. The low-cost airline said that for fiscal 2016, it expects a modest profit 
growth.
CRH climbed by 7.17%, after announcing the purchase of certain assets from Lafarge and Holcim.
Tullow Oil surged by 9.32% and BG Group added 5.33%. BP rose by 3.12% and Royal Dutch Shell gained 2.53%.
Julius Baer surged by 8.62% in Zurich. The company announced a cost cutting program, to offset the surge in the 
Swiss franc.
The Chinese manufacturing sector contracted slightly more than the initially estimated in January, although the 
contraction slowed from the previous month, the results of the latest survey from HSBC revealed Monday.
Revised estimates based on the final survey showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers' index, or PMI, 
came in at 49.7 in January, slightly less than the flash estimate of 49.8. However, the score was marginally more 
than the 49.6 reading in December. This marked the second consecutive month of contraction.
Personal income in the US rose by slightly more than anticipated in the month of December, according to a report 
released by the Commerce Department on Monday, although the report also showed a slightly bigger than 
expected drop in personal spending.
The report said personal income rose by 0.3% in December, matching the downwardly revised increase seen in 
November. Economists had expected income to inch up by 0.2% compared to the 0.4% growth originally reported 
for the previous month.
Meanwhile, the report said personal spending dipped by 0.3% in December after climbing by a downwardly revised 
0.5% in November. Spending had been expected to edge down by 0.2% compared to the 0.6% increase originally 
reported for the previous month.
Partly reflecting problems caused by a West Coast dock slowdown, the Institute for Supply Management released a 
report on Monday showing that US manufacturing activity grew at a slower than expected pace in the month of 
January.
The ISM said its purchasing managers index fell to 53.5 in January from 55.1 in December. While a reading above 
50 indicates continued growth in the manufacturing sector, economists had expected the index to show a more 
modest drop to 54.5.
While the Commerce Department released a report on Monday showing a rebound by US construction spending in 
the month of December, the pace of spending growth fell short of economist estimates. The report said construction 
spending climbed 0.4% to an annual rate of USD982.1 billion in December after falling 0.2% to a rate of USD978.6 
billion in November.
Economists had been expecting construction spending to increase by about 0.6% compared to the 0.3% drop 
originally reported for the previous month.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group SA Friday said state-owned Qatar Airways 
has acquired a 9.99% stake in the company, a move that strengthens and formalises the ties between the two 
carriers and continues the recent consolidation in the sector.
No financial details were given on the acquisition of the stake, but based on IAG's closing share price on Thursday 
of 564.00 pence a share, the stake would be worth nearly GBP1.2 billion. IAG's shares were up 0.2% to 565.00 
pence Friday morning. 
Middle East airlines like Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways have grown quickly over the last decade, 
creating increased competition for the large European carriers particularly on Asian and Middle East routes. The 
response of European airline groups like IAG and Air France-KLM has been to forge closer ties with their new 
competitors. Air France-KLM has a commercial partnership with Etihad.
Qatar Airways is in the Oneworld alliance that also includes IAG airlines British Airways and Iberia. IAG already has 
close commercial ties with another Oneworld alliance member, American Airlines Group Inc, running a transatlantic 
joint venture with the US carrier that allows them to closely coordinate on schedules and prices.
“IAG represents an excellent opportunity to further develop our Westwards strategy. Having joined the oneworld 
alliance it makes sense for us to work more closely together in the near term and we look forward to forging a long-
term relationship,” Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said in a statement.
Qatar Airways said it may consider increasing its stake in IAG over time, but does not currently intend it to exceed 
the 9.99% level. It is bound by European Union airline ownership rules that state EU airlines must be majority 
owned by EU shareholders. Overall non-EU ownership of any EU airline is therefore capped. IAG's other major 
shareholders currently include US-based Capital Research and Management Company and Franklin Resources 
Inc.
UPDATE: Qatar Airways Becomes IAG 's Biggest Shareholder
The Qatar Airways stake buy also comes at a time when IAG, which also owns Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling, is 
trying to acquire Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus PLC, a deal that needs to be agreed by major Aer Lingus shareholders 
Ryanair Holdings PLC and the Irish government.
"We're delighted to have Qatar Airways, one of the world's premier airlines, as a long term supportive shareholder. 
We will talk to them about what opportunities exist to work more closely together and further IAG's ambitions as the 
leading global airline group," said IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh in a statement.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Aer Lingus PLC Tuesday said its board has indicated to International Consolidated 
Airlines Group PLC that it would be willing to recommend the British Airways owners' EUR1.36 billion bid for the 
Irish airline.
IAG, which also owns Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling, raised its bid for Aer Lingus for a second time on 
Monday, and is now offering EUR2.55 a share in cash in total. That figure includes a cash dividend of EUR0.05 a 
share. 
"Having considered this request, the board has indicated to IAG that the financial terms are at a level at which it 
would be willing to recommend, subject to being satisfied with the manner in which IAG proposes to address the 
interests of relevant parties," Aer Lingus said in a statement.
In a separate statement, IAG said it has now been granted access to allow it to perform a limited period of due 
diligence.
The deal will need to be accepted by the Irish carrier's two biggest shareholders, Ryanair Holdings PLC and the 
Irish government. Both parties have said they will carefully considered the proposed deal.
The Irish Times reported Tuesday that the Irish government is unlikely to make its views known before it knows the 
views of antitrust regulators in Brussels. Those regulators have previously blocked Ryanair's attempts to acquire 
Aer Lingus.
"IAG recognises the importance of direct air services and air route connectivity for investment and tourism in Ireland 
and intends to engage with the Irish Government in order to secure its support for the transaction," the airline group 
said in its statement.

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Irish airline Aer Lingus Group PLC's board is set to recommend its shareholders to 
accept a revised proposal from International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, according to media reports.
Earlier today, Aer Lingus Group confirmed that it received a revised proposal from International Consolidated 
Airlines Group, and that its board is considering the new offer.
The revised offer values each Aer Lingus share at 2.55 euros, comprising an all cash offer for the company of 2.50 
euros per share and a cash dividend of 0.05 euro per share.
Dublin-based Aer Lingus received a preliminary, highly conditional and non-binding 2.30 euros per share offer from 
IAG on December 14, 2014. The airline rejected the offer on December 18, saying it fundamentally undervalued Aer 
Lingus and its attractive prospects.
IAG approached Aer Lingus again during the month, which was also rejected by the Irish airline. That sweetened 
proposal consisted of a cash offer of 2.40 euros per Aer Lingus share, subject to certain pre-conditions.
A bid to buy Aer Lingus needs the approval of the Irish government, which has about 25% stake in the airline, and 
also of Ryanair, which has a near 30% stake and had made unsuccessful offers to acquire Aer Lingus.

LONDON (Alliance News) - London markets set to open in positive territory for a ninth session Tuesday, as 
investors shift focus to UK economic output later in the morning and give a backseat to concerns over the situation 
in Greece.
The FTSE 100 is called to open 4 points higher at 6,856.3, up from Monday's 6,852.4 close, which saw the index 
rise 0.3%.
"European markets put to one side concerns about the politics to continue to build on last week’s gains, after 
German business sentiment improved for the third month in a row," says Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK. 
"The main focus away from Greece is back on the UK with the initial assessment of the UK economy’s economic 
performance for the fourth quarter."
Expectations are for gross domestic product to come in at around 0.6%, hindered somewhat by the slowdown seen 
in the construction and manufacturing sectors, Hewson adds. The report is due at 0930 GMT.
The French CAC 40 closed up 0.7% on Monday, and the DAX 30 up 1.4% at 10,798.33, continuing its run of record 
highs. The German index was boosted by a positive IFO business sentiment index reading of 106.7 in January, 
slightly more than the 106.4 score expected by economists. In December, the index was at 105.5.
US durable goods orders for December are due Tuesday at 1330 GMT and US consumer confidence for January is 
expected at 1500 GMT.
"The December durable goods release will provide one of the final key reports ahead of the fourth-quarter GDP 
print on Friday," says Lloyds Bank. "Following November’s 0.9% decline, orders are expected to have stabilised last 
month and we forecast a 0.9% rise." US GDP numbers are due at 1330 GMT on Friday.
MARKET COMMENT: London Stocks Forecast To Open Higher Ahead Of UK GDP
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed up 1.7% at 17,768.3.52 Tuesday, buoyed by a weaker yen. The Hang Seng in Hong 
Kong is down 0.6% at 24,766.37 and the Shanghai Composite is 0.9% lower at 3,352.96.
Brent crude is quoted at around USD48.05 a barrel Tuesday, and US benchmark West Texas Intermediate is 
quoted at USD45.05 a barrel. Gold is steady at just under the psychologically important USD1,300 level, quoted 
early Tuesday at USD1,282.97 an ounce.
In UK corporate news, the board of Irish carrier Aer Lingus said it will give its recommendation to a EUR1.36 billion 
takeover offer from International Consolidated Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia and 
Vueling. IAG also needs the support of shareholders Ryanair and the Irish Minister for Finance.
Low-cost carrier easyJet said first-quarter revenue rose to GBP931 million as passenger numbers increased to 14.9 
million from 14.3 million a year earlier. It forecast a pretax loss between GBP10 million and GBP30 million in the 
seasonally slow first half of the year and said it still expects to grow capacity, measured in seats flown, by around 
3.5% in the first half of the year and by around 5% for the full year. 
Soft drinks maker Britvic said revenue fell 0.4% to GBP304.3 million and volumes fell 0.3% in the 12 weeks to 
December 21, reflecting challenging trading conditions in its main markets. Still, the company said it remains 
confident of delivering earnings before interest and taxes of between GBP164 million and GBP173 million, 
underpinned by cost savings.
US earnings later on Tuesday include DJIA constituents 3M, AT&T, Caterpillar, DuPont, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble 
and United Technologies, as well as Apple, American Airlines and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

LONDON (Alliance News) - EasyJet is one of the best performing stocks in the FTSE 100 so far Tuesday, after the 
low-cost airline said it expects to report a smaller first-half loss in its current financial year as first-quarter revenue 
rose on the back of strong demand from business and leisure travellers.
The airline said it expects to report a pretax loss of between GBP10 million and GBP30 million in the first half of its 
financial year, narrower than the GBP53 million loss it reported in the first half of last year.
The airline said revenue in the first quarter to end-December rose GBP34 million on the year to GBP931 million, as 
revenue per seat grew 0.8% to GBP56.16. The per seat revenue increase was 3.7% at constant currencies.
The airline flew 14.9 million passengers in the quarter, up 4.1% on the year, while it increased capacity by 2.9% to 
16.6 million seats flown. Therefore its load factor rose 1.0 percentage point to 89.7%.
"We enjoyed a strong October across the network - particularly on UK leisure flights to beach destinations and on 
French domestic routes where we continued to build passenger numbers after a busy September," Chief Executive 
Carolyn McCall said.
"We further strengthened our network in the quarter adding around 500,000 seats, the majority of which are from 
airports where easyJet has a number one or number two position. This combined with our new TV ads aimed at 
business travellers enabled easyJet to sell record numbers of seats to business travellers in the first quarter," she 
added.
International Consolidated Airlines Group shares are also higher, after the board of takeover target Aer LIngus said 
it had indicated that it would be willing to recommend the British Airways owners' EUR1.36 billion bid for the Irish 
airline.

three years, reflecting its strong cash generation. The house builder reported a pretax profit of GBP116.7 million for 
the year to end-October, up from GBP80.9 million a year earlier, as revenue rose to GBP636.3 million, from 
GBP525.7 million.

power generation rising significantly in the final nine months of 2015. Gamma Communications is up after it said 
revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, exceptional costs and share-based payments 
for 2014 are to be slightly ahead of its original expectations. Nyota Minerals has lost a third of its value after it said 
its Towchester Investment Company Ltd subsidiary hadn't been granted a mining license for alluvial gold mining on 
the Abay River in Ethiopia and it won't be appealing the decision. Volga Gas shares are down by a quarter after it 
took itself off the auction block after failing to attract any acceptable offers, and said it expects its costs to come 
down in line with a decline in revenue. Benchmark Holdings is down after it swung to a loss in its last financial year 
as it ramped up headcount to help drive future growth and invested heavily in research and development and 
manufacturing, although sales grew strongly.

Top Economics And General
----------
The UK economy grew at a slower pace in the fourth quarter, preliminary estimates from the Office for National 
Statistics showed. Gross domestic product grew 0.5% sequentially, slower than the 0.7% expansion seen in the 
third quarter and a 0.6% rise forecast by economists. Output increased by 0.8% in services and 1.3% in agriculture. 
In contrast, output decreased by 1.8% in construction and 0.1% in production. GDP grew 2.7% in the fourth quarter 
compared with the same quarter a year ago, which was slightly slower than the expected growth of 2.8%. In 2014, 
GDP was up 2.6%.
----------
UK mortgage approvals decreased more than expected in December, data from British Bankers' Association, or 
BBA, revealed. The number of loans approved for house purchases fell to 35,667 in December from 36,657 in 
November. It was forecast to fall to 36,500. After the temporary bottleneck associated with the implementation of 
the Mortgage Market Review in early 2014, overall approval numbers have been slowing through the rest of the 
year, the BBA said. However, the number of home mortgage approvals rose to 499,000 in 2014 from 459,000 in 
2013.
----------
Leftist leader Alex Tsipras was sworn in as Greece's new prime minister on Monday, hours after clinching a deal 
with the right-wing Independent Greeks to form an anti-austerity government. President Karolous Papoulias 
administered the oath in a ceremony at the presidential palace in Athens, shorting after giving Tsipras the mandate 
to form a government. "I will always look after the best interests of the country," Tsipras told Papoulias. It was a 
departure from tradition, as the prime minister-designate is usually sworn in by the head of the Greek Orthodox 
Church. Tsipras is an atheist.
----------
The eurogroup is ready to work with the new Greek government, but there is very little support for a writedown of 
debt, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup said late Monday. Pointing out that a number of concessions 
have already been made to Greece, Dijsselbloem said, "Working within the Eurozone means they will comply with 
all the rules and agreements that we have within the Eurozone, and on that basis, we will support them where we 
can." He said that the eurozone has supported Greece by reducing interest rates and by allowing longer repayment 
periods.
----------
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services downgraded Russia's sovereign credit rating to below investment grade for the 
first time in more than a decade. S&P cut Russia's sovereign credit rating to "BB+" from "BBB-". The rating outlook 
is negative. Last month, S&P placed Russia on negative watch, citing the rapid deterioration of its monetary 
flexibility and the impact of the weakening economy on the country's financial system. Earlier this month, Fitch 
Ratings downgraded Russia to its lowest investment grade, followed by Moody's Investors Service.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish airline Aer Lingus Group PLC Monday confirmed that it has received a revised

the offer.  
It is the second time that IAG has raised its offer for the Irish flag carrier, whose major shareholders include the Irish 
government and Ryanair Holdings PLC. The parent of British Airways and Spain's Iberia originally offered EUR2.30 
a share, and then raised its offer to EUR2.40 a share.
The latest offer comprises a EUR2.50 a share cash offer for Aer Lingus shares and a cash dividend of EUR0.05 a 
share. In total, the offer values Aer Lingus at EUR1.36 billion, according to an Alliance News calculation.
Aer Lingus is not an easy takeover target due to its shareholding. Ryanair has made several attempts to acquire its 
Irish rival, but has been thwarted by its shareholders and regulators. It built up a 29% stake in Aer Lingus during its 
acquisition attempts, and has signaled that it may support a takeover of Aer Lingus by IAG.
Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, said recently that Ryanair has not held talks with IAG but held no 
particular concerns about the company taking control of the Irish flag carrier.
The Irish Times reported on Sunday that the Irish government will consider IAG's takeover bid for the country's 
national carrier. Transport Minister Paschal Donohoe was reported as saying the government would assess the 
value of the offer and any impact of the sale on Ireland's links to the rest of the world. The Irish government has a 
25.1% stake in Aer Lingus.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Cantor Fitzgerald says International Consolidated Airlines Group's latest approach to 
buy Aer Lingus is attractive, calling the Irish airline a "strongly performing but nonetheless sub-scale operator", but 
says politics could complicate the deal.
Aer Lingus confirmed that IAG, owner of British Airways, has made a further offer for the company at EUR2.55 a 
share, comprising EUR2.50 in cash and a dividend of EUR0.05, conditional on the recommendation of the Aer 
Lingus board and acceptance from shareholders Ryanair and the Irish Minister for Finance. In total, the offer values 
Aer Lingus at EUR1.36 billion, according to an Alliance News calculation.
Cantor says IAG is seeking to build on Aer Lingus’s lucrative niche on transatlantic routes, which offers customs 
and immigration clearance in Dublin and Shannon for flights to the US. The other main attraction is the carrier’s 23 
slot pairs at Heathrow, which the broker calculates are valued at around EUR10 million a pair.
Cantor expects near-30% shareholder Ryanair will accept this offer as it is under on-going pressure from UK 
competition authorities to sell, noting the airline has written down its holding and its average purchase price was 
EUR2.56. The Irish government also owns 25.1% after Aer Lingus was floated in 2006 at EUR2.60, but Cantor says 
that the disposal of that stake is more problematic. 
"Concerns have already been raised by opposition politicians from Fiánna Fail, about the potential impact on 
Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports," Cantor says. "We also understand that the Impact trade union – which 
represents cabin crew, pilots and some ground staff at Aer Lingus - has raised concerns about job losses."
Cantor remains concerned about the politics of the deal and the potential for IAG to get dragged into prolonged and 
distracting negotiations, but nonetheless reiterates its Hold recommendation for IAG while placing its 470 pence 
price target on the stock under review.
In morning trade, IAG shares are the best performing stock in the FTSE 100, up 3.2% at 553.12p. Aer Lingus 
shares are up 1.5% at EUR2.388.

London (Alliance News) - Shares in takeover target Aer Lingus rose Monday ahead of a crucial Dublin meeting to 
discuss a sweetened offer for Ireland's national airline from International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company 
of British Airways.
The share price rose 1.3% after IAG put in a cash offer of 2.55 euros (2.87 dollars) a share, trumping its previously 
rejected offers of 2.30 euros and 2.40 euros.
The offer is to be discussed at the Irish cabinet's weekly meeting in Dublin on Tuesday.
At the weekend, Irish Transport Minister Paschal Donohoe was reported as saying the cabinet would assess not 
just the valuation of the airline, but the implications for Ireland's links to the rest of the world if the government lost 
control.
The Irish government has a 25.1% stake in Aer Lingus. Budget carrier Ryanair, a previous Aer Lingus suitor, has a 
29.8% stake.
The BBC speculated that IAG boss Willie Walsh, a former Aer Lingus chief, covets the airline's take-off and landing 
slots at London's Heathrow airport, where Aer Lingus is the fourth-largest operator after British Airways, Lufthansa 
and Virgin Atlantic.
His latest offer for Aer Lingus values the airline at around 1.3 billion euros.
Walsh was the driving force behind the deal that saw Spain's Iberia folded into IAG three years ago, a splicing that 
was aimed at cutting costs to ward off encroachments from Etihad, Emirates and other Middle East rivals that 
operate big hub airports.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group has raised its offer for Aer Lingus Group a 
second time, saying Monday it is now offering EUR2.55 a share in cash, which values the Irish flag carrier at 
EUR1.36 billion. 
The parent of British Airways and Spain's Iberia originally offered EUR2.30 a share, and then raised its offer to 
EUR2.40 a share. The latest offer comprises a EUR2.50 a share cash offer for Aer Lingus shares and a cash 
dividend of EUR0.05 a share. Aer Lingus says its board is considering the new offer.
Aer Lingus is not an easy takeover target due to its shareholder base. Ryanair has made several attempts to

NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc has had its Natpara drug for hypoparathyroidism approved by the US Food and Drug

The US FDA has approved Natpara as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with 
hypoparathyroidism, which is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone.

SSE kept its lowered guidance for its results in the current financial year, and said it still expects to pay a dividend 
for the year that's at least equal to RPI inflation, continuing that policy in future years as well. The gas and electricity 
generator said it still expects its results for the year to March 31 to be in line with the guidance it gave when it put 
out its half-year results last November. At that time, it had said adjusted earnings per share would be towards the 
lower end of a guidance range it had given in March, and roughly the same level as it had achieved in its last 
financial year.

Management have in recent weeks separately told the emerging markets bank that a successor to Sands must be

Greece's leftist Syriza party struck a deal with a small right-wing populist party to form a government, after narrowly 
failing to win an outright majority in parliamentary elections. "From this moment, I want to announce that we have a 
government," Independent Greeks party leader Panos Kammenos said. "The Independent Greeks give a vote of 
confidence to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras," he said. "The prime minister will go to the president later today so that 
he can receive the mandate to form a government," Kammenos added, after leaving a meeting in Athens with the 
Syriza's leader.

Bank of England policymaker Kristin Forbes said that UK interest rates may need to be raised earlier than many 
expect as falling oil prices could boost consumption and investment. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, 
Forbes said robust growth in the US and cheaper oil could benefit consumption and investment growth, which will 
strengthen the case for raising the interest rate from a record low 0.50%, earlier than expected. The UK central 
bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by the middle of 2016. The central bank targets inflation of 2%. 
Headline inflation eased to 0.5% in December.
----------
Majority of Bank of Japan's policymakers said that the drop in oil prices will affect the economy and inflation 
positively in the long-term, though it is expected to weigh on inflation in the short-term, the minutes of the meeting 
held on December 18 and 19 showed. However, one member said that the primary focus should be on the 
underlying trend in prices when considering the future conduct of monetary policy, and that the key was 
developments in inflation expectations in a broad context, the minutes said.
----------
Japan's trade deficit decreased more than expected in December, figures from the Ministry of Finance showed. The 
trade deficit came in at JPY660.7 billion in December, less than the JPY735.2 billion expected by economists. In 
November, the deficit was at JPY893.5 billion. In the same month of the previous year, the deficit was at JPY1.307

trillion. Exports rose 12.9% year-over-year following the 4.9% in the previous month. This was more than the 11.2% 
consensus estimate. Imports rebounded by 1.9% after the 1.6% drop in November, slightly less than the 2% 
increase expected by economists.
----------
The Islamic State jihadist group claimed responsibility in an internet radio broadcast for the beheading of a 
Japanese hostage. "The Japanese hostage was executed after the expiration of a deadline that had been reported 
to Japan," an Islamic State spokesman said on the militant jihadist group's al-Bayan internet radio service. An 
internet video released Saturday contained an image of what appeared to be the lifeless remains of Haruna 
Yakawa, 42. Sunday's internet message was the first confirmation by an Islamic State source. The group continues 
to hold a second Japanese hostage, Kenji Goto.
----------
Yemen's parliament postponed a planned vote on whether to accept the resignation of President Abd Rabu 
Mansour Hadi, who stepped down to protest the demands of Houthi rebels, who have overrun the capital, Sana'a. 
The state news agency Saba, which is controlled by the mainly Shiite Houthis, said the session had been delayed 
to allow members of the assembly to be notified. Hadi and the government of prime minister Khaled Bahah both 
resigned Thursday, a day after reaching an apparent deal with the rebel movement, which had surrounded their 
residences. The resignations left a political vacuum in Yemen with Houthi fighters in control of much of the north 
while Hadi loyalists in the south have said they will no longer take orders from Sana'a.
----------
The pro-Western government in Ukraine announced it plans to bring charges before the International Criminal Court 
in The Hague against the pro-Russian separatists it blames for the large number of civilian deaths in the east of 
Ukraine. The Ukrainian government would also like to have the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk and 
Lugansk declared a terrorist organization internationally. In response to Saturday's attack on the port city of 
Mariupol, in which at least 30 civilians were killed, Ukraine's National Security Council has ordered new weapons 
for its armed forces.
----------
The Islamist group Boko Haram has seized the important transport junction of Monguno during a simultaneous 
attack upon it and Maiduguri, a north-eastern state capital, Premium Times newspaper reported, citing security 
sources. The army and air force had repelled the attack on the capital of Borno state, which has a population of 1.2 
million people, but Premium Times reported many deaths in the attack.

Japanese hostage. "The Japanese hostage was executed after the expiration of a deadline that had been reported 
to Japan," an Islamic State spokesman said on the militant jihadist group's al-Bayan internet radio service. An 
internet video released Saturday contained an image of what appeared to be the lifeless remains of Haruna 
Yakawa, 42. Sunday's internet message was the first confirmation by an Islamic State source. The group continues 
to hold a second Japanese hostage, Kenji Goto.

Yemen's parliament postponed a planned vote on whether to accept the resignation of President Abd Rabu 
Mansour Hadi, who stepped down to protest the demands of Houthi rebels, who have overrun the capital, Sana'a. 
The state news agency Saba, which is controlled by the mainly Shiite Houthis, said the session had been delayed 
to allow members of the assembly to be notified. Hadi and the government of prime minister Khaled Bahah both 
resigned Thursday, a day after reaching an apparent deal with the rebel movement, which had surrounded their 
residences. The resignations left a political vacuum in Yemen with Houthi fighters in control of much of the north 
while Hadi loyalists in the south have said they will no longer take orders from Sana'a.

The pro-Western government in Ukraine announced it plans to bring charges before the International Criminal Court 
in The Hague against the pro-Russian separatists it blames for the large number of civilian deaths in the east of 
Ukraine. The Ukrainian government would also like to have the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk and 
Lugansk declared a terrorist organization internationally. In response to Saturday's attack on the port city of 
Mariupol, in which at least 30 civilians were killed, Ukraine's National Security Council has ordered new weapons 
for its armed forces.

The Islamist group Boko Haram has seized the important transport junction of Monguno during a simultaneous 
attack upon it and Maiduguri, a north-eastern state capital, Premium Times newspaper reported, citing security 
sources. The army and air force had repelled the attack on the capital of Borno state, which has a population of 1.2 
million people, but Premium Times reported many deaths in the attack.

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Michael O'Leary of Ryanair is promising USD100 round-trip fares between the US and 
Europe.
The CEO of the low cost Irish airline had told the Irish Independent they would be up and running within five years, 
and the goal would be to fly between 15 major European cities and 15 major US cities.
"We'll need something in the order of 30-50 aircraft," said O'Leary. "We're not interested in doing something small 
scale."
O'Leary said the fares would be available on a Ryanair new subsidiary and some could cost as low as USD10 as 
an incentive.
"The average price should be somewhere in the mid-EUR80s or mid-EUR90s." He said such a low-cost 
transatlantic airline fare could still make profits but would require cheap long-haul aircraft purchase.
O'Leary also is also looking at expansion to other countries such as Egypt, Turkey, Israel and Russia.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has been fined for a second time by the Italian competition 
watchdog, after it received a flood of complaints regarding the airliner's premium rate customer service phone line, 
The Telegraph reported on its website Friday. 
The AGCM fined Ryanair EUR550,000 after passengers said they found it "difficult and unreasonably expensive" to 
get reimbursements, find alternative flights following cancellations and receive detailed billing information for tax 
and expenses purposes, the newspaper said.
It is the second time Ryanair has been fined by AGCM. Last February, the airliner was hit by a EUR850,000 fine for 
the "lack of transparency in their travel insurance policies" and the "obstacles created in case of refund" during the 
online purchase of airline tickets.
Ryanair is set to appeal the decision, according to The Telegraph.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has put more pressure on Aer Lingus Group PLC to accept a bid 
from International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC after it speculated that the owner of British Airways and Iberia 
may return with a higher offer later this week, The Times reported on Tuesday.
Ryanair, which is the largest shareholder in Aer Lingus with a 29% stake, said IAG may have to put an offer of 
EUR2.50 to EUR2.70 per share on the table in order to win control of Aer Lingus. Its shares closed in London on 
Tuesday at EUR2.46 per share. 
Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, said at a meeting on Tuesday that it has not held talks with IAG 
and held no particular concerns about the company taking control of the Irish flag carrier.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Friday said it will offer "rescue fares" for customers affected by 
the collapse of Cyprus Airways earlier today after the European Commission ordered the Cyprian airliner to pay 
back slightly more than EUR65 million in illegal state aid.
Ryanair said the fares will start from EUR49.99 and "will help customers left stranded following the closure of 
Cyprus Airways," it said in a statement. The tickets will be available to customers travelling between January 9 to 
January 16. 
Ryanair will be offering flights from Athens and Thessaloniki to Paphos at EUR49.99, whilst flights from London 
Stansted to Paphos will start at GBP69.99. 
Cyprus Airways saw its operations suspended earlier today after Cypriot Finance Minister Harris Georgiades said 
the national carrier could not afford to repay the sum owed and said an administrator would be appointed to the 
company. 
The government has said it will offer alternative arrangements to all passengers who have Cyprus Airway tickets.
Ryanair shares closed up 0.9% to 9.43 pence per share on Friday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC Friday said its revised offer for Irish flag 
carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC has been rejected. 
IAG Group made a revised cash offer of EUR2.40 per Aer Lingus share, which was an improvement on the 
company's original offer of EUR2.30 per share. Aer Lingus has rejected the revised offer as it still feels it 
undervalues the company and IAG said there is no certainty another offer will be made. 
Aer Lingus has successfully fended off several takeover attempts by Ryanair Holdings PLC in recent years, thanks 
partly to the large stake held by the Irish government which was against the bid, and stakes held by its own 
employees. Ryanair's takeover attempts were also rejected by European Union anti-trust regulators.
IAG shares closed down 1.8% to 465.40 pence per share on Friday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low cost airline easyJet PLC Wednesday said it flew 65.3 million passengers in 2014, 
up 6.5% from 61.3 million in 2013, and its planes were also more full with its load factor rising 1.5 percentage points 
to 90.8%, while Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus reported higher higher passenger numbers, driven by growth in its long-
haul operations.
EasyJet said it flew 4.6 million passengers in December, up 3.2% from 4.5 million in December 2013, with its load 
factor up 0.5 percentage points to 88.4%.
Aer Lingus, meanwhile, flew 9.8 million passengers in 2014, up from 9.6 million in 2013, as growth in long-haul 
offset a decline in short-haul. Its key traffic measure in revenue passenger kilometres rose 8.7%, bigger than a 
7.8% increase in capacity measured in available seat kilometres, meaning its load factor rose 0.6 percentage points 
on the year to 79.0%.
The Irish airline's passenger numbers fell 4.5% in December to 619,000, from 648,000 a year earlier, as an 
increase in long-haul passengers proved insufficient to offset the decrease in short-haul. Still, traffic measured in 
revenue passenger kilometres rose 6.1% on the year. Capacity measured by available seat kilometres rose 8.8%, 
meaning its December load factor decreased 1.8%. 
On Monday, Ryanair Holdings PLC, which is Europe's largest low-cost carrier, had said it flew 6.02 million 
passengers in December, up from 5.02 million in December 2013, while its load factor rose to 88%, from 81%. That 
meant it flew 86.4 million passengers in 2014 as a whole, up 6% from 2013.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Deutsche Bank raises its price target for Ryanair, saying the next few years will be 
defined by a focus on how effectively the airline can fill its new capacity. 
"The early evidence is encouraging and we see earnings growth continuing into 2015 and 2016 as pent-up demand 
in both new and existing markets absorbs the lion's share of capacity growth," Deutsche says. "In addition we 
believe underlying pricing will improve on better product perception."
The bank says data from Ryanair’s initial capacity deployment is both encouraging and more importantly 
sustainable and its price target increase to EUR10.30 from EUR7.60 is a function of increased traffic expectations 
rather than any change to capacity or price.
Deutsche says a premium on the shares is justified because Ryanair is beginning to demonstrate that a renewed 
growth phase will not come at the expense of profitability. 
Downside risks to its forecasts and/or recommendation include force majeure closure of airspace, an unexpected 
deterioration in European GDP and competitor capacity or price responses that are worse than expected.
Still, the bank keeps the stock at Buy, saying near-term gains will be more challenging but a mature network and 
tough to replicate cost base should be able to achieve returns on capital of around 16% in the medium-term.
"Despite being in a sector that will always be subject to short-term risks we believe Ryanair will continue to be a 
medium-term winner in Europe," Deutsche says. 
In morning trade, Ryanair shares are down 1.1% at EUR9.82.

JENA (Alliance News) - The European markets were weak on Monday, amid concerns about falling oil prices and 
Greece leaving the eurozone in the wake of the snap elections scheduled in the debt-ridden country.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly said the eurozone could cope with a potential Greek exit if it was 
proved necessary. The anti-austerity party Syriza seems to have an upper hand in the snap election there.
On the economic front, a measure of Eurozone investor confidence unexpectedly rose for a third straight month, 
moving into the positive territory, led by Germany, survey data from the think tank Sentix showed. The investor 
confidence index climbed to 0.9 from -2.5 in December. Economists had forecast an improvement to -1.
German employment reached a record high for the eighth consecutive year in 2014, a report published by German 
statistical office Destatis said. An average of 42.598 million persons were employed in 2014, up 372,000 or 0.9% 
from the previous year.
At 8 am ET, Destatis is scheduled to release its flash consumer prices report. Consumer prices are expected to 
grow 0.3% year-over-year in December after a 0.6% rise in November. The harmonised index of consumer prices is 
estimated to increase 0.2%, following the 0.5% climb in November.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks was down 0.78%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, was losing 0.43%.
The German DAX fell 0.4%, while the French CAC 40 and the FTSE 100 index of the UK dropped 0.7% each. 
Switzerland's SMI, meanwhile, gained moderately.
In Frankfurt, Lanxess dropped 3.1% and sports goods giant adidas fell 1.7%.
BMW and Volkswagen were losing 1.2% each.
Bucking the trend, Deutsche Boerse gained 2.3% and Fresenius Medical Care advanced 2.1%.
European Markets Fall Amid Greek Worries As Oil Drops
In Paris, Total fell close to 2%. Oilfield services provider Technip was moderately lower.
Metal fabrication firm Vallourec dropped 1.7% and builder Vinci declined 1.5%.
Yet Airbus added 3.2% and Essilor International gained 2.4%.
In London, Weir Group declined around 4% and Aggreko dropped 2.7%.
Tullow Oil and BP were losing 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively.
Cruise company Carnival gained 3.3% and airlines International Consolidated Airlines and easyJet advanced 2.6% 
and 2% in that order.
Ryanair, which reported increased traffic and load factor for December, rose around 2%.
Citigroup reduced Repsol to "Neutral" from "Buy." The stock fell 2% in Madrid.
The Asian stocks ended mostly lower as lower crude oil prices and continued political turmoil in Greece 
overshadowed expectations of fresh European Central Bank stimulus.
In the US, futures point to a lower open on Wall Street. In the previous session, the major averages ended mixed 
showing little change as disappointing reports on US manufacturing and construction spending offset dovish 
comments from ECB President Mario Draghi.
Crude for February delivery fell USD1.02 to USD51.67 per barrel, while gold gained USD3.4 to USD1189.6 a troy 
ounce.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Tesco Chief Executive Dave Lewis is expected to outline a radical overhaul to the supermarket's relationships with 
its suppliers this week and is set to give a strong indication the company is heading for its first UK trading loss for 
some time, The Sunday Times reported. Senior sources at Tesco said Lewis is planning to scrap the system of 
rebates and penalty fees currently used to extract money from its suppliers. He is understood to be planning to 
replace this with a simplified system based on sales volume, the sources said.
----------
Investec has joined the list of international banks considering making a bid for Coutts International, the wealth 
management business being sold by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Sky News reported. Investec is 
understood to be among at least half a dozen parties to have expressed an interest in buying the business. The 
operation outside the UK is set to be sold in 2015, having been identified by RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan as 
a non-core operation. 
----------
JD Wetherspoon said it has reached an agreement with Dutch brewing company Heineken International to start 
stocking a range of its products again in its UK and Ireland pubs, following a fallout at the end of last year over 
pricing in Ireland. In December last year, the UK pub chain decided to stop serving Heineken products in all 926 of 
its British and Irish pubs following a row with the brewer over supplying its lager and Murphy's stout to one of its 
Wetherspoon pubs in Dublin. JD Wetherspoon said its UK pubs will now begin serving Heineken, Fosters, 
Kronenbourg 1664, Strongbow, John Smith’s Extra Smooth and Amstel again, while its pubs in the Republic of 
Ireland will serve Beamish, Fosters and Symonds Cider, but not Murphy's or Heineken.

Galliford Try said its Morrison construction unit has closed a GBP45.2 million contract to build and operate the first 
phase of the redevelopment of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. Morrison will carry out the construction, providing a 
new state-of-the-art specialist mental health facility on the western edge of the existing campus in Morningside, 
Edinburgh, the housebuilding and construction group said in a statement.
----------
Ryanair Holdings said it flew just over 6 million passengers in December, up 20% on a year earlier, while its planes 
were significantly more full. In a statement, Europe's largest low-cost carrier said it flew 6.02 million passengers in 
December, up from 5.02 million in December 2013, while its load factor rose to 88%, from 81%. That meant it flew 
86.4 million passengers in 2014 as a whole, up 6% from 2013.
----------
Xaar said it has appointed former Eastman Kodak Co executive Doug Edwards as its new chief executive with 
immediate effect, replacing Ian Dinwoodie who will retire this year having been at the helm for the past 12 years. 
Edwards was most recently president of digital printing and enterprise at Kodak, having previously held roles at 
Ilford Ltd, ICI, Zeneca and International Paper.
----------
Rangers International Football Club said it has received a takeover offer from American businessman Robert 
Sarver, just days after it revealed the acquisition of a tranche of shares by three investors, and said it has also 
secured a new financing facility from an existing shareholder. Rangers said Sarver, or a vehicle to be established 
and controlled by him, has made an approach to buy the club. It did not provide any financial details on the potential 
offer. Sarver is a Phoenix-based businessman who owns the National Basketball Association franchise the Phoenix 
Suns. 
----------
MARKETS
----------
UK shares have had a fairly volatile morning, trading mixed to lower as oil-related stocks are hit by another decline 
in the oil prices and concerns remain about a Greek exit from the eurozone.
----------
FTSE 100: down 0.6% at 6,509.58
FTSE 250: up 0.1% at 16,066.43
AIM ALL-SHARE: up 0.01% at 707.79
----------
Brent oil fell to another five-and-a-half year low at USD55.118 a barrel, continuing its downward spiral. The euro 
remains under pressure hitting its lowest level against the dollar since late February 2006, at USD1.1865.
----------
GBP-USD: down at USD1.5273
EUR-USD: down at USD1.1921
GOLD: up at USD1190.43 per ounce
OIL (Brent): down at USD55.24 a barrel
(changes since end of previous GMT day)
----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The strength of recovery in the UK construction sector moderated in December, survey data from Markit Economics 
showed. The Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-than-
expected to 57.6 in December from 59.4 in November. The score was forecast to fall to 59 in December. 
Nonetheless, the reading was higher than the long-run series average and well above the 50.0 value that separates 
expansion from contraction. Data highlighted divergent trends between the three broad categories of construction 
output monitored by the survey. House building and commercial construction increased at a slower pace, while civil 
engineering decreased slightly, ending a 17-month period of continuous expansion.
----------
TOP NEWS: Euro Hits 9-Year Low Against Dollar On Greek Worries
Berlin is prepared to accept a Greek exit from the European common currency if the country's next government 
does not continue to adhere to austerity measures, a report said. Both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble say they now see a Greek exit from the euro as bearable and even 
unavoidable if the radical leftwing Syriza party wins snap elections later this month and abandons planned cuts, 
Spiegel Online reported. A German government spokesman would not confirm the report to dpa on Sunday, but 
said: "Greece has complied with its obligations in the past. The federal government expects Greece to continue to 
comply with its obligations."
----------
Japan's manufacturing sector continued to expand at a steady pace in December, the latest survey from Markit 
Economics showed, with a PMI score of 52.0. That was unchanged from the November reading and remained 
above the boom-or-bust level of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.
----------
Zero visibility prevented Indonesian Navy divers from reaching large objects believed to be parts of an AirAsia plane 
that crashed with 162 people last week, the search chief said. Rescue officials said Saturday that ships equipped 
with sonar technology had detected four large objects they hoped were parts of AirAsia's Airbus A320-200 fuselage. 
"Today we sent two divers with the aim of reaching the biggest object, but visibility on the sea floor was zero and it 
was covered with mud," search chief Bambang Sulistyo said. "So the effort was suspended." A remotely operated 
undersea vehicle would be sent instead, he said.
----------
The condition of a British nurse being treated in London after contracting Ebola in Sierra Leone is now critical, 
doctors said. Pauline Cafferkey, 39, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on British soil, is in a specialist 
isolation ward. "The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust is sorry to announce that the condition of Pauline 
Cafferkey has gradually deteriorated over the past two days and is now critical," the hospital said in a statement 
Saturday.
----------
The Palestinians will resubmit to the Security Council a draft resolution that would impose on Israel a three-year 
deadline on ending the occupation, President Mahmoud Abbas said. The draft was rejected last week, with eight 
members of the 15-member Council voting in favour - one short of the nine needed to pass.
----------
North Korea accused the US government of unwarranted hostile actions in imposing new economic sanctions, after 
a cyberattack on the computers of a Hollywood film studio. US President Barack Obama announced the sanctions 
against three state organizations and 10 individuals as retaliation for an alleged cyber-attack at Sony Pictures 
Entertainment, which released a farcical film that Pyongyang found offensive. North Korea denied any involvement 
in the hacking. Some US computer security experts have also suggested the cyber-attack was perpetrated by 
disgruntled current or former Sony employees.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum says International Consolidated Airlines Group's approach for Aer Lingus 
makes sense, and would strengthen the group's position in the North Atlantic market, potentially allowing it to switch 
some transfer traffic to Dublin and free some Heathrow slots.
The owner of British Airways, and Iberia and Vueling in Spain, confirmed Thursday that a takeover offer for the Irish 
carrier was rejected on December 14, with Aer Lingus stating that it "fundamentally undervalues" the airline and its 
prospects.
Liberum says it envisages Aer Lingus being added to IAG as another operating company, rather than being 
integrated into one of the existing operating companies and says a potential takeover would improve IAG's ability to 
service transatlantic traffic to-and-from UK regions. The limited domestic network of British Airways currently limits 
the opportunities to target these markets, Liberum adds.
Aer Lingus would give IAG a relatively low cost long-haul operating platform, Liberum says, speculating that IAG 
might want to use Aer Lingus as a cost effective production platform to launch new long haul services from airports 
other than its current hubs, possibly through a white-label arrangement using a different brand.
The broker says the attitude of the Irish government, owner of a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, is crucial and an 
acquisition would be difficult without its consent. "In our view, the Irish government's priorities are the preservation 
of an extensive route network to support business travel and inbound tourism, the retention of services between 
Dublin and Heathrow, ensuring that Aer Lingus remains a strong competitive counter balance to Ryanair, and 
protecting employment," Liberum says.
The largest shareholder, Ryanair, is likely to be happy to sell its near-30% stake, especially if it is at a price that 
could see it make a modest profit on its long-standing investment, and getting both shareholders on board would 
account for more than 50% of the votes, Liberum says.
Liberum has a Buy rating on IAG and a 600 pence price target.

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC Thursday confirmed it has made an offer 
for Aer Lingus Group PLC, which the Irish flag carrier rejected as it felt the offer undervalued the company.
IAG shares were up 4.1% at 461.85 pence Thursday afternoon, with Aer Lingus shares trading 9.3% higher at 
EUR1.99 per share, having touched EUR2.15 earlier in the afternoon.
"IAG notes the recent movement in the share price of Aer Lingus and confirms it submitted a proposal to make an 
offer for the company, which has been rejected by the board of Aer Lingus," IAG said in a short statement.
"There can be no certainty that any further proposal or offer will be forthcoming," IAG added.
In a separate statement, Aer Lingus confirmed it received the offer from IAG on December 14, which it reviewed 
and rejected as it felt the offer undervalued the company.
"The board has reviewed the proposal and believes that it fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus and its attractive 
prospects. Accordingly, the proposal was rejected on 16 December," Aer Lingus said.
Aer Lingus has successfully fended off several takeover attempts by Ryanair Holdings PLC in recent years, thanks 
partly to the large stake held by the Irish government which was against the bid, and stakes held by its own 
employees. Ryanair's takeover attempts were also rejected by European Union anti-trust regulators. 
However, Ryanair still has a 29.82% stake in Aer Lingus, and so IAG would need the support of Europe's biggest 
low-cost airline as well as the Irish government, which has a 25.11% stake, if it is to succeed with a takeover.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Jefferies and Liberum both like Ryanair's raised full-year earnings guidance and lift their 
target prices for the airline and reiterate their Buy rating on the stock.
Liberum says the increase to net profit guidance for the year to March 2015 of between EUR810 million and 
EUR830 million, provided by Ryanair on Thursday, appears to be driven by the success of its strategy to reposition 
itself to pursue unit revenue improvements, rather than unit cost reductions alone.
The broker says the increased guidance is driven not by cheaper fuel but by new, higher frequency business-
friendly routes that are outperforming and by other changes that are driving significant load factor improvements. 
"We believe there is more to come, which is positive for Ryanair, but ominous for the competition," Liberum adds, 
raising its price target on the stock to EUR10.50 from EUR9.50. Net profit for 2015 is now forecast at EUR846.1 
million up from EUR784.7 million, 2016 is raised to EUR982.1 million from EUR869.4 million, and 2017 to EUR1.02 
billion from EUR1 billion.
Jefferies says Ryanair's evolving business model is driving improved financial performance, noting that the 22% 
passenger growth in November, the first month of the expanded Winter schedule, was well ahead of its 
expectations. Load factor increased to 88% and are particularly strong across a number of city pair markets where 
business-type frequencies are being offered.
The broker adds that commercial changes are being felt as load factors build up earlier and customer-friendly 
initiatives are rolled out, such as a new website, allocated seating, reduced fees/charges.
In its latest such customer-friendly initiative, Ryanair on Friday said it will refund the GBP13 air passenger duty for 
all children under 12 who check-in on flights leaving the UK from March 27, 2015, six weeks earlier than the May 1 
date set in the UK Autumn Statement for the tax to be abolished for that age range. It said the refund will cost the 
company up to GBP2 million over the six week period.
IN THE KNOW: Jefferies And Liberum Like Ryanair 's Guidance Lift
Jefferies raises its net profit forecast for the year to March 2015 to EUR822 million from EUR775 million, to EUR907 
million from EUR888 million for 2016, and to EUR1.04 billion from EUR960 million in 2017.
Jefferies raises its price target on the stock to EUR10.50 from EUR10.
In early trading, Ryanair shares in London are up 1.3% at EUR9.57.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Friday said it is opening its 
fourth Portuguese base in the Azores from April 2015, as it invests USD100 million in the Azores region.
Ryanair said the base will include one Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and will include three new routes to London 
Stansted, Lisbon and Porto, making a total of 20 weekly flights. It said it will deliver 350,000 customers per year and 
support 350 "on site" jobs per year.
"Ryanair welcomes the government's decision to open the Azorean market to competition to the benefit of island 
residents, tourists and consumers," the airline operator said in a statement.
Ryanair said it is also in discussions with the government of the Azores about possible services to Terceira and 
additional international flights to the Islands. 
The airline announced earlier Friday that it will refund the GBP13 air passenger duty for all children under 12 who 
check-in on flights leaving the UK from March 27, 2015, six weeks earlier than the May 1 date set in the UK Autumn 
Statement for the tax to be abolished for that age range.
Addressing Parliament on Wednesday, Chancellor George Osborne said APD will be scrapped from May 2015 for 
children under 12 and for children under 16 the following year, news which boosted airline stocks on Wednesday.
Ryanair said it will refund children's duty on UK flights from March 27, noting this will cover the Easter holiday 
period.
On Thursday, Ryanair raised its financial 2015 passenger and profit guidance for a third time in as many months as 
business passengers rushed to fill the new routes it recently announced.
It said it now expects its after-tax profit in the financial year to March 2015 to be between EUR810 million and 
EUR830 million, up from its previous guidance of between EUR750 million and EUR770 million, and to fly over 90 
million passengers, up from its previous expectation of 89 million.
Ryanair To Open New Base In Azores From April 2015
Ryanair had previously raised its guidance in early November, after reporting strong growth in profit and revenue in 
the first half, driven by higher passenger numbers, average fares and lower fuel costs. It had also raised guidance 
in September, citing the recent launch of its new service for business travellers and the efforts it is making to 
improve its overall customer relations.
Ryanair shares were trading 1.4% higher Friday mid-morning at EUR9.58 per share.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum says don't rule out further improvement at Ryanair after the airline raised 
guidance for the current year to March 2015, with the company now expecting net profit to be between EUR810 
million and EUR830 million, an 8% increase compared with the previous guidance range. 
"The catalyst for the improved outlook appears to have been the stronger-than-expected performance on new 
business friendly routes, the Always Getting Better customer offering improvements, and taking forward bookings 
earlier," Liberum says.
The most encouraging element of the improved guidance is that it appears to be driven by Ryanair's strategy being 
more effective than anticipated, evident in the November traffic statistics, the broker says. It adds that the arrival of 
new aircraft and the launch of the new winter schedule saw passenger numbers surge by 22%, the fastest growth 
rate in more than six years, and a move closer to easyJet's load factor of 90%. 
Liberum says Ryanair has a long history of conservative profit guidance, but with a March year end and the 
seasonally weaker winter period usually being loss-making it had expected limited scope for further upgrades. It 
says the improved guidance should be seen as a genuine surprise with consensus sitting towards the lower end of 
the old guidance range of EUR750 million to EUR770 million.
Liberum has a Buy rating on the stock with a EUR9.50 price target.
In morning trading, Ryanair shares are up 7.5% at EUR9.37.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Thursday raised its 2014 
passenger and profit guidance for a third time in as many months as business passengers rushed to fill the new 
routes it recently announced, while big rival easyJet PLC also said passenger numbers continued rising in 
November.
Ryanair said it now expects its 2014 after-tax profit to be between EUR810 million and EUR830 million, up from its 
previous guidance of between EUR750 million and EUR770 million, and to fly over 90 million passengers, up from 
its previous expectation of 89 million.
Ryanair had previously raised its guidance in early November, after reporting strong growth in profit and revenue in 
the first half, driven by higher passenger numbers, average fares and lower fuel costs. It had also raised guidance 
in September, citing the recent launch of its new service for business travelers and the efforts it is making to 
improve its overall customer relations.
The Irish airline has expanded its winter schedule, adding new routes from the likes of Dublin, Warsaw and London 
Stansted. It said demand for the new routes, which were designed to appeal to business travel, had been very 
strong and the planes were more full than it had anticipated. 
"Despite increasing November seat capacity by 13% (over November 13) and opening a large number of new city 
pair routes designed to appeal to business traffic, Ryanair's November load factor rose by 7% points from 81% in 
2013 to 88% in 2014," it said in its statement Thursday.
The airline recently set out to woo business travellers after its big rival easyJet attracted large numbers of business 
travellers moving off scheduled airlines in the wake of the financial crisis. It  launched its own business class service 
offering features like premium seats, priority boarding and flexible tickets.
2nd UPDATE: Ryanair Raises Guidance As New Routes Fill, EasyJet Traffic Rises
Ryanair said first month load factor on the three new routes it opened between Dublin and Brussels, Glasgow and 
Cologne was 80%, while it was 88% on the routes between London Stanstead and Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lisbon, 
Athens and Cologne. It also reported load factor of 82% on the new routes between Warsaw and Gdansk and 
Wroclaw, and 90% on the new routes between Lisbon and Hamburg, Rome and Milan.
The new routes from Warsaw and Lisbon were launched in direct competition with Portuguese carrier TAP and 
Polish carrier LOT.
Ryanair said it carried 6.4 million passengers in November, up from 5.2 million a year earlier. Its overall load factor 
rose to 88%, from 81%. On a rolling 12 month basis to the end of Novermber, Ryanair's passenger numbers were 
up 5% to 85.4 million passengers.
Big rival easyJet, which had raised its own profit guidance in early October after it took passengers from strike-hit 
Air France, said it carried 4.4 million passengers in November, up 3.1% from 4.3 million a year earlier, and its 
planes were also more full, with load factor rising to 89.5%, from 89.0%.
On a rolling 12 month basis, the low-cost airline carried 65.2 million passengers in the 12 months to end-November, 
up from 61.2 million in the previous 12 months. Load factor rose to 90.8%, from 89.3%.
Aer Lingus Group PLC, which as a scheduled airline offering long- and short-haul flights uses the industry traffic 
measurement of revenue passenger kilometres as its preferred benchmark, said traffic using this measure rose by 
7.5% in November, buoyed by continued strong growth in long-haul that offset a continued contraction in short-haul.
In passenger number terms, 28.4% growth in long-haul passengers wasn't enough to offset a 9.1% contraction in 
its larger short-haul operations, and overall passenger numbers fell 4.4% to 613,000.
The growth in traffic in revenue passenger kilometres wasn't enough to match an 8.5% increase in capacity 
measured in available seat kilomtres, and hence its load factor fell 0.7 percentage points to 72.6%.
In the first 11 months of 2014, Aer Lingus passenger numbers are up 1.9% on the first 11 months o 2013, and its 
traffic in revenue passenger kilometres is up 8.8%. That's better than a 7.7% rise in available seat kilometres, 
meaning load factor for the 11 month period is up 0.8 percentage points.
Ryanair shares were up 7.9% at EUR9.41 in London Thursday morning, while easyJet was up 2.1% at 1,703.64 
pence, one of the best-performing stocks on the FTSE 100. Aer Lingus shares were up 1.9% at EUR1.76.

European Stocks Come Under Pressure Amid Disappointment With Draghi
European Stocks Come Under Pressure Amid Disappointment With Draghi

VIENNA (Alliance News) - After seeing early strength, European stocks moved mostly lower over the course of the 
trading day on Thursday. The losses on the day came after the major markets ended the previous session mixed.
The pullback by European stocks reflected a negative reaction to remarks by European Central Bank President 
Mario Draghi, who spoke to reporters following the bank's decision to keep interest rates unchanged at record lows.
While Draghi reiterated that the ECB remains committed to providing additional stimulus if needed, traders seemed 
disappointed that the bank did not adopt quantitative easing today.
Draghi said the bank's Governing Council will wait until next quarter to reassess current stimulus and specifically 
called for an evaluation of the impact of the recent drop in oil prices.
"If there is any surprise in the reaction, it is that Draghi still has enough credibility to move markets considering the 
determined opposition he faces on the governing council," said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial. "We'll 
see how long it lasts if he continues to disappoint in 2015."
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chip stocks plunged by 1.7%. Around Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 Index 
fell by 0.6%, while the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index tumbled by 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively.
In corporate news, UK travel company TUI Travel, which has agreed to merge with TUI AG, reported better than 
expected full year underlying profit.
Meanwhile, UK luxury retailer Mulberry reported a loss for its first half, dragged lower by higher costs and lower 
revenues.
Irish low cost airlines Ryanair reported a 22% increase in traffic for November and raised its profit forecast for the 
full year.
European Stocks Come Under Pressure Amid Disappointment With Draghi
On the economic front, a report released by French statistical office INSEE showed that the jobless rate in France 
calculated based on ILO standards rose to 10.4% in the third quarter from 10.1% in the second quarter. Economists 
expected the jobless rate to come in at 10.3%.
Many of the stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw considerable strength on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 
225 Index advanced by 0.9%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped by 1.7% and China's Shanghai Composite 
Index soared by 4.3%.
Meanwhile, US stocks have moved mostly lower on the day amid a negative reaction to Draghi's remarks. The 
major averages have all slid into the red, with the Dow and the S&P 500 pulling back off yesterday's record closing 
highs.
In commodities trading, crude for January delivery is falling USD0.89 to USD66.49 a barrel, while gold for February 
delivery is inching up USD0.10 to USD1,208.80 an ounce.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Travel stocks are amongst the best performers in the FTSE 100 Thursday, after 
Ryanair Holdings lifted its earnings guidance, TUI Travel reported strong results, easyJet said passenger numbers 
are continuing to climb, and the oil price continued to hover around its recent lows.
Ryanair shares are up 7.5% after Europe's largest low-cost carrier raised its 2014 passenger and profit guidance for 
a third time in as many months, saying business passengers were rushing to fill planes on the new routes it recently 
announced. 
Ryanair said it now expects its 2014 after-tax profit to be between EUR810 million and EUR830 million, up from its 
previous guidance of between EUR750 million and EUR770 million, and to fly over 90 million passengers, up from 
its previous expectation of 89 million.
The Irish airline has expanded its winter schedule, adding new routes from the likes of Dublin, Lisbon, Warsaw and 
London Stansted. It said demand for the new routes, which were designed to appeal to business travel, had been 
very strong and the planes were more full than it had anticipated.
It had specifically targeted local carriers TAP and LOT with its new routes from Lisbon and Warsaw, respectively.
Ryanair said it carried 6.4 million passengers in November, up from 5.2 million a year earlier. Its overall load factor 
rose to 88%, from 81%. On a rolling 12 month basis to the end of Novermber, Ryanair's passenger numbers were 
up 5% to 85.4 million passengers.
Big rival easyJet, which had raised its own profit guidance in early October after it took passengers from strike-hit 
Air France, said it carried 4.4 million passengers in November, up 3.1% from 4.3 million a year earlier, and its 
planes were also more full, with load factor rising to 89.5%, from 89.0%.

On a rolling 12 month basis, the low-cost airline carried 65.2 million passengers in the 12 months to end-November, 
up from 61.2 million in the previous 12 months. Load factor rose to 90.8%, from 89.3%.
EasyJet shares are up 1.7%, making it one of the best-performers in the FTSE 100.
Travel operator TUI Travel, meanwhile, is up 4.1% after it posted a higher profit for its last financial year, driven by 
strong performances in the UK, Germany and Netherlands, together with the halving of losses from its French tour 
operating business. 
In its last set of results before it merges with German parent company TUI AG, TUI Travel reported a pretax profit of 
GBP362 million for the year ended September 30, compared with a GBP169 million profit the prior year, when it 
booked GBP188 million in impairments.
The travel operator, which owns Thomson and First Choice, declared a dividend of 24.55 pence per share for the 
year, 20.5 pence of which it said will be payable on completion of the merger. Last year its dividend for the year was 
13.5 pence.
Shares in consumer goods giant Unilever are also higher after it announced in an investor presentation that it will 
spin off its struggling spreads business next year. It said the unit will focus on developed markets only, and will 
have its own "dedicated management team". 
It said the standalone business will benefit from improved trade-offs and scale, while having the "freedom to take 
necessary decisions". The company's spreads business, which includes the Flora and Bertolli brands, has been 
struggling, dragging down growth elsewhere in the group.
The housebuilders are also amongst the best-performing stocks in both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250. They got a 
boost Wednesday when UK Chancellor of the Exchequer revamped the stamp duty regime, and got a further boost 
Thursday morning when the latest Halifax house price index showed that UK house prices rose more-than-
expected in November, after declining in the previous month.
FTSE 100-listed Persimmon is up 3.1%, while Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey, which will join it in the 
FTSE 100 at the start of Christmas week, are up 3.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Bellway and Crest Nicholson are up 
3.5%, Redrow is up 3.2% and Bovis Homes is up 2.9%.
UBS has maintained its positive stance on the sector, and raised price target for six of the seven stocks it covers. It 
expects a return potential on a 12 month view of around 20% on average for the stocks in its coverage.
Equity markets Thursday afternoon will be driven by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, with 
expectations running high that he will move closer to full-blown quantitative easing through government bond 
purchases.
The ECB is expected to leave interest rates on hold at 1245 GMT, but ECB President Mario Draghi's speech at 
1330 GMT again will be the focus for investors after he previously talked up the bank's future plans to introduce a 
new round of stimulus measures, including possible purchase of sovereign debt to add liquidity and spur growth in 
the struggling eurozone economy. 
The Bank of England just left interest rates unchanged, as expected.
----------
Markets: UK stocks are trading marginally higher, supported by strong UK earnings, positive markets in Asia, and 
expectations that the European Central Bank will move closer to full-blown quantitative easing through government 
bond purchases.

expectations he would respond to BT Group PLC's plans to expand with the acquisition of a mobile operator by 
making a swoop for fixed-line assets across Europe, including Liberty. Colao said he would look at buying Liberty's 
German cable assets, should Liberty be open to selling, but said its other networks in countries like Switzerland and 
Belgium would not be relevant to Vodafone's business, the paper said.

Betfair Group announced a GBP200 million cash return to its shareholders, after it said it doubled its pretax profit in

increased its medium term dividend payout target to approximately 50% of earnings, after reporting a pretax profit 
of GBP67.3 million for the half-year ended October 31, up from GBP31.7 million the prior year, driven by a 26% 
increase in revenue to GBP237.6 million, from GBP188 million.
----------
DS Smith posted a rise in pretax profit in the first half as it brought down costs sufficiently to offset a decline in 
revenue driven by the strength of sterling. The FTSE 250 packaging company said its pretax profit for the six

compared the first half. AG Barr said its revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to lower promotional 
activity, wholesaler destocking and competitive pricing in the soft drinks market. The drinks company said it has 
been focusing on controlling costs and said its margins remain in line with expectations despite the pricing

its working capital needs. Belgravium Technologies is down after it warned its full-year results will be below 
expectations after a big contract award that it had been expecting was deferred into 2015. That news offset a new

Top Economics And General

UK house prices rose more-than-expected in November, after declining in the previous month, survey data from the 
Lloyds Banking Group unit Halifax showed. House prices climbed 0.4% monthly in November, in contrast to a 0.4% 
decline in October. Economists had forecast a 0.3% rise for the month. During the three months to November, 
house prices rose 0.7% from the previous three months, following a 0.9% increase in the three months to October. 
The rate of growth eased for the fourth consecutive quarter in a row.
----------
The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest rates on hold Thursday, but with ECB chief Mario Draghi 
again talking up the bank's future plans to introduce a new round of stimulus measures to spur growth in the 
struggling eurozone economy. The ECB last cut rates in September when it lowered its benchmark refinancing rate 
to a historic low of just 0.05% and pushed its deposit rate deeper into negative territory. This week's meeting 
represents the first time that the bank's 24-head governing council has met in the ECB's new headquarters located 
in a 45-floor twin-tower skyscraper at the site of an old wholesale fruit and vegetable market in the eastern part of 
Frankfurt.
----------
France's ILO unemployment rate rose more-than-expected in the third quarter after holding steady in the previous 
two quarters to a 2013-peak, provisional figures from INSEE showed. The ILO jobless rate for metropolitan France 
and overseas departments climbed to 10.4% from a revised 10.1% in the second quarter. Economists had forecast 
a figure 10.3%. The latest rate equalled that of the second quarter of 2013. The figure was the highest since the 
fourth quarter of 1997, when it was 10.6%.
----------
New rules for planting genetically modified crops cleared an important hurdle at the European Union. Individual 
member countries are to be given more control over banning GM crops in their own agriculture industry. Negotiators 
of the EU states and the European Parliament agreed to a compromise, according to sources from both sides who 
talked to dpa. The agreement however still faced more hurdles. The result of the negotiations must be confirmed by 
the ambassadors of the 28 EU states. That could happen on December 10, according to preliminary information. A 
confirmation from the environmental committee of the European Parliament would also be needed.
----------
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is set to keep hold of power in elections this month, with a poll predicting it 
to win more than 300 of the legislature's 475 seats, a news report said. The figure beats the goal set by Prime 
Minister Shinzo Abe of 238 seats between the LDP and its coalition partner Komeito, and is also more than the 295 
held by the LDP in the previous assembly.
----------
Australia may follow Britain in imposing a special levy on profits generated by large corporations inside the country, 
the so-called "Google tax," a media report said. Treasurer Joe Hockey told the Sydney Morning Herald he had been 
in discussions with the British government on this matter and would have "more to say soon."
----------
US President Barack Obama says he is not optimistic that Russian President Vladimir Putin will change course on 
Ukraine but rather will keep on with actions that unsettle the region. "In part because I think the situation in Ukraine 
caught him by surprise, he has been improvising himself into a nationalist backward-looking approach to Russian 
policy that is scaring the heck out of his neighbors and is badly damaging his economy," Obama tells business 
leaders. Obama says that Putin would not change his mindset until "the politics inside of Russia catch up to what's 
happening in the economy inside of Russia."

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stocks across Europe closed lower Thursday after European Central Bank President 
Mario Draghi failed to introduce any further stimulus to the struggling European economy but said the bank will 
reassess existing measures in early 2015.
"Early next year the Governing Council will reassess the monetary stimulus achieved, the expansion of the balance 
sheet and the outlook for price developments. We will also evaluate the broader impact of recent oil price 
developments on medium-term inflation trends in the euro area," Draghi said in his introductory statement at the 
customary post-rate-decision press conference, held for the first time at the new ECB headquarters building in 
Frankfurt.
"Should it become necessary to further address risks of too-prolonged a period of low inflation, the Governing 
Council remains unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate. 
This would imply altering early next year the size, pace and composition of our measures," Draghi added.
In the subsequent questioning, Draghi told journalists that the bank does not need unanimity to make the decision 
to initiate quantitative easing, which provided some relief for stocks. 
"Despite what appeared to be his best efforts at appearing doveish and open to stronger unconventional stimulus 
efforts, the markets were simply disappointed that the job of fighting deflation had been passed off to next year. We 
may not have expected QE today but the least we wanted was a strong sign that it is to come and Draghi was very 
non-committal," said Craig Erlam, a market analyst at Alpari. 
The ECB also decided to leave its key interest rates unchanged.
During the press conference the Euro rose off its two-year lows against the dollar, and reach an intraday high of 
USD1.2456.

The FTSE 100 closed down 0.6% at 6,679.37, and the FTSE AIM All-Share ended down 0.1% at 710.50. 
Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 closed up 0.2% at 15,840.51.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 1.7%, and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt closed down 1.2%.
US stocks were broadly lower at the closed of London equity trade, with the DJIA down 0.5%, the S&P 500 down 
0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.3%. 
The Bank of England was in focus earlier in the day, as it kept its interest rate unchanged at the historic low of 
0.5%, and maintained its asset purchase facility at GBP375 billion. The decision by the Monetary Policy Committee 
came as no surprise to the market, with most forecasts suggesting a rate hike will be made in 2015. 
On the London Stock Exchange, travel stocks were amongst the gainers after Ryanair Holdings lifted its earnings 
guidance, TUI Travel reported strong results, easyJet said passenger numbers are continuing to climb, and oil 
prices continued to hover around their recent lows.
Ryanair shares closed up 8.3% after Europe's largest low-cost carrier raised its 2014 passenger and profit guidance 
for a third time in as many months, saying business passengers were rushing to fill planes on the new business-
friendly routes it recently announced. 
Rival easyJet, which had raised its own profit guidance in early October after it took passengers from strike-hit Air 
France, said it carried 4.4 million passengers in November, up 3.1% from 4.3 million a year earlier, and its planes 
were also more full, with load factor rising to 89.5% from 89.0%. EasyJet shares closed up 2.9%.
UK travel operator TUI Travel, closed up 3.6%, after posting a higher profit for its last financial year, driven by 
strong demand in the UK, Germany and Netherlands for its higher margin "unique holidays", together with the 
halving of losses from its French tour operating business.
Brent crude oil was quoted at the European equity close at USD69.35 a barrel, lower on the day. 
Sage Group ended as the best performing blue-chip stock, up 6.5%. The software and a services company had its 
price target increased by UBS, Citigroup, and Credit Suisse on Thursday after Sage had reiterated on Wednesday 
its confidence in achieving its financial targets. 
Severn Trent closed as the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 3.2%, after it went ex-dividend, meaning new 
buyers no longer qualify for the latest dividend payouts. 
Meanwhile, miners Anglo American, down 2.8%, Rio Tinto, down 2.6%, BHP Billiton, down 1.2%, and Ferrexpo, 
down 8.2%, suffered on the back of downgrades by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. According to traders, the bank 
cut Anglo-American, Rio Tinto and Ferrexpo to Underperform from Buy and lowered BHP Billiton to Neutral from 
Buy. 
Betfair Group ended as the best performing mid-cap stock, up 7.6%. The online betting company announced a 
GBP200 million cash return to its shareholders after it said it doubled its pretax profit in the first half of the year, 
driven by a 26% increase in revenue on the back of growth, favourable sports results and a World Cup boost. 
The company raised its interim dividend by 50% to 9.0 pence per share, and increased its medium-term dividend 
payout target to approximately 50% of earnings, after reporting a pretax profit of GBP67.3 million for the half-year 
ended October 31, up from GBP31.7 million the prior year, driven by a 26% increase in revenue to GBP237.6 
million from GBP188 million.
MARKET COMMENT: UK Shares Close Lower As Draghi Disappoints
DS Smith was another strong performer, up 5.4%, as the packaging company posted a rise in pretax profit in the 
first half as it brought down costs sufficiently to offset a decline in revenue driven by the strength of sterling. 
The company said its pretax profit for the six months to October 31 was GBP123 million, up from GBP85 million last 
year. Revenue dropped to GBP1.97 billion from GBP2.08 billion last year, but its operating costs dropped to 
GBP1.80 billion from GBP1.92 billion a year earlier and its exceptional costs fell to GBP10 million from GBP25 
million.
The focus of the economic calendar on Friday will be US nonfarm payrolls for November at 1330 GMT, with wage 
data released at the same time. Ahead of that reading will be UK consumer inflation expectations from the Bank of 
England at 0930 GMT, and GDP data from the Eurozone at 1000 GMT.
In the corporate calendar housebuilder Berkeley Group Holdings will report half-year results, Majedie Investments 
will release full-year results, and staffing business SThree will issue a trading update.

Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever said it will spin off its struggling spreads business next year. In a 
presentation at an Investor Day in London, Unilever said it will spin-off its baking, cooking and spreading division 
into a standalone business, which will be fully operational by mid 2015. It said the unit will focus on developed 
markets only, alongside its own "dedicated management team". It said the standalone business will benefit from

Ryanair Holdings, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, raised its 2014 passenger and profit guidance for a third time in 
as many months as business passengers rushed to fill the new routes it recently announced, while big rival easyJet

be between EUR810 million and EUR830 million, up from its previous guidance of between EUR750 million and 
EUR770 million, and to fly over 90 million passengers, up from its previous expectation of 89 million.The Irish airline

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK house prices rose more-than-expected in November, after declining in the previous month, survey data from the 
Lloyds Banking Group unit Halifax showed. House prices climbed 0.4% monthly in November, in contrast to a 0.4% 
decline in October. Economists had forecast a 0.3% rise for the month. During the three months to November, 
house prices rose 0.7% from the previous three months, following a 0.9% increase in the three months to October. 
The rate of growth eased for the fourth consecutive quarter in a row.
----------
The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest rates on hold Thursday, but with ECB chief Mario Draghi 
again talking up the bank's future plans to introduce a new round of stimulus measures to spur growth in the 
struggling eurozone economy. The ECB last cut rates in September when it lowered its benchmark refinancing rate 
to a historic low of just 0.05% and pushed its deposit rate deeper into negative territory. This week's meeting 
represents the first time that the bank's 24-head governing council has met in the ECB's new headquarters located 
in a 45-floor twin-tower skyscraper at the site of an old wholesale fruit and vegetable market in the eastern part of 
Frankfurt.
----------
France's ILO unemployment rate rose more-than-expected in the third quarter after holding steady in the previous 
two quarters to a 2013-peak, provisional figures from INSEE showed. The ILO jobless rate for metropolitan France 
and overseas departments climbed to 10.4% from a revised 10.1% in the second quarter. Economists had forecast 
a figure 10.3%. The latest rate equalled that of the second quarter of 2013. The figure was the highest since the 
fourth quarter of 1997, when it was 10.6%.
----------
New rules for planting genetically modified crops cleared an important hurdle at the European Union. Individual 
member countries are to be given more control over banning GM crops in their own agriculture industry. Negotiators 
of the EU states and the European Parliament agreed to a compromise, according to sources from both sides who 
talked to dpa. The agreement however still faced more hurdles. The result of the negotiations must be confirmed by 
the ambassadors of the 28 EU states. That could happen on December 10, according to preliminary information. A 
confirmation from the environmental committee of the European Parliament would also be needed.
----------
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is set to keep hold of power in elections this month, with a poll predicting it 
to win more than 300 of the legislature's 475 seats, a news report said. The figure beats the goal set by Prime 
Minister Shinzo Abe of 238 seats between the LDP and its coalition partner Komeito, and is also more than the 295 
held by the LDP in the previous assembly.
----------
Australia may follow Britain in imposing a special levy on profits generated by large corporations inside the country, 
the so-called "Google tax," a media report said. Treasurer Joe Hockey told the Sydney Morning Herald he had been 
in discussions with the British government on this matter and would have "more to say soon."
----------
US President Barack Obama says he is not optimistic that Russian President Vladimir Putin will change course on 
Ukraine but rather will keep on with actions that unsettle the region. "In part because I think the situation in Ukraine 
caught him by surprise, he has been improvising himself into a nationalist backward-looking approach to Russian 
policy that is scaring the heck out of his neighbors and is badly damaging his economy," Obama tells business 
leaders. Obama says that Putin would not change his mindset until "the politics inside of Russia catch up to what's 
happening in the economy inside of Russia."
----------
A new wave of anger erupted lin New York after a grand jury spared a white police officer criminal charges in the 
chokehold death of an unarmed African American. The decision came less than two weeks after violence erupted in 
Ferguson, Missouri, after a grand jury did not indict a white police officer for shooting and killing unarmed black 
teenager Michael Brown in August.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UK stocks are trading marginally higher Thursday, supported by strong UK earnings, 
positive markets in Asia, and expectations that the European Central Bank will move closer to full-blown 
quantitative easing through government bond purchases.
The FTSE 100 is up 2 points at 6,718.33, the FTSE 250 is up 0.6% at 15,907 and flirting with a one-week high, and 
the AIM All-Share index is unchanged on the day at 711.8.
The ECB is expected to leave interest rates on hold at 1245 GMT, but ECB President Mario Draghi's speech at 
1330 GMT again will be the focus for investors after talking up the bank's future plans to introduce a new round of 
stimulus measures, including the possible purchase of sovereign debt to add liquidity and spur growth in the 
struggling eurozone economy. 
A steady stream of data has underlined the weak state of the eurozone, with a plunge in oil prices driving annual 
inflation down to 0.3% in November, well short of the ECB's annual inflation target of just below 2%.
US markets are forecast to build on Wednesday's record closing levels. The DJIA is called to open up 0.1% after 
ending the day above 17,900 for the first time in its history, while the S&P 500 is expected to open flat and the 
Nasdaq 100 is called up 0.1%.
"An indication of further ECB stimulus could see large cap multinational US shares outperform with the Dow 
possibly outperforming the S&P 500 given the greater exposure to Europe," says Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets. 
The Bank of England will publish its interest rate decision at 1200 GMT and the US releases weekly jobless claims 
at 1330 GMT.
Housebuilders are among the biggest rising stocks in London Thursday morning, as investors welcome the 
changes to stamp duty by Chancellor George Osborne in Wednesday's Autumn Statement and a bigger-than-
expected 0.4% rise in U.K house prices in November, according to survey data from the Lloyds Banking Group unit 
Halifax .

Taylor Wimpeyup 3.6%, Crest Nicholson up 3.5%, Barratt Developments up 2.8% and Redrow up 3.2.
In corporate news, TUI Travel is the second highest riser in the FTSE 100, up 3.8%, after the tour operator said full-
year pretax profit rose to GBP362 million, driven by strong performances in the UK, Germany and Netherlands, 
together with the halving of losses from its French tour operating business. It said bookings for Summer 2015 are 
strong, in contrast to rival Thomas Cook, which has expressed caution about Summer 2015 bookings.
Airlines Ryanair and easyJet are up 7.7% and 1.9%, respectively. The Irish airline raised its profit guidance for a 
third time in as many months as it attracted more business passengers, while big rival easyJet also said passenger 
numbers continued rising in November.
Betfair is the leading gainer in the FTSE 250, up 7.1%, after announcing a GBP200 million cash return to its 
shareholders as pretax profit doubled in the first half of the year, driven by a 26% increase in revenue.
Packaging company DS Smith is up 6% after reporting first-half pretax profit climbed 45% to GBP123 million, as 
operating costs fell, adding that its outlook remains positive as the business continues to grow, despite ongoing 
economic headwinds in many of its markets.
Energy and resource stocks are among the fallers, snapping back from gains on Wednesday as Brent crude briefly 
dipped below USD70 a barrel for the second time in as many days. Anglo American is down 2.5%.  Rio Tinto is 
down 2.2% and BHP Billiton is down 1.8%, after downgrades from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Royal Dutch 
Shell is down 1% and BP is 0.7% lower.
Asian stock markets ended higher Thursday, tracking Wall Street gains after an upbeat report on US service sector 
activity.
In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 Index closed up 0.9% at 17,887.21, helped by a weak yen which benefits 
Japan's exporters. The US dollar rose to a fresh seven-year high near JPY120.
The Hang Seng closed up 1.7% and the Shanghai Composite ended up 4.3% at a new three-year high.

and profit in the full year will be up on 2013, but its shares slid as it warned its results will still be below hopes due to 
the contract award delay.

Pilots' Strike Results In Lufthansa Cancelling Half Long-Haul Flights
Pilots' Strike Results In Lufthansa Cancelling Half Long-Haul Flights

Frankfurt (Alliance News) - Lufthansa pilots launched on Thursday their second strike this week over an early 
retirement scheme bringing to a halt about half of the German airline's scheduled long-haul flights.
The strike, from 0200 until 2259 GMT, came after the pilots' union Cockpit rejected on Wednesday an offer from 
Lufthansa for mediation.
The industrial action resulted in Lufthansa cancelling 37 long-haul flights and six cargo flights just as the key 
Christmas travel period was getting underway.
The pilots' action came one day after Lufthansa announced plans to boost its budget airline operations in the face 
of tough competition from low-cost carriers, including Ryanair and easyJet and emerging Middle East-based airlines 
such as Etihad, Emirates and Qatar.
Thursday's strike, which is the pilots' 10th this year, follows Lufthansa's plans to raise the pilots' retirement age from 
55 to 60.
On-and-off labour stoppages since April have forced Lufthansa and its subsidiary airlines to cancel 6,000 flights.

Paris (Alliance News) - Air France pilots backed the expansion of the airline's low-cost subsidiary despite staging 
their longest strike over the development of Transavia in September, their union said Wednesday.
More than four-fifths of the pilots took part in the vote, and of those, 53% voted in favour of an expansion, the 
largest of Air France's pilots unions, SNPL, said.
The pilots walked off their jobs for two weeks in September and cost Air France-KLM about 500 million euros (622 
million dollars). The strike ended under pressure from the government without an agreement on a new pay deal for 
Transavia pilots.
Air France said it needs to reduce crew costs to make Transavia into a competitor with the likes of Ryanair and 
Easyjet.
The proposal before the pilots this week included whether to expand Transavia's fleet from 14 to 40 planes.

UPDATE: Boeing Finalizes Order For 100 737 MAX 200s With Ryanair

CHICAGO (Alliance News) - Aerospace giant Boeing, Inc finalized Monday an order for 100 737 MAX 200 aircraft 
from low-cost Irish airline Ryanair Holdings PLC that is valued at USD11 billion at current list prices. The order, 
which includes options for 100 additional 737 MAX 200 airplanes, was initially committed in September.
Ryanair is the launch customer for the 737 MAX 200 aircraft that is the newest member of the 737 MAX family, 
which has 11 additional seats that will lead to a total seating of up to 200.
"These new 'gamechanger' aircraft will allow Ryanair to lower our costs and airfares, while improving our customer 
experience with more leg room and the Boeing Sky Interior, as we roll out new offers, particularly for our Business 
Plus and Family Extra customers," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
The new aircraft order will enable Ryanair to expand its fleet to about 520 aircraft by 2024 and create another 
10,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers in Europe. It will also boost its traffic to over 150 million by 
2024 from the 82 million passengers last year.
Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, said the aircraft variant will enable it to grow at many more of 
Europe's primary airports even as many of Europe's flag carriers cut capacity on short haul routes.
The airline currently operates an all-Boeing fleet of more than 300 next-generation 737-800s. It took delivery of its 
first 737 in 1994. This will be Ryanair's first order for the 737 MAX family aircrafts.
Ryanair had last year finalized an order for 175 current generation 737-800s, which will expand Ryanair's fleet to 
more than 400 737-800s.
Ryanair describes itself as Europe's favorite low fares airline, operating more than 1,600 daily flights connecting 
186 destinations in 30 countries.
UPDATE: Boeing Finalizes Order For 100 737 MAX 200s With Ryanair
Boeing's 737 MAX, the top selling narrow-body single-aisle planes, competes with the A320neo's manufactured by 
Boeing's European rival Airbus Group N.V.. The 737 MAX is a new-engine variant of the world's best selling Boeing 
737 airplane and builds on the strengths of Next-Generation 737.
Boeing's 737 MAX family of aircrafts are powered with the latest-technology LEAP-1B engines from CFM 
International, a joint venture of General Electric Co. and Safran SA. Meanwhile, the A320neos offer a choice of 
engines either from CFM or Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp.
Chicago, Illinois-based Boeing, which breached the 2000 mark for orders for 737 MAXs in May 2014, said its orders 
for the 737 MAX currently stand at 2,550 from more than 50 customers.
The unprecedented demand for 737 MAXs is fueled by air traffic growth and the need for more fuel-efficient 
airplanes. The aircraft has been quite popular due to its 14% more fuel efficiency and lowest operating costs with an 
eight percent operating cost per seat advantage over tomorrow's competition.
The 737 MAX 200 will further improve operating costs by about 5% as it will accommodate an additional 11 seats, 
increasing revenue potential and providing customers up to 20% better fuel efficiency per seat than today's most 
efficient single-aisle airplanes.
"The 737 MAX 200 will be a excellent addition to Ryanair's all-Boeing fleet, providing the additional capacity, 
improved economics and high-levels of reliability that are required for its continued expansion," said Todd Nelp, 
vice president of European Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
Boeing said the fast growing low-cost sector is forecasted to account for 35% of single-aisle airline capacity by 
2033.
BA closed Friday's regular trading session at USD134.36, up USD0.85 on a volume of 2.09 million shares.

LONDON (Alliance News) - In a wide-ranging re-rating of the transport sector, UBS downgrades International 
Consolidated Airlines Group to Neutral from Buy as the share price approaches its 495 pence price target, but says 
it retains confidence in the IAG management team who have turned around two of the airline brands and continue 
to drive further restructuring. 
The bank says the shares could still continue upwards if earnings benefit from a stronger than expected 
macroecomnomic backdrop, capacity leaves the industry or the oil price drops further, coupled with capacity 
discipline. It increases it full-year 2016 earnings per share forecast to 80 euro cents from 72 cents to account for 
lower oil prices, noting hedging will mitigate some benefits in 2015.
In its sector reassessment, UBS forecasts low, slow growth in transport and prefers stocks with relatively low 
expectations or solid reasons for future growth, not just based upon a cyclical recovery. 
The bank upgrades Deutsche Lufthansa to Buy from Neutral to match easyJet and Ryanair in airlines, prefers 
Germany's Fraport and France's Eurotunnel in infrastructure, Deutsche Post-DHL in logistics, PostNL in postal and 
National Express in Bus and Rail. It downgrades Belgium's bpost and Zurich Airport to Neutral from Buy.
In afternoon trade, IAG shares are down 0.2% at 456.8p.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said its shareholders have given approval for the 
company to move ahead with the purchase of 200 Boeing 737 MAX jets.

When finalised, the deal will be valued at more than USD22 billion at current list prices, the Irish company said.
Ryanair said the new aircraft will cut its unit costs and that it would pass on the savings in the form of lower fares for 
customers. By the end of the delivery stream for the aircraft, Ryanair forecasts its passenger numbers will increase 
from 82 million in 2014 to more than 150 million by around 2024.
Ryanair shares were up 2.6% to 8.988 pence on Friday.

Luxembourg (Alliance News) - The European Commission should have investigated whether an Irish tax on air 
travel is in breach of EU law, a court ruled Tuesday, following a complaint by low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings 
PLC.
The EU's executive is responsible for ensuring that member states don't hamper with free market competition 
through measures that benefit certain companies, but not others.
In 2009, Ireland introduced an air travel tax, but exempted passengers travelling on to another destination.
Ryanair complained at the time that the system favoured Irish carriers Aer Lingus Group PLC and Aer Arann, as 
they had comparatively more transit and transfer passengers than the low-cost airline.
It also argued that the flat-rate fee - 3 euros (3.84 dollars) per departure - made up a higher proportion of the ticket 
price for low-cost carriers than for traditional airlines.
But the commission dismissed the concerns in 2011, arguing that the tax was not selective. Ryanair disagreed, and 
brought the issue to the EU's General Court.
The Luxembourg-based judges partially backed Ryanair's complaint, and said the commission should have 
launched a formal investigation into the Irish tax.
They argued that the commission's examination had been "incomplete and insufficient," pointing to 
"inconsistencies" between its decision and a letter sent by the Irish authorities about the tax exemption.
The commission's preliminary inquiry into the measure also took longer than normal, indicating that it had 
"encountered serious difficulties" that would have merited a full investigation, the court found.
The decision can be appealed before the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Thursday welcomed an Irish Supreme Court Ruling that legal 
cases taken by it against so called 'screenscraper' websites must be heard in Ireland.
Screenscraper sites sell Ryanair flights without transferring the customer to the Ryanair website at any stage of the 
process. Ryanair has been engaged in cases across Europe, it said, to "prevent customers from being subjected to 
excessive charges and poor travel experiences as they didn't book directly."
Ryanair said it has called on such sites to stop "misleading customers" with artificially low prices that are not related 
to the total amount the customer ends up paying.
"The ruling will have no impact on the authorised websites we work with today, over a dozen, who are supplied with 
Ryanair's product inventory, so as to allow customers to compare airfares," said Chief Marketing Officer Kenny 
Jacobs in a statement.  
Shares in Ryanair closed up 0.10% at 8.39 pence.

IAG Plans For Start Of Dividend Payments, As October Traffic Rises

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group Friday said it expects to meet its financial 
targets in 2015 and is considering introducing a long-term dividend plan for shareholders, as it reported a rise in 
October traffic.
"The company has made significant progress during 2014 and we remain confident in meeting our 2015 financial 
targets which we see as the trigger to introducing a dividend," the company said in a statement ahead of its Capital 
Markets Day later Friday.
The company, owner of British Airways and Spainish airlines Iberia and Vueling, said the initial dividend would be 
based on a payout ratio of 25% of underlying profit after tax.
IAG's announcement comes days after Irish airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Aer Lingus Group PLC raised their 
forecasts for the current financial year, after reporting growth in profit and revenue in the first half, driven by higher 
passenger numbers, average fares and lower fuel costs.
The move to introduce dividends comes after IAG spent recent years turning round its Iberia operations, which were 
loss-making due to a big cost bill and unprofitable routes. The airline is now streamlined, and costs have been 
reduced.
Outlining long-term planning goals for 2016-2020, IAG said it is aiming for an operating profit margin of between 
10% and 14%, underlying operating profit of around EUR5 billion a year and annual capital spending of between 
EUR2 billion and EUR3 billion.
The company said October traffic increased 7.5% on the year in revenue passenger kilometres, and passenger 
numbers rose 10.3% to 6.9 million as its load factor remained steady at 81%.
Vueling, its lower-cost Spanish airline, reported a 27% rise in RPK, Iberia rose 6% and British Airways increased 
5.4%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Aer Lingus Group PLC Wednesday raised its full-year guidance as it reported a rise in 
operating profit in the third quarter, boosted by a robust short-haul performance and an expansion of long-haul 
flights.
The Irish airline said it expects full-year operating profit before exceptional items to be above the EUR61.1 million 
recorded in 2013, despite a larger expected loss in the final quarter of the year because of fleet costs.
The raised guidance comes just two days after rival Irish airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost 
carrier, raised its guidance for the current financial year, after reporting strong growth in profit and revenue in the 
first half, driven by higher passenger numbers, average fares and lower fuel costs.
Aer Lingus' profit before exceptional items rose to EUR112.9 million in the three months to September 30, from 
EUR94.9 million a year earlier despite higher fuel and staff costs. Revenue climbed to EUR531.1 million from 
EUR466.3 million as short-haul revenue rose 5.5% and long-haul 34%.
"Our quarterly operating result of EUR112.9 million, representing an operating margin of 21.3%, is 19.0% above 
prior year and is our highest Q3 operating result since the financial crisis," said Chief Executive Christoph Mueller.
Fuel costs increased 10% to EUR114.3 million, reflecting higher volumes offset in part by lower prices, while staff 
costs increased 5.5% to EUR76.1 million.
The airline reported 1.5% increase in October passenger numbers as a 29% rise in long-haul passengers offset a 
2.1% drop in short-haul. Revenue passenger kilometres, a measure of profitability, rose 11.4% in the month. 
Still, Aer Lingus shares were down 0.3% at EUR1.51 Wednesday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Monday raised its guidance for the current financial year, after 
reporting strong growth in profit and revenue in the first half, driven by higher passenger numbers, average fares 
and lower fuel costs.
Europe's largest low-cost airline reported a net profit of EUR795 million for the six months to September 30, up from 
EUR602 million a year earlier, as revenue grew to EUR3.54 billion, from EUR3.26 billion.
It said it now expects profit for the full year to be between EUR750 million to EUR770 million, up from its previous 
guidance of EUR650 million, although it cautioned that this will depend on booking strength in the third and fourth 
quarters, where it currently has little visibility.
The Irish airline flew 51.4 million passengers in the first half, up from 49.2 million a year earlier, while average fares 
rose 5% to EUR54. Its unit costs fell by 25, although they were up 3% excluding fuel.
Ryanair now expects traffic to grow 12% on the year in the third quarter, and 20% in the fourth quarter. 
"We believe it is time to capitalise upon the many opportunities available to us at both primary and 4 secondary 
airports, to grow our route network and increase frequencies, in order to attract business traffic which tends to travel 
more during the winter period," it said in a statement.
It now expects full year traffic to grow by 9% to 89 million customers, and average fares for the year to rise by just 
1% to EUR47. It expects unit costs for the year to be flat. 
It has also revised its medium-term traffic guidance higher, and now expects to double to 150 million customers a 
year by 2024.
The airline attributed some of the increase in passenger numbers to its recent decision to introduce a business 
traveller package and to improve its customer service. It had admitted that it was too tough and uncompromising 
with passengers previously and has set out to soften its stance.
UPDATE: Ryanair Raises Guidance After Strong First Half
"While partially due to the presence of Easter in the first quarter and a weak prior year comparable, we have also 
enjoyed a strong summer thanks to our strategy, of raising forward bookings and improving our customer 
experience which has delivered higher load factors and yields," it said.
It said forward bookings for December to March are continuing to run 5% on average ahead of this time last year.
Ryanair also said it has taken advantage of the recent fall in oil prices to extend its fuel price hedging. It is now 
hedged for 90% of its fiscal 2016 fuel needs at about USD93 a barrel. It said this would result in a 2% reduction in 
unit fuel costs in euro terms over the next 12 months.
"We will now look for opportunities to extend our fuel hedging programme into FY17 to lock in future cost savings," 
it said.
The airline has also extended its capital expenditure programme to September 2017 at an average exchange rate 
of €/$1.35,  "which locks in substantially lower costs for the new aircraft deliveries", it said.      
Ryanair shares were up 8.9% at EUR8.27 in London Monday morning. Rival easyJet PLC was also up 2.7% at 
1,540.00 pence, the best-performing stock on the FTSE 100.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The airlines are some of the best performing stocks Monday after Ireland's low-cost 
carrier Ryanair released second quarter results that were broadly in line with expectations, but significantly raised 
its full-year guidance.
Ryanair shares opened significantly higher, quoted up 8.5% at EUR8.264. Fellow low-cost airline easyJet leads the 
FTSE 100 gainers, up 2.6% at 1,539.40p. British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines is up 1.3% at 
414.7p.
Ryanair reported a net profit of EUR795 million for the six months to September 30, up from EUR602 million a year 
earlier, as revenue grew to EUR3.54 billion, from EUR3.26 billion.
Liberum Capital analyst Gerald Khoo says the reported numbers are in line with the market's expectation, but 
investors will be most interested in the full-year guidance, which is 17% above the current market consensus.
The Irish airline said it now expects profit for the full year to be between EUR750 million to EUR770 million, up from 
its previous guidance of EUR650 million, although it cautioned that this will depend on booking strength in the third 
and fourth quarters, for which it currently has little visibility.
Liberum expects consensus earnings forecasts to rise as a result of Monday's update, and reiterates a Buy 
recommendation, along with a price target of EUR8.50.
Ryanair in part credited the improved performance to its recent strategy shift, which has included improving the

Cantor Fitzgerald says that Ryanair's recent strategy shift of lifting customer service quality is "paying-off 
handsomely". The brokerage also reiterates a Buy rating on the stock, with a price target of EUR9.0.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Standard Chartered's management team Monday received the backing of the bank's 
second-largest shareholder, Aberdeen Asset Management, whose Chief Executive Martin Gilbert called on his 
counterpart Peter Sands to "address the bank's current issues and deal with them now".
Gilbert's support eases the pressure on Standard Chartered CEO Sands and Chairman John Peace, who have 
endured a difficult year at the helm of the emerging markets focused bank. Just last week, Standard Chartered 
reported a 16% drop in third-quarter pretax profit and cut its guidance for the second half of the year.
"We don't believe there is anything fundamentally wrong with the bank and we are looking forward to hearing details 
of the turnaround plans at the investor conference in Hong Kong in two weeks' time," Gilbert said in a statement.
Gilbert's comments come after the Financial Times reported late last week that non-executive directors at Standard 
Chartered are intending to meet with the bank's chairman to discuss a succession plan to replace Sands this week. 
Some of the biggest shareholders in the bank have either told or plan to tell Peace that he should accelerate a plan 
to replace Sands, the FT said, citing two people familiar with the discussions.
The news comes as the UK's largest listed bank, HSBC Holdings, reported a rise in third-quarter pretax profit, 
despite a jump in operating expenses due to more than a billion pounds' worth of charges and provisions for 
matters including UK customer redress and UK regulators' investigations into alleged manipulation of the foreign 
exchange market.
It made a USD4.61 billion pretax profit in the quarter ended September 30, compared with USD4.53 billion in the 
corresponding period last year, despite booking USD701 million in provisions for UK customer redress, including a 
further USD589 million for possible mis-selling in previous years of payment protection insurance policies. It also 
booked a charge of USD378 million relating to the "estimated liability" in connection with the ongoing foreign 
exchange investigation by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, as well as a USD550 million charge under a

securities in the years leading up to the financial crisis.
Ryanair Holdings' shares have shot higher in London, after Europe's largest low-cost carrier raised its guidance for 
the current financial year, after reporting strong growth in profit and revenue in the first half, driven by higher 
passenger numbers, average fares and lower fuel costs.
The airline attributed some of the increase in passenger numbers to its recent decision to introduce a business 
traveller package and to improve its customer service. It had admitted that it was too tough and uncompromising 
with passengers previously and has set out to soften its stance.
"While partially due to the presence of Easter in the first quarter and a weak prior year comparable, we have also 
enjoyed a strong summer thanks to our strategy, of raising forward bookings and improving our customer 
experience which has delivered higher load factors and yields," it said.
The Ryanair update also gave rival easyJet a boost, with its shares the best-performing on the FTSE 100 Monday.

Markets: UK stocks indices, along with major European markets, have slowly lost ground over the morning as 
disappointing PMI data from both China and across the eurozone have put an end to the rally sparked late last 
week when the Bank of Japan unexpectedly announced extra monetary stimulus. The FTSE 100 is outperforming 
its European counterparts, however, on the back of a more healthy UK manufacturing sector.
Futures indicate a slightly lower start on Wall Street, with the DJIA, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all set to open 
down about 0.1%.

shows, increasing its efficiency and effectiveness through the consistent use of standardised systems, and focusing

Betfair Group said revenue rose in the second-quarter, boosted by an increase in customer numbers after a strong 
World Cup. The online bookmaker said revenue in the three months to October 31 rose 22% to GBP119 million,

2014, while the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margin remains "strong" at 46.9%. It 
expects the margin, which was in line with the first half of the year, to stay at a similar level for the final quarter. 
However, its revenue guidance at actual exchange rates was between GBP355 million and GBP362 million, but is 
now between GBP343 million and GBP250 million based on at exchange rates on October 31.

contract increased since the contract was first announced last month. Touchstone Gold is down after it said it is in 
late-stage talks over a possible investment in a technology company, which it will fund from existing cash 
resources. Touchstone did not provide any financial details on the potential deal, nor define the target. Dart Group 
is also down after it set aside GBP17 million in the current financial year to cover potential historical claims related 
to a claim for compensation after one of its Jet2.com aircraft was delayed by a technical hitch, and said it is facing 
costs of between GBP3 million and GBP5 million a year in future years. The news comes after the Supreme Court 
rejected Jet2.com's appeal of an earlier decision made by the Court of Appeal.

Top Economics And General
----------
UK manufacturing sector growth quickened more than expected in October to its fastest pace in three months, 
survey results from Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Logistics, or CIPS, showed. 
The seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers' index, or PMI, rose to a three month 
high of 53.2 in October from the seventeen month low of 51.5 in September. Economists had expected the index to 
come in at 51.5. This marked the twentieth successive month of expansion in manufacturing activity. A reading 
above 50 signals expansion.
----------
The Eurozone manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose slightly less than initially estimated in October, final 
data from Markit Economics showed. The final PMI rose to 50.6 in October from September's 14-month low of 50.3. 
The flash score was 50.7. The current sequence above the no-change level was extended to 16 months. The sector 
remained in a state of near-stagnation as weak demand continued to restrict growth of both output and employment 
across the currency union.
----------
China's non-manufacturing business activity expanded at a slower rate in October, data from the National Bureau of 
Statistics showed. The non-manufacturing business activity index decreased to 53.8 in October from 54 in 
September. This indicated a slower rate of growth.
----------
China's manufacturing sector continued to expand as expected in October, the results of a survey by Markit 
Economics and HSBC Bank showed. The HSBC manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 50.4 in 
October, confirming the flash estimate and the expectations of economists. This was slightly higher than 50.2 in 
September.
----------
Ireland's manufacturing sector growth gathered momentum in October, data from Markit Economics showed. The 
seasonally adjusted Investec Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 56.6 from 55.7 in September. The reading 
signalled substantial strengthening of business conditions. Manufacturing production increased at a faster pace with 
panellists attributing the latest growth in output to higher new orders and stock building efforts.
----------
Prime Minister David Cameron's pledge to curb the number of migrants entering Britain from the EU could lead 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel to drop her efforts to keep Britain in the bloc, a report said Sunday. Merkel 
warned Cameron on the sidelines of the EU summit in October that he was reaching a "point of no return" by 
persisting in his plan to introduce quotas for EU migrants, Der Spiegel magazine reported, citing anonymous 
government officials. Merkel reportedly told Cameron that if he follows through with the measure, "That's it."
----------
The leaders of the pro-Russian separatist movements in eastern Ukraine were declared the elected "heads" of the 
Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic after winning disputed elections. Alexander 
Zakharchenko won 78.93% of 1.01 million votes cast in Donetsk, while Igor Plotnitsky received 63.8% of the almost 
699,000 votes cast in neighbouring Luhansk, Interfax quoted local election chiefs as saying. The Ukrainian 
government in Kiev, the EU and the US have all called the elections illegal, with EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica 
Mogherini arguing in a statement that they "put a new obstacle on the path towards peace in Ukraine." The Russian 
Foreign Ministry, by contrast, said that it respects the result.

At least 200 members of a pro-government Sunni tribe have been executed by the Islamic State militant group in 
the western Iraqi province of Anbar over the course of three days, security and local officials said on Sunday. 
Beginning Thursday, the executions took place in separate incidents and targeted tribesmen from the al-Bu Nimr 
tribe in Anbar, a security official told dpa.
----------
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday urged calm after weeks of unrest in Jerusalem and pledged 
to keep in place long-standing prayer divisions at a flashpoint Muslim-Jewish holy site in the disputed city. Tensions 
culminated last week after a Palestinian shot and critically wounded a far-right Jewish activist who had advocated 
that Jews be allowed to pray at the Temple Mount, known to Muslims as the Holy Sanctuary. Israeli police shot the 
Palestinian gunman dead in a shoot-out in East Jerusalem.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are amongst the biggest risers and fallers within the main London 
indices midday Monday.
-------
FTSE 100 WINNERS

EasyJet, up 2.4% and International Consolidated Airlines Group, up 0.4%. The airlines are up after Irish peer 
Ryanair Holdings raised its guidance for the current financial year, after reporting strong growth in profit and 
revenue in the first half, driven by higher passenger numbers, average fares and lower fuel costs.
Standard Chartered, up 0.6%. Non-executive directors at the Asia-focused bank are intending to meet with the 
bank's chairman to discuss a succession plan to replace Chief Executive Peter Sands next week, the Financial 
Times reported on Friday. Some of the biggest shareholders in the bank have either told or plan to tell Chairman 
John Peace that he would accelerate a plan to replace Sands, the FT said, citing two people familiar with the 
discussions. However, Standard Chartered's management team received the backing of the bank's second-largest 
shareholder, Aberdeen Asset Management, whose Chief Executive Martin Gilbert called on his counterpart Sands 
to "address the bank's current issues and deal with them now".
Carnival, up 0.4%. The cruise company unveiled the cruise industry's first-of-its-kind hybrid wireless network, an 
enhanced high-speed service to eventually be rolled out to all 101 of its ships on all nine of its brands. According to 
the company, this technology innovation is expected to revolutionise how millions of its passengers stay in touch 
during their cruise and generate even greater interest in cruise vacations, especially among the tech-savvy 
millennial generation.

Royal Bank of Scotland Group, down 1.8%. Investec has cut the bank's rating to Sell from Hold, and raised its price 
target to 370.00 pence from 360.00p, saying that there are short-term selling opportunities on the stock. RBS 
currently trades at 382.28p.
HSBC Holdings, down 1.7%. The largest London-listed bank, by market capitalisation, reported a rise in pretax 
profit in the third quarter, but also joined peers in reporting large provisions for matters including UK customer 
redress and regulatory investigations into alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market. HSBC said it made 
a USD4.61 billion pretax profit in the third quarter, compared with USD4.53 billion last year. However, operating 
expenses increased to USD11.09 billion from, USD9.58 billion, as it set aside USD701 million in provisions for UK 
customer redress, including a further USD589 million for possible mis-selling in previous years of payment 
protection insurance policies. The bank also took a charge of USD378 million relating to the "estimated liability" in 
connection with the ongoing foreign exchange investigation by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, following similar 
moves by US and UK peers.

FTSE 250 WINNERS
------- 
Ophir Energy, up 3.9%. The company confirmed it is in talks with Salamander Energy about a possible all-share 
takeover deal for the South-Asia exploration and production company after an initial approach last month. Ophir 
said the combined company would have a strong balance sheet, with operations in both Africa and South East Asia, 
and would be well-placed to strengthen exploration of Salamander's BlockG4/50 in Thailand and other Ophir assets 
in Myanmar and Indonesia. A combined company would have production, development and exploration exposure to 
21 blocks in South East Asia, Ophir said.
Betfair Group, up 3.1%. The online bookmaker said revenue in the three months to October 31 rose 22% to 
GBP119 million, and revenue was up 13% when normalised for unusually high gross win margins. The period was

agreement with European Uranium to earn in on two uranium projects in the Slovak Republic. 
Rangers International Football Club, up 12%. The Scottish football club has appointed Derek Llambias to its board 
as a non-executive director, the latest change at the top since Sports Direct International founder Mike Ashley 
started building his stake in the club. Llambias, who has been working as a consultant to the Rangers board since 
Tuesday last week, is the former managing director of Newcastle Football Club, which is itself owned by Ashley. 
Llambias is a long-time friend and associate of Ashley.
Kodal Minerals, up 10%. The company said it has found high-grade copper at the upper mine in the Grimeli 
prospect in Norway. The highest grade result from a series of underground channel samples taken from the upper 
mine returned a grade of 7.24% copper over 1.74 metres, it said. Kodal said it is now planning to start a drill 
programme to explore the areas to the east, west and below the current sampled area.
Kea Petroleum, up 10%. The company said its pretax loss narrowed significantly in its most recent financial year on 
the back of a jump in revenue and much lower writedowns on exploration assets. Kea's pretax loss for the year to 
May 31 was GBP3.8 million, reduced from the GBP9.3 million loss posted last year. The loss in 2013 was pushed 
higher by the GBP7.2 million writedown the company took on exploration assets, a number which fell to only

GBP1.6 million this year. Revenue for the company was up to GBP2.1 million from GBP829,000 a year earlier on

CloudBuy, up 7.6%. The cloud e-commerce company said it has signed a three-year contract with an unnamed

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - European markets were lower Monday, with French stocks turning in a 
particularly poor performance amid anxiety about the global economy.
Investors booked profits from last week gains on the back of the Bank of Japan's increased stimulus.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks dropped 1%, and is down 0.86% year-to-date. The German 
DAX lost 0.81%, the French CAC 40 slipped 0.92% and the FTSE 100 index of the UK fell 0.89%.
In Paris, Publicis Groupe lost 2.2%. The advertising group reported a definitive agreement to acquire US-based 
technology consulting company Sapient Corp. for USD3.7 billion in cash.
Meanwhile, Technip gained 1%. The oilfield services provider received a contract from South Africa-based Sasol 
Limited to provide engineering and procurement for eight proprietary Ultra Selective Conversion furnaces.
HSBC fell 1.8%. The lender posted increased quarterly profit, but added that discussions are in progress with the 
UK FCA regarding a proposed resolution of their foreign exchange investigation, which is likely to involve the 
payment of a significant financial penalty.
Ryanair rose 7.6% after the Irish low-cost airline reported increased first-half profit, and lifted its full-year outlook yet 
again. EasyJet and International Consolidated Airlines also advanced notably.
Holcim fell 2.6% in Zurich. The cement maker posted third-quarter net income and revenue that missed analysts' 
projections.
France-based cable and telecommunications provider Altice SA, which trades on Amsterdam, announced that it has 
made a binding, fully financed offer to purchase the Portuguese assets of Portugal Telecom from Brazilian wireless 
carrier Oi S.A.

European Stocks Decline On Profit-taking
In economic news, the eurozone's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose slightly less than initially 
estimated in October.
Final data from Markit Economics showed the final PMI rose to 50.6 in October from September's 14-month low of 
50.3. The flash score was 50.7.
Separate data showed that Germany's manufacturing sector returned to growth zone in October. The Markit/BME 
PMI rose to 51.4 in October from a 15-month low of 49.9 in September. Nonetheless, the score was slightly below 
the flash estimate of 51.8.
The French manufacturing sector continued to contract in October but the pace of decline was slower than initially 
estimated. The headline seasonally adjusted PMI fell to 48.5 in October from 48.8 in September. The flash score for 
October was at 47.3.
UK manufacturing sector growth quickened more than expected in October to its fastest pace in three months. The 
seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI rose to a three month high of 53.2 in October from the 
seventeen month low of 51.5 in September. Economists had expected the index to come in at 51.5.
Meanwhile, China's official manufacturing PMI dropped to a 5-month low of 50.8 in October, data released last 
Saturday showed, reinforcing concerns about a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
While growth in the services sector hit a nine-month low in October, a private gauge of manufacturing activity 
compiled by HSBC rose modestly in the month after holding steady in September.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
HSBC Holdings reported a rise in third-quarter pretax profit, despite a jump in operating expenses due to more than 
a billion pounds' worth of charges and provisions for matters including UK customer redress and UK regulators' 
investigations into alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market. In a statement, HSBC said it made a 
USD4.61 billion pretax profit in the quarter ended September 30, compared with USD4.53 billion in the 
corresponding period last year. Revenue rose to USD15.78 billion from USD15.08 billion, while loan impairment 
charges and other credit risk provisions, fell to USD760 million from USD1.59 billion. However, operating expenses 
increased to USD11.09 billion from, USD9.58 billion, as it set aside USD701 million in provisions for UK customer 
redress.
----------
Ryanair Holdings raised its guidance for the current financial year, after reporting strong growth in profit and 
revenue in the first half, driven by higher passenger numbers, average fares and lower fuel costs. Europe's largest 
low-cost airline reported a net profit of EUR795 million for the six months to September 30, up from EUR602 million 
a year earlier, as revenue grew to EUR3.54 billion, from EUR3.26 billion. It said it now expects profit for the full year 
to be between EUR750 million to EUR770 million, up from its previous guidance of EUR650 million, although it 
cautioned that this will depend on booking strength in the third and fourth quarters, where it currently has little 
visibility.
----------
Diageo said it has agreed a deal to buy Don Julio tequila while selling Bushmills Irish whiskey, strengthening its 
presence in Mexico. Diageo is buying the tequila brand from Casa Cuervo, which will also end the production and 
distribution of Smirnoff vodka in Mexico. In return, Jose Cuervo Overseas is buying Bushmills. The transaction will 
yield USD408 million to Diageo when completed, expected in early 2015 subject to approval. The transaction is

expected to break even after three years and Diageo said the proceeds will be used to reduce the company's debt. 
It expects a dilution in earnings per share of 0.6% in the year to end-June 2015.
----------
Denmark-based biotechnology company Genmab said that it has entered into an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline 
and Novartis Pharma to transfer the ofatumumab collaboration with GSK to Novartis. The transfer of the 
collaboration follows an April 2014 announcement in which Novartis, as part of a definitive agreement reached with 
GSK, agreed to acquire GSK's oncology products including ofatumumab (the GSK/Novartis Transaction).

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK manufacturing sector growth quickened more than expected in October to its fastest pace in three months, 
survey results from Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Logistics, or CIPS, showed. 
The seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers' index, or PMI, rose to a three month 
high of 53.2 in October from the seventeen month low of 51.5 in September. Economists had expected the index to 
TOP NEWS: UK Manufacturing Index Rises As Eurozone Disappoints
come in at 51.5. This marked the twentieth successive month of expansion in manufacturing activity. A reading 
above 50 signals expansion.
----------
Eurozone's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose slightly less than initially estimated in October, final 
data from Markit Economics showed. The final PMI rose to 50.6 in October from September's 14-month low of 50.3. 
The flash score was 50.7. The current sequence above the no-change level was extended to 16 months. The sector 
remained in a state of near-stagnation as weak demand continued to restrict growth of both output and employment 
across the currency union.
----------
China's non-manufacturing business activity expanded at a slower rate in October, data from the National Bureau of 
Statistics showed. The non-manufacturing business activity index decreased to 53.8 in October from 54 in 
September. This indicated a slower rate of growth.
----------
China's manufacturing sector continued to expand as expected in October, the results of a survey by Markit 
Economics and HSBC Bank showed. The HSBC manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 50.4 in 
October, confirming the flash estimate and the expectations of economists. This was slightly higher than 50.2 in 
September.
----------
Ireland's manufacturing sector growth gathered momentum in October, data from Markit Economics showed. The 
seasonally adjusted Investec Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 56.6 from 55.7 in September. The reading 
signalled substantial strengthening of business conditions. Manufacturing production increased at a faster pace with 
panellists attributing the latest growth in output to higher new orders and stock building efforts.
----------
Prime Minister David Cameron's pledge to curb the number of migrants entering Britain from the EU could lead 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel to drop her efforts to keep Britain in the bloc, a report said Sunday. Merkel 
warned Cameron on the sidelines of the EU summit in October that he was reaching a "point of no return" by 
persisting in his plan to introduce quotas for EU migrants, Der Spiegel magazine reported, citing anonymous 
government officials. Merkel reportedly told Cameron that if he follows through with the measure, "That's it."
----------
The leaders of the pro-Russian separatist movements in eastern Ukraine were declared the elected "heads" of the 
Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic after winning disputed elections. Alexander 
Zakharchenko won 78.93% of 1.01 million votes cast in Donetsk, while Igor Plotnitsky received 63.8% of the almost 
699,000 votes cast in neighbouring Luhansk, Interfax quoted local election chiefs as saying. The Ukrainian 
government in Kiev, the EU and the US have all called the elections illegal, with EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica 
Mogherini arguing in a statement that they "put a new obstacle on the path towards peace in Ukraine." The Russian 
Foreign Ministry, by contrast, said that it respects the result.
----------
At least 200 members of a pro-government Sunni tribe have been executed by the Islamic State militant group in 
the western Iraqi province of Anbar over the course of three days, security and local officials said on Sunday. 
Beginning Thursday, the executions took place in separate incidents and targeted tribesmen from the al-Bu Nimr 
tribe in Anbar, a security official told dpa.
----------
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday urged calm after weeks of unrest in Jerusalem and pledged 
to keep in place long-standing prayer divisions at a flashpoint Muslim-Jewish holy site in the disputed city. Tensions 
culminated last week after a Palestinian shot and critically wounded a far-right Jewish activist who had advocated 
that Jews be allowed to pray at the Temple Mount, known to Muslims as the Holy Sanctuary. Israeli police shot the 
Palestinian gunman dead in a shoot-out in East Jerusalem.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has been ordered to pay EUR8.1 million in damages and 
EUR200,000 in fines for breaching French labour laws, the BBC reported on Tuesday.
The low-cost carrier was found guilty by a court in Aix-en-Provence of paying workers under Irish contracts in order 
to avoid making French social security payments, the BBC said.
The case involves staff employed by Ryanair at Marseille airport between 2007 and 2010. The airline contested the 
original ruling, but lost its appeal.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost Irish airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Friday that Chief Executive Officer 
Michael O'Leary has signed a new five-year contract, committing him to the company until September 2019.
The new contract replaces O'Leary's rolling 12 month contract.
O'Leary has been CEO of the airline since Ryanair first floated back in 1997. 
"During that time, Ryanair's annual traffic has grown from 3 million to over 80 million customers per annum," the 
company said in a statement.
The company also said that O'Leary has been granted options over five million shares, payable at current market 
prices. 
"However these options will only vest if the airline delivers exceptional performance targets over the next five years, 
which have been set by the Remuneration Committee," it said.
Ryanair said it expects to grow traffic over the next five years by 50% to over 120 million customers by 2019, from 
81 million customers last year.
Ryanair shares were trading 1.1% lower just before the market close Friday at EUR7.29.

CHICAGO (Alliance News) - Aerospace and defense giant Boeing Co on Wednesday reported an 18% increase in 
profit for the third quarter from last year on higher revenues, reflecting strong demand for commercial aircraft.
Both revenues and adjusted earnings per share for the quarter beat analysts' expectations. Looking ahead to fiscal 
2014, Boeing once again raised its earnings outlook, while reaffirming its revenue expectations.
Jim McNerney, Boeing Chairman and CEO, said, "Continued strong operating performance across our production 
and services businesses drove significant growth in earnings-per-share, and enabled us to continue to capture new 
business, pushing our order backlog to a record USD490 billion."
McNerney added, "We added net new orders for 501 commercial airplanes, launched the high-capacity 737 MAX 
200, captured a NASA contract for the Commercial Crew program, and returned USD1.5 billion to shareholders 
through dividends and share repurchases."
The Chicago, Illinois-based company reported net income for the third quarter of USD1.36 billion or USD1.86 per 
share, up from USD1.16 billion or USD1.51 per share in the prior-year quarter.
Excluding items, core earnings for the quarter were USD2.14 per share, compared with USD1.80 per share in the 
year-ago period. On average, 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report earnings of 
USD1.98 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.
Total revenues for the quarter grew 7% to USD23.78 billion from USD22.13 billion in the same quarter last year, 
and beat analysts' consensus estimate of USD23.02 billion. The increase in revenues reflect higher deliveries.
Operating margin for the quarter edged up 0.8 percentage points to 8.9%.
Segment-wise, Boeing Commercial Airplanes revenue for the quarter increased 15% from last year to USD16.11 
billion, on higher deliveries of aircraft. Commercial airplanes deliveries for the quarter increased 9% from the year-
ago period to 186.
UPDATE: Boeing Third Quarter Profit Up 18%, Results Beat View
During the quarter, Boeing launched the 737 MAX 200 with a commitment from Ryanair for 100 airplanes. The 737 
program has won nearly 2,300 firm orders for the 737 MAX since launch.
Due to continued strong demand, Boeing intends to increase the 737 production rate from 42 to 47 per month in 
2017, with recently announced plans to increase to 52 per month in 2018. Also during the quarter, Boeing delivered 
the first GEnx-powered 787-9 Dreamliner.
The Commercial Airplanes segment booked 501 net orders during the quarter. The division had a backlog of over 
5,500 airplanes, valued at a record USD430 billion.
In the Boeing Defense, Space & Security segment, total revenues declined 2% from last year to USD7.91 billion, 
with revenues from Network & Space Systems decreasing 9%. Boeing Military Aircraft revenues rose 3%, reflecting 
higher P-8 deliveries.
Backlog at Defense, Space & Security was USD60 billion, of which 37% represents orders with international 
customers.
Total company backlog of USD490 billion at quarter-end rose from USD440.3 billion at the beginning of the quarter, 
and includes USD73 billion of net orders during the quarter.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2014, Boeing once again raised its outlook for core earnings to a range of USD8.10 to 
USD8.30 per share from the prior range of USD7.90 to USD8.10 per share, citing its strong operating performance.
The company also raised its outlook for full-year reported earnings to a range of USD6.90 to USD7.10 per share 
from the prior range of USD6.85 to USD7.05 per share.
However, Boeing reaffirmed its outlook for full-year revenue in a range of USD87.5 billion to USD90.5 billion.
Street expects the company to report earnings of USD8.28 per share for the year on revenues of USD89.60 billion.
Boeing continues to project commercial aircraft deliveries for the year between 715 and 725, assuming about 110 
deliveries of the 787 aircraft.
In a separate statement, Boeing said that in collaboration with Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China or COMAC, it has 
opened a demonstration facility that will turn waste cooking oil, commonly referred to as 'gutter oil' in China, into 
sustainable aviation biofuel.
The two companies estimate that 500 million gallons or 1.8 billion liters of biofuel could be made annually in China 
from used cooking oil.
Boeing and COMAC are sponsoring the facility, which is called the China-US Aviation Biofuel Pilot Project. It will 
use a technology developed by Hangzhou Energy & Engineering Technology Co., Ltd. to clean contaminants from 
waste oils and convert it into jet fuel at a rate of 160 gallons or 650 liters, per day.
BA closed Tuesday's trading at USD127.12. In Wednesday's pre-market trades, the stock is up USD0.19 or 0.15% 
to USD127.31.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum says there are opportunities for the brave in the European airline market, as 
long at the Ebola virus is contained away from main traffic areas. 
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo says concerns over the virus and the weaknesses in the eurozone economy has seen 
airline share prices and the euro fall in recent months. But as long as Ebola is contained away from the main traffic 
regions, the impact on the demand for air travel is likely to be limited, the analyst says. 
"Of more concern is the weak economic outlook for the eurozone. Focus on airlines with strong balance sheets and 
efficient cost bases," Khoo says.
The analyst says International Consolidated Airlines Group remains Liberum's top pick because of its strength in 
the UK-US market, which gives its less exposure to the eurozone than any of its other peers. Liberum has a Buy 
rating, with a 550 pence price target on the stock. 
In addition, Liberum has upgraded easyJet to Buy from Hold, maintaining its 1,650p price target, and Ryanair to 
Buy from Hold, with a price target increase to EUR8.50 from EUR7.10, on the expectation that any market 
weaknesses provide another opportunity for market share gains for the companies.  
IAG shares are down 0.1% at 350.10 pence, easyJet is down 0.4% at 1,404.00p and Ryanair is down 0.1% at 
EUR6.96.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The FTSE 100 closed lower Monday, failing to build on the recovery made late last 
week, with oil stocks again amongst the worst performers as the oil price fell. 
The FTSE 100 closed down 0.7% at 6,267.07, the FTSE 250 closed flat at 14,755.97 and the AIM All-Share 
outperformed to close up 0.5% at 692.44. 
The main European indices fared worse than London, with the CAC 40 ending the day down 1.0% and the DAX 
down 1.5%. US equities, meanwhile, were trading mixed at the London close, with the DJIA trading down 0.1%, 
while the S&P was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.7%. 
The price of gold rose during the day to trade at USD1244.47 per ounce at the European close, as investors 
continued to support the price of the asset perceived as a safe haven.
Oil stocks weighed on the blue-chip and mid-cap indices, as the price of Brent oil fell to USD84.39 per barrel. 
Stocks such as BG Group, down 3.8%, Tullow Oil, down 2.6%, and Royal Dutch Shell 'A', down 2.3%, were 
amongst the top fallers in the FTSE 100, while the FTSE 350 oil and gas producers index closed down 2.3%, 
making it the biggest falling sector index. 
Afren bucked the trend, ending up 0.2% on the FTSE 250, after the Daily Telegraph reported over the weekend that 
filings revealed a company founded by a former Nigerian general has amassed a significant shareholding in the 
business, prompting speculation the oil and gas producer could become a takeover target.
Airlines performed well, boosted by the low oil price and a positive note from Liberum, which said there are 
opportunities for investors in the European airlines sector as long as the Ebola virus is contained away from main 
traffic areas. International Consolidated Airlines Group closed up 3.1%, Ryanair up 1.8%, and easyJet up 1.6%. 
MARKET COMMENT: FTSE 100 Fails To Maintain Rally, Oil Stocks Fall
Tesco also closed amongst the best performing stocks of the FTSE 100, closing up 2.7%, ahead of its first-half 
results on Thursday. Analysts believe that the company now has a better handle on its recent issues, after The 
Sunday Times reported that the investigation into the company's GBP250 million profit overstatement has found 
evidence of a cover-up as the commercial team at the company struggled to meet targets in the final months of the 
tenure of former chief executive Philip Clarke. The company is expected to say on Thursday that the review found 
patterns of "inappropriate" behaviour by staff, but that it will not have to restate its results for previous years, the 
paper said.
The latest grocery market share figures from Kantar Worldpanel, for the 12 weeks ending October 12, will be 
released on Tuesday at 0930 BST.
Third quarter earnings from US-listed International Business Machines Corp weighed on the DJIA. The company 
reported a sharp decline in profit for the third quarter, hurt by a charge related to the sale of its Microelectronics 
business to Globalfoundries. IBM had separately said it would pay USD1.5 billion to Globalfoundries, an investment 
arm of the government of Abu Dhabi, to take the chip business of its hands. It booked a USD3.4 billion net loss from 
discontinued operations in its third-quarter results. IBM shares were down 6.6% in New York.
The biggest economic release on Tuesday will occur before the London open, with a host of Chinese data releases 
at 0300 BST, most importantly GDP estimates for the third quarter. Japanese all industry activity index for August 
will be released at 0530 BST. 
UK public sector net borrowing for September will be released at 0930 BST, before the US Redbook index for the 
week ending October 17 at 1355 BST and existing home sales change for September at 1500 BST.
The corporate calendar is fairly busy and includes half-year results from Premier Inns hotels and Costa coffee chain 
operator Whitbread, interim management statements from FTSE 100-listed companies GKN, ARM Holdings, 
Reckitt Benckiser and InterContinental Hotels Group. AIM-listed ASOS will also be reporting full-year results. Apple 
will be reporting its third-quarter earnings after the US close Tuesday.

Paris (Alliance News) - Air France on Wednesday estimated the cost of two-week pilots' strike last month at up to 
500 million euros (633 million dollars).
Thousands of Air France flights were grounded by the September 15-28 strike over the company's plans to develop 
its low-cost subsidiary Transavia.
Air France-KLM traffic figures for September released Wednesday showed passenger numbers falling 16.3% to 5.7 
million.
The Franco-Dutch group estimated the impact of the strike on third-quarter operating results, which will be 
published at the end of October, at 320-350 million euros.
Adding the effect of the strike on bookings in the fourth quarter, the airline estimated the total impact of the longest-
ever strike by Air France pilots at "around 500 million euros."
The pilots' unions, who had drawn fierce criticism for their perceived intransigence from customers, ground staff and 
the government, ended the strike on September 28 despite failing to agree on a new pay deal for Transavia pilots.
Air France says it needs to reduce crew costs to make Transavia into a competitor to the likes of Ryanair and 
Easyjet.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Jefferies is keeping a Buy rating on easyJet because it expects the airline's shares to 
keep rising over 12 months, but it says the investment case is something of a conundrum and it still prefers Ryanair.
EasyJet raised its profit guidance for the financial year that just ended Friday, citing passenger steals from strike hit 
Air France and favourable fuel prices. It raised its revenue per seat guidance for the second half of that year to 
about 2% growth, up from a July forecast of 1%, and said costs per seat are expected to rise 0.7% on the year, 
compared with previous guidance of a 0.5% increase.
Jefferies said that revenue per seat growth "is softer than (some) expected, but cost progress is better". 
"Beyond our long EZJ/short AF-KLM idea into this update, we do not have particularly strong conviction ourselves 
at the moment," it write in a note to clients.
The investment bank thinks easyJet's 15% capacity expansion at Gatwick after it bought takeoff and landing slots 
from Flybe is short-term pain for long-term gain, and it believes "there is significant opportunity for improved 
revenue performance as the slot portfolio is optimised next summer".
"We are more cautious into winter but fuel help, and a higher profit base, leaves us happy with our above 
consensus FY15 estimates for now," it added.
Jefferies is forecasting 5.1% revenue growth for fiscal 2015, the current financial year, based on revenue per seat 
growth of 1.8% at constant exchange rates. It is also forecasting easyJet's fiscal 2015 pretax profit at GBP639 
million, above the current consensus forecast of GBP628 million, as modest cost inflation and an easier fuel price 
offset the more modest revenue per seat growth prediction.
Jefferies also thinks a GBP100 million special dividend is possible when easyJet put out its full fiscal 2014 results in 
November, but thinks that a special dividend for the current financial year is more likely.

Jefferies is keeping a Buy rating on easyJet with a 1,500.00 pence price target. It has Ryanair at Buy also, with a 
EUR8.00 price target.
EasyJet shares were up 6.4% at 1,459.10 pence Friday morning, the best-performing stock on the FTSE 100. 
Ryanair shares were up 0.8% at EUR7.45.

LONDON (Alliance News) - EasyJet PLC Friday raised its full-year pretax profit guidance, saying it had taken about 
GBP5 million of revenue from Air France after that airline was hit by a costly pilots strike and after fuel prices swung 
in its favour.
In a trading update, the low-cost airline said it now expects pretax profit for the year that ended on September 30 to 
come in between GBP575 million and GBP580 million, up from the GBP545 million to GBP570 million guidance it 
gave in July.
"The impact of the Air France pilots' strike in September is expected to increase easyJet's revenue by circa GBP5 
million as Air France passengers switched to easyJet," the British airline said in a statement.
Air France, part of Air France-KLM, was hit by a two-week pilots strike that ended on September 29. The pilots were 
protesting at the company's cost-cutting plans. Air France management said the strike cost the airline more than 
EUR200 million.
The Air France pilots are also angry about the company's plans to expand its low-cost operation, Transavia, via 
regional hubs around Europe, in an effort to compete with the likes of easyJet and Ryanair Holdings PLC. The 
company reportedly agreed to expand its Transavia operations only within France as a concession to the unions, 
but insists that it must have the right to vary employment contracts for those working at the low-cost subsidiary. The 
pilots - Air France pilots are paid more than Transavia pilots - want the same contract to be offered to all pilots 
across all Air France's operations.
EasyJet has a 14% market share for all passengers in France and 24% of the business market, according to Cantor 
Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde, who last week wrote that he expected the British airline to be the main beneficiary of 
Air France's decision to drop or scale back Transavia's expansion. 
UPDATE: EasyJet Raises Profit Guidance As It Takes Revenue From Air France
EasyJet raised its guidance for revenue per seat in the second half of the year, and said unit fuel costs were now 
set to be favourable in the half. It said second-half capacity growth rose about 6.3%, down from previous guidance 
of a 6.4% increase, revenue per seat at constant currencies rose about 2%, up from the 1% forecast it gave in July, 
and it expects cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currencies to up about 0.7% on the year, compared with 
previous guidance of a 0.5% increase.
It said unit fuel costs in the six months to September 30 were favourable to the tune of about GBP2 million, 
compared with the adverse impact of up to GBP5 million it had predicted in July. 
It said exchange rate movements in the second half were favourable by about GBP15 million, having previously 
predicted a favourable impact of up to GBP15 million.
The airline said it had a strong end to its financial year and its main summer trading period. Revenue per seat at 
constant currency in the final quarter grew about 1.5% .
It said it flew 6.1 million passengers in September, a 7.5% increase on the 5.7 million it flew in September 2013. 
Load factor increased 2.5 percentage points to 92.2%, from 89.7%.
On a rolling 12 month basis, passenger number to the end of September were up 6.6% to 64.8 million, and its load 
factor, a measure of how full its planes are, rose to 90.6%, from 89.3% in the previous 12 months.

LONDON (Alliance News) - EasyJet PLC Friday raised its full-year pretax profit guidance, saying it had taken about 
GBP5 million of revenue from Air France after that airline was hit by a costly pilots strike and after fuel prices swung 
in its favour.
In a trading update, the low-cost airline said it now expects pretax profit for the year that ended on September 30 to 
come in between GBP575 million and GBP580 million, up from the GBP545 million to GBP570 million guidance it 
gave in July.
"The impact of the Air France pilots' strike in September is expected to increase easyJet's revenue by circa GBP5 
million as Air France passengers switched to easyJet," the British airline said in a statement.
Air France, part of Air France-KLM, was hit by a two-week pilots strike that ended on September 29. The pilots were 
protesting at the company's cost-cutting plans. Air France management said the strike cost the airline more than 
EUR200 million.
The Air France pilots are also angry about the company's plans to expand its low-cost operation, Transavia, via 
regional hubs around Europe, in an effort to compete with the likes of easyJet and Ryanair Holdings PLC. The 
company reportedly agreed to expand its Transavia operations only within France as a concession to the unions,

factor, a measure of how full its planes are, rose to 90.6%, from 89.3% in the previous 12 months.
The airline added that it expects to declare a dividend for fiscal 2014 based on a pay-out ratio of 40% of profit after 
tax, in line with its recently-revised dividend policy. It previously paid out about 33% of profit after tax.
"We finished the year strongly. Our performance demonstrates our continued focus on cost and progress against all 
our strategic revenue priorities and further emphasises easyJet's structural advantage against both legacy and low-
cost competition," Chief Executive Carolyn McCall said in a statement.
The airline has grown strongly under McCall's leadership. Early in her tenure, she faced criticism from airline 
founder and current shareholder Stelios Haji-Ioannou for her fleet expansion plans, but she faced down that 
criticism and has rewarded shareholders with a strong share price performance and increased dividend payouts.

Cantor Fitzgerald, which reiterated its Buy rating on the stock with a 1,600 pence price target, thinks easyJet will 
pay a 46.5 pence dividend for fiscal 2014, yielding 3.3%. It also thinks there is a "significant chance" the airline's 
board will announce a special dividend, after it handed out a 44.1 pence special dividend for fiscal 2013. 
Looking ahead, EasyJet said it has sold over a quarter of seats for the first half of the current year, slightly ahead of 
what it had sold at the same stage last year. It thinks its fuel bill for the first six months of this fiscal year will be 
about GBP20 million less than in the first half of fiscal 2014, while exchange rate movements are likely to have a 
favourable impact of about GBP10 million compared with a year earlier. 
For the whole year, it is currently expecting its fuel bill to fall about GBP50 million compared with the year just 
ended, while it expects currency movements to have an adverse impact of about GBP20 million.
It said it is 78% hedged for its fuel requirements in fiscal 2015 at an average rate of USD948 a tonne, and 52% 
hedged for fiscal 2016 at an average of USD928 a tonne.
"We finished the year strongly. Our performance demonstrates our continued focus on cost and progress against all

Ryanair Welcomes Ruling On State Aid Rules, To Appeal On Zweibruecken

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Wednesday welcomed the EU Commission's confirmation that 
its airport agreements at Brussels Charleroi, Frankfurt Hahn, Alghero and Stockholm Vasteras do not infringe the 
EU state aid rules.
The EU Wednesday ordered Germany and Belgium to recoup illegal state aid granted to two airfields. This involved 
the Charleroi airport near the Belgian capital Brussels and the now-insolvent Zweibruecken airport in Germany, 
located about 200 kilometres from Frankfurt.
Charleroi is used mainly by Ryanair, while Zweibruecken caters to Germanwings, TUIFly and Ryanair. Insolvency 
proceedings for the German airport were opened on Wednesday.
Ryanair will, however, appeal the decision concerning Zweibrücken, where it ceased operations in 2009, saying its 
airport arrangements complied with the state aid rules. It has instructed its lawyers to appeal this ruling to the extent 
that it alleges the arrangements did not.  
"Ryanair has to date carried over 136 million passengers at the 10 airports where our commercial arrangements 
have been confirmed by the EU Commission and the EU Court to comply with EU law, compared to just 50,000 
passengers at Zweibrücken airport where the Commission today suggested that the airport agreement did not 
comply with State aid rules," said Director of Legal and Regulatory Affairs Juliusz Komorek in a statement.
In the case of Charleroi, the airport should pay back EUR6 million, the commission said, saying that competition 
was significantly distorted by aid granted since 2002, which helped the airfield to "develop considerably."
The commission has also launched an investigation into Charleroi's main competitor, the Zaventem airport in 
Brussels. At issue is a EUR19 million yearly state support scheme granted to the airfield for 2014-16. Most of the 
funds are reportedly going to the national carrier Brussels Airlines.
"We remain committed to growing traffic from the current 87 million passengers a year to over 150 million 
passengers a year by 2024, in partnership with both private and public airports across Europe where all of our 
Ryanair Welcomes Ruling On State Aid Rules, To Appeal On Zweibruecken
arrangements are arms-length commercial deals consistent with the EU Market Economy Investor Principle," 
Komorek added. 
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 1.3% at EUR7.45 Wednesday.

Brussels (Alliance News) - The EU turned up the heat Wednesday on airports catering to low-cost airlines, ordering 
Germany and Belgium to recoup illegal state aid they granted to two airfields.
"EU state aid rules allow public authorities to grant support to airports where it is justified," EU Competition 
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
"However, duplicating unprofitable airport infrastructure or unduly favouring certain airlines wastes taxpayers' 
money and distorts competition," he added.
At issue are the Charleroi airport near the Belgian capital Brussels and the now-insolvent Zweibruecken airport in 
Germany, located about 200 kilometres from Frankfurt.
Charleroi is used mainly by Ryanair, while Zweibruecken caters to Germanwings, TUIFly and Ryanair. Insolvency 
proceedings for the German airport were opened on Wednesday.
Zweibruecken has received support measures amounting to about 47 million euros (59 million dollars) since 2000, 
according to the European Commission, the EU's executive.
But the aid "unnecessarily duplicated already existing, unprofitable airport infrastructure in the same region," the 
commission found, pointing to the Saarbruecken airport, some 40 kilometers away. The support gave Zweibruecken 
an "undue economic advantage," it said.
Airlines were also given an undue advantage through agreements concluded with Zweibruecken, the commission 
found, saying that Germanwings has to pay back about 1.2 million euros, while Ryanair and TUIFly owe around 
500,000 and 200,000 euros respectively.
In the case of Charleroi, meanwhile, the airport should pay back 6 million euros, the commission said, saying that 
competition was significantly distorted by aid granted since 2002, which helped the airfield to "develop 
considerably."
EU Orders Germany, Belgium To Recover Aid From Low-Cost Airports
The commission has also launched an investigation into Charleroi's main competitor, the Zaventem airport in 
Brussels. At issue is a 19-million-euro yearly state support scheme granted to the airfield for 2014-16.
Most of the funds are reportedly going to the national carrier Brussels Airlines.
"The commission has concerns that this measure would lead to public money being used to fund ordinary operating 
costs of selected airlines without furthering any objective of common interest," the EU institution said.

Frankfurt (Alliance News) - Lufthansa pilots are to go on strike Tuesday for the fifth time this year amid an ongoing 
row over retirement benefits.
The pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit, announced Monday that the industrial action will take place at Frankfurt 
airport, Germany's largest, from 8 am to 11 pm local time.
Travellers will face fresh disruptions as long-haul flights will be affected. The union said it was forced to resort to 
such measures as talks with the Lufthansa management were deadlocked and it had not offered a compromise.
The group's pilots have already walked off the job four times this year over Lufthansa's plans to scrap its current 
retirement benefits scheme.
Those strikes resulted in the cancellation of 4,300 flights and forced hundreds of thousands of passengers to face 
lengthy delays or make alternative transport arrangements.
The 5,400 pilots employed at Lufthansa, its budget offshoot Germanwings and Lufthansa Cargo want the company 
to maintain its current retirement benefits system, under which they can retire at 55 and continue to receive part of 
their wages.
Like other European carriers, Lufthansa is battling to reduce costs in the face of stiff competition from budget 
airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair as well as new emerging Middle East carriers, including Abu Dhabi-based 
Etihad and Dubai-based Emirates.

Frankfurt (Alliance News) - Lufthansa pilots are planning a walkout on Tuesday for the fifth time this year over 
retirement benefits, just as pilots at Air France end a two-week strike over that airline's cost-cutting plans.
Lufthansa pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit, said Monday that the industrial action would take place at Frankfurt 
airport, Germany's largest, from 8 am to 11 pm local time.
Travellers will face fresh disruptions as long-haul flights will be affected. The union said services on Airbus A380, 
A330, A340 and Boeing B747 would be hit.
It said it was forced to resort to such measures as talks with the Lufthansa management were deadlocked and it 
had not offered a compromise.
The group's pilots have already walked off the job four times this year over Lufthansa's plans to scrap its current 
retirement benefits scheme.
Those strikes resulted in the cancellation of 4,300 flights and forced hundreds of thousands of passengers to face 
lengthy delays or make alternative transport arrangements.
The strike call comes a day after the largest pilots' union at Air France called off a strike that had lasted two weeks, 
costing the airline more than 200 million euros, according to management.
The SNPL union said it was ending the walkout out of a "sense of responsibility," despite failing to reach agreement 
with the carrier on the development of its low-cost subsidiary Transavia.
The pilots had been severely criticized for their perceived intransigence by the government, media and Air France 
ground staff.
UPDATE: Lufthansa Pilots Plan Walkout As Air France Ends Two-Week Strike
The airline, which was forced to cancel thousands of flights, welcomed the end of the protest and said the flight 
schedule would "gradually return to normal" from Tuesday.
The pilots are pushing for a single contract for all Air France pilots that would also cover those at Transavia, its 
discount division which Air France aims to develop into a rival of low-cost operators such as Ryanair and Easyjet.
Air France has rejected their demands, saying it needs to cut costs to compete in the competitive European leisure 
travel market.
Lufthansa, too, is battling to reduce costs in the face of stiff competition from budget airlines and new emerging 
Middle East carriers, including Abu Dhabi-based Etihad and Dubai-based Emirates.
The 5,400 pilots employed at Lufthansa, its budget offshoot Germanwings and Lufthansa Cargo want the company

LONDON (Alliance News) - EasyJet will be the main beneficiary of the decision earlier this week by Air France KLM 
to drop plans to expand its low-cost airline Transavia, says Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde.
After upgrading the stock earlier in the week following an encouraging investor day, Cantor Fitzgerald reiterates a 
Buy recommendation with a price target of 1,600p.
EasyJet shares were quoted up 0.55 at 1,356 pence early Friday.
The Air France-KLM decision was in response to 11 days of pilot strikes at Air France, which cost the group about 
EUR200 million in lost revenues.
Cantor Fitzgerald says that France is a key and growing market for easyJet, where it currently has a 14% market 
share for all passengers and 24% of the business market. Moreover, easyJet has the number one or two positions 
at eight out of the ten major French airports, and on a number of key routes from Paris it is the only significant 
competitor to Air France, says Byde.
In contrast, Ryanair is still only a minor player in the market, with just 5% of the seats on the key routes, the Cantor 
analyst says.
Cantor Fitzgerald forecasts that easyJet will continue to expand capacity in France by about 5% per year for the 
next few years, while the service of Air France and its partners is expected to remain unchanged after Thursday's 
announcement.
The brokerage says that easyJet's French business is well balanced between domestic, inbound and outbound, as 
well as business and leisure. "This broad mix is usually positive for load factors and aircraft utilisation," says Byde.

(An item published at 1423 BST misstated Ryanair's previous passenger number forecast. The correct version 
follows.)
LONDON (Alliance News) - EasyJet has put in a strong performance Thursday, with its shares boosted by a 
positive update from sector peer Ryanair that came on the back easyJets's investor day and ahead of its own 
trading statement due next week.
Ryanair Thursday raised its profit guidance for the current year Thursday, saying that the recent launch of new 
higher-end services and revamped website is paying off. The low-cost Irish carrier said it now expects to fly 87 
million customers in the year to March 31, 2015, up from its previous forecast of 86 million, which will take profits to 
the upper-end of previous guidance. Ryanair shares are up 1.7% at EUR7.439.
EasyJet shares have followed suit and are quoted up 2.5% at 1,348 pence Thursday, making the stock the best 
performer in the FTSE 100.
"I think it is mainly on the back of Ryanair, but equally easyJet had a very positive Capital Markets Day last week 
when it was bullish about growth prospects, cost-saving potential and the strength of its business model," says 
Director of travel & leisure equity research Wyn Ellis.
The gains come ahead of a scheduled update from easyJet, which is due to issue a pre-close trading statement on 
October 3.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Thursday said the recent launch of its new service for business 
travelers and the efforts it is making to improve its customer relations are paying off, as it raised its passenger 
numbers forecast for the current financial year and said it now expects its net profit to come in towards the top end 
of its previous guidance.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier by passenger numbers said it now expects to fly 87 million customers in the year 
to March 31, 2015, up from its previous forecast of 26 million. It expects its net profit for the fiscal year to be 
towards the top end of its previously guided EUR620 million to EUR650 million range. It reported profit after tax of 
EUR523 million in its last financial year and flew 81.7 million passengers.
"We now expect slightly stronger traffic growth in the winter schedule, as we open new bases in primary airports at 
Cologne, Gdansk, Glasgow and Warsaw Modlin, as well as significantly increasing flight frequencies and schedules 
from Dublin to UK cities, and from Dublin to European capitals," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told shareholders 
at the airline's annual general meeting in Dublin. 
The CEO said it is still too early to be confident about fares and yields in the second half of the fiscal year, but it has 
raised the profit and traffic guidance based on the continued strength of forward bookings and its improved 
customer experience moves.
"However, the full year profit outturn continues to be heavily dependent on second-half yields over which we have 
very little visibility at present. We will give an update on third quarter yield performance at our half year results 
announcement in early November," O'Leary said.
Ryanair has grown very rapidly, as customers flocked to its cheap-fares, no-frills model when travelling in Europe. 
However, it has been criticised for treating customers badly, including charging high charges when bookings aren't 
done properly online, and for taking hold bags.
Ryanair Raises Guidance, Saying New Softer Approach Is Paying Off
Ryanair in May admitted it had been annoying its customers with poor service, and introduced measures like 
allocated seating and relaxed cabin baggage and booking restrictions.
Last month, it then moved to catch up with rival easyJet PLC, which was reporting strong success with a tailored 
package for business travelers. Ryanair launched its own business class service offering features like premium 
seats, priority boarding and flexible tickets.
Ryanair shares were up 1.9% at EUR7.45 in London Thursday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Thursday said the recent launch of its new service for business 
travelers and the efforts it is making to improve its customer relations are paying off, as it raised its passenger 
numbers forecast for the current financial year and said it now expects its net profit to come in towards the top end 
of its previous guidance.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier by passenger numbers said it now expects to fly 87 million customers in the year 
to March 31, 2015, up from its previous forecast of 86 million. It expects its net profit for the fiscal year to be 
towards the top end of its previously guided EUR620 million to EUR650 million range. It reported profit after tax of 
EUR523 million in its last financial year and flew 81.7 million passengers.
"We now expect slightly stronger traffic growth in the winter schedule, as we open new bases in primary airports at 
Cologne, Gdansk, Glasgow and Warsaw Modlin, as well as significantly increasing flight frequencies and schedules 
from Dublin to UK cities, and from Dublin to European capitals," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told shareholders

LONDON (Alliance News) - UK indices ended Thursday lower as investors become increasingly weary of a 
potential US Federal Reserve rate hike amid solid economic data from the country.
The FTSE 100 closed the day down 1% at 6,639.71, the FTSE 250 closed 0.7% lower at 15,425.91, while the AIM 
All-Share recorded a 0.3% loss to close at 751.3.
European equity markets traded lower as well with the French CAC 40 closing down 1.5% and the German DAX 
down 1.7%. 
US indices are trading lower at the London close, with the DJIA down 1.2%, the S&P 500 down 1.3% and the 
Nasdaq Composite down 1.7%. Early trade in the US sees all three indices hand back all of the gains made 
Wednesday. 
UK shares suffered this afternoon when data from the US came in ahead of expectations, raising concerns that the 
Fed could increase interest rates. US initial jobless claims for the week ending September 19 came in at 293,000; 
below the expectation of 300,000 but above 281,000 the previous week. 
The continuing jobless claims for the week ending September 12 also beat expectations, coming in at 2.439 million, 
below the forecast of 2.45 million but above 2.432 million the week before. 
US durable goods orders for August did come in a little short of economist forecasts, showing a fall of 18.2%, below 
the expected fall of 18%. The figure for July showed an increase of 22.5%. Excluding orders for transportation 
equipment, durable goods orders actually rose by 0.7% in August compared to a 0.5% drop in July. The rebound 
matched economist estimates.
MARKET COMMENT: US Fed Rate Hike Fear Sends UK Shares Tumbling
The pound, meanwhile, jumped in value against the dollar amid comments made by Bank of England Governor 
Mark Carney saying that the central bank is closer to raising interest rates, as the economy has largely normalised. 
"With many of the conditions for the economy to normalize now met, the point at which interest rates also begin to 
normalise is getting closer," Carney said in a speech at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries General Insurance 
Conference, Wales. "In recent months the judgement about precisely when to raise Bank Rate has become more 
balanced," he said. 
The pound recovered to USD1.6342 against the greenback, from early 1-week low of USD1.6275. At the close of 
European trade, sterling was trading the dollar at USD1.6302.
In individual stock news, easyJet put in a strong performance, with its shares boosted by a positive update from 
sector peer Ryanair that came on the back easyJet's investor day and ahead of its own trading statement due next 
week. 
Ryanair raised its profit guidance for the current year Thursday, saying that the recent launch of new higher-end 
services and revamped website is paying off. The low-cost Irish carrier said it now expects to fly 87 million 
customers in the year to March 31, 2015, up from its previous forecast of 86 million, which will take profits to the 
upper-end of previous guidance. EasyJet shares ended the day atop the FTSE 100, gaining 2.7%.
Miners also weighed UK indices with the FTSE 350 mining sector index falling 2.6%. This comes on the back of 
more falls in prices in commodities, with gold hitting its lowest price since early January Thursday, before 
recovering later in the day. Brent Oil hit its lowest price since 2012 on Wednesday. 
Companies such as Fresnillo, down 3.6%, and BHP Billiton, down 2.9% were amongst the biggest fallers in the 
FTSE 100, while Polymetal International, down 4.4% was a notable faller in the FTSE 250. 
"The sector has taken the brunt of the selling as raw materials' prices dive once again, and spells out a very bleak 
outlook for the FTSE 100 versus other indices given its heavy mining contingent," said IG market analyst Chris 
Beauchamp. 
In the FTSE 250, CSR topped the index after it said the Takeover Panel has granted an extension to the deadline 
for Microchip Technology Inc to make a bid for the company. CSR said the deadline for the US semiconductor 
maker to make a bid has been extended to October 15 in order to allow the two companies more time to conclude 
their discussions. The company's shares gained 5%. 
Meanwhile, Mitchells & Butlers shares fell 7.9%, making it the worst performing stock of the mid-cap index. The UK 
pubs and restaurant operator said total sales in the 51 weeks of its financial year grew by 3.8%, helped by better 
food and drink sales, but said that after strong demand in July following the World Cup, trading conditions in August 
slumped. In a pre-close trading update, the company said like-for-like sales in the 51 weeks to September 20 were 
up 0.6%, however it said growth in the nine weeks to September 20 was minimal, up just 0.1% as food sales grew 
by 0.1% and drink sales declined by 0.2%. 
With no domestic economic releases Friday, the focus will be on Germany in the morning with the Gfk consumer 
confidence survey for October, released at 0700 BST, before turning to US for annualised gross domestic product 
for the second quarter and personal consumption expenditure prices for the same period, both at 1330 BST. 
The corporate calendar is even quieter, with the only release coming from AIM-listed Digital Globe Services which 
will report its full-year results.

Frankfurt (Alliance News) - Lufthansa pilots on Thursday threatened further industrial action after their talks with the 
German airline over a retirement scheme broke down.
Travellers could expect a fresh disruption to services after the pilot union Vereinigung Cockpit said its latest round 
of negotiations with Lufthansa ended without agreement.
The group's pilots have already walked off the job four times this year over Lufthansa's plans to scrap its current 
retirement benefits scheme.
The strike action resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights and forced thousands of passengers to face 
lengthy delays or to make alternative transport arrangements.
Like other European carriers, Lufthansa is battling to reduce costs in the face of stiff competition from budget 
airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair as well as new emerging Middle East carriers, including Abu Dhabi-based 
Etihad and Dubai-based Emirates.
While Lufthansa passengers face fresh industrial action, there were signals in France of an end to the Air France 
pilots 11-day strike over the Paris-based airline's plans for expanding its low-cost subsidiary, Transavia.
The German pilots' union called off another planned strike earlier in the month after the airline reopened 
negotiations on the scheme.
The 5,400 pilots employed at Lufthansa, its budget offshoot Germanwings and Lufthansa Cargo want the company 
to maintain its current retirement benefits system, under which they can retire at 55 and continue to receive part of 
their wages.

follows.)
 
LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Direct Line Insurance Group said it has agreed to sell its international division, which is comprised of its Italian and 
German operations, for EUR550.0 million to Mapfre SA, and said it expects to return substantially all of the net 
proceeds to shareholders. In a statement, Direct Line said it expects the sale to result in a pretax gain on disposal 
of about GBP160.0 million. It said further details of the capital return will be disclosed upon completion of the deal, 
but noted that its "strong capital position" was the reason it expects to make the return.
----------
GlaxoSmithKline confirmed that it will appoint Royal Bank of Scotland Group Chairman Philip Hampton as non-
executive chairman from September 1 2015, or at an earlier date if released from his other commitments. Hampton 
will succeed current Chairman Christopher Gent. He will initially join the board as a non-executive director at the 
start of 2015, and will take on the role of deputy chairman April 1, 2015. "Sir Philip's appointment provides a clear 
plan of succession and we welcome him to our board," said Senior Independent Non-Executive Director Deryck 
Maughan in a statement.

its existing issued share capital.
----------
Sports Direct International said it has entered into a put option agreement to acquire a 0.28% stake in Tesco, a 
move that continues a record of the sports goods retailer or its founder Mike Ashley taking stakes, or options to buy 
stakes, in struggling retailers. Sports Direct said its maximum exposure under the put option is limited to around 
GBP43 million. The 0.28% stake represents a total of 23 million Tesco shares. "This investment reflects Sports

Billiton, which is grappling with falling commodity prices, has also put a freeze on the remuneration to be paid to 
Mackenzie and other members of the company's senior management team for fiscal 2015.
----------
A federal judge in New Orleans rejected Wednesday BP's request for recouping millions of dollars of overpayments 
made to some claimants under the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill settlement. The oil giant found that it ended up 
overpaying the victims of the oil spill after the court revised the method for calculating the damages. It claimed that 
the families and companies were reportedly allowed to inflate their losses by the administrator in charge of 
processing the claims. At a court hearing in New Orleans, US District Court Judge Carl Barbier earlier in the day 
heard out attorneys for BP and claimants before reaching the decision. BP will reportedly appeal the decision.
----------

deadline for Microchip Technology Inc to make bid for the company. Shares in CSR were up 5.3% to 767 pence in 
early trade after the chipmaker said the deadline for the US semiconductor maker to make a bid for the company 
had been extended to October 15 in order to allow the two companies more time to conclude their discussions. 
CSR rejected a takeover bid from Microchip on August 28 as it felt the original bid was too low.
----------
Micro Focus International said Deputy Chairman and non-Executive Senior Independent Director David Maloney

Eurozone money supply growth accelerated in August while lending to private sector continued to decline, data 
from the European Central Bank showed. M3 money supply increased 2% year-on-year in August, faster than the 
CORRECT: TOP NEWS: Glaxo Recruits New Chairman Philip Hampton From RBS
1.8% rise in July. Likewise, M1 growth improved to 5.8% from 5.6% in July. The three-month average of the annual

Ukraine wants to apply for EU membership in 2020, President Petro Poroshenko said, after the implementation of a 
reform programme. Earlier this month, Ukraine ratified a far-reaching association and trade agreement with the 
bloc. The EU says the agreement is a necessary step for membership, but does not automatically guarantee it. 
Poroshenko told a conference of judges in Kiev that the Strategy 2020 programme contains 60 reforms, according 
to local media reports.
----------
Airstrikes carried out late Wednesday against Islamic State targets in Syria hit oil refineries that the US says provide 
a revenue stream for the militants, the Pentagon says. The oil refineries provide about USD2 million a day in 
revenue for the Islamic State, Rear Admiral John Kirby says. Kirby spoke after the raids ended and all aircraft 
returned safely. The US was joined by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirites in carrying out the strikes, Kirby 
says.
----------
US President Barack Obama called Wednesday for the global community to join the fight against Islamic State 
militants in Iraq and Syria. Obama also told the United Nations General Assembly in New York that the world should 
unite against pressing global challenges, including Russian aggression in Europe and the Ebola outbreak in West 
Africa. But he stressed the greatest challenge to peace and prosperity was posed by Islamist extremism.
----------
China is debating whether to oust the head of its central bank due to disagreements over financial policy, The Wall 
Street Journal reported. The departure of People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan would be justified on 
the grounds of the 66-year-old's age, the report said, citing party officials. But disagreements over financial policy in 
the world's second-largest economy would be the real reason for his ouster, the report said. Zhou is pressing for 
market reforms including a liberalization of interest rates but the party leadership fears the impact on an economy 
whose growth has slowed recently.
----------
US President Obama also vowed Wednesday to continue pursuing a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict, 
even as he directly called on Israelis to continue striving for peace. "The violence engulfing the region today has 
made too many Israelis ready to abandon the hard work of peace," he said in his address to the United Nations 
General Assembly. Veering from the text of his prepared speech, Obama added: "That's something worthy of 
reflection within Israel." Returning to his text, he continued: "Let's be clear: The status quo in the West Bank and 
Gaza is not sustainable."

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The major European markets rose for a second consecutive session on Thursday amid 
expectations the European Central Bank will add further stimulus to stave off economic stagnation in the eurozone.
The euro languishes near a 2-year low against the dollar after ECB President Mario Draghi reiterated that the bank 
is ready to use additional unconventional instruments within its mandate to counter risks of prolonged period of low 
inflation. In an interview with Lithuanian business daily Verslo Zinios, Draghi told that the ECB remains fully 
determined to counter risks to the medium-term outlook for inflation.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is rising 0.3%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, is up 0.2%. Around Europe, the German DAX is moving up 0.3% and France's 
CAC 40 is adding 0.2%, while the FTSE 100 of the UK is marginally lower.
Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC are climbing 2.2% in London. The airline raised its full-year traffic forecast and 
said it expects its full year net profit to be at the upper end of its previous outlook.
Cairn Energy is rallying 2.5% after it agreed to sell 10% of its stake in the Catcher development and adjacent 
acreage in the UK North Sea to Dyas UK.
GlaxoSmithKline PLC is gaining 0.7%. The company said that Philip Hampton will succeed Christopher Gent as 
non-executive chairman with effect from 1 September 2015, or at an earlier date if released from other 
commitments.
Bayer AG is adding half a percent in Frankfurt. Its group firm Bayer MaterialScience and Bluesign Technologies 
have entered into a strategic alliance to ensure safe production processes and working conditions along the entire 
value chain.
Hennes & Mauritz AB shares are tumbling 3.5% in Stockholm after the Swedish apparel retailer said sales had 
slowed in September due to unusually warm weather in most markets.
European Stocks Rise On Stimulus Hopes
Air Liquide SA is losing half a percent in Paris. The French industrial and medical gases maker said it is further 
expanding its relationship with BOE Technology Group with a major contract award to supply BOE's new G8.5 Flat 
Panel Display Device and System Project in Chongqing, China.
Dassault Aviation is declining 0.4% after its shareholders reportedly approved a plan that allows the French aircraft 
maker buyback up to 10% of its stock.
BP PLC shares are down 1.3% after a federal judge in New Orleans rejected the British oil giant's request for 
recouping millions of dollars of overpayments made to some claimants under the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill 
settlement.
In economic releases, Eurozone money supply growth accelerated in August while lending to private sector 
continued to decline, data from the European Central Bank showed. While M3 money supply increased 2% year-
on-year in August, faster than the 1.8% rise in July, credit extended to the private sector fell 1.9% annually, the 
same rate as seen in July.
Elsewhere, the Asian markets closed mixed, with Japanese shares climbing to a fresh seven-year high on a weaker 
yen, while the markets elsewhere showed little reaction to upbeat US data released overnight. With geopolitical 
tensions persisting and the dollar resuming its uptrend on optimism about the overall US growth outlook, investors 
largely remained on the sidelines.
The US index futures point to a slightly lower open later in the day ahead of reports on durable goods orders and 
weekly jobless claims.

LONDON (Alliance News) - GlaxoSmithKline Thursday confirmed that it will appoint Royal Bank of Scotland Group 
Chairman Philip Hampton as non-executive chairman from September 1, 2015, or at an earlier date if released from 
his other commitments.
The pharmaceutical company said Hampton will succeed current Chairman Christopher Gent, initially joining the 
board as a non-executive director at the start of 2015, before taking on the role of deputy chairman April 1, 2015.
Hampton became the chairman of RBS in February 2009, replacing Tom McKillop, as the bank turned to his 
stewardship at what was the beginning of its restructuring process in the wake of the financial crisis and its bailout 
by the UK government.
Together with former Chief Executive Stephen Hester, who succeeded Fred Goodwin, Hampton led the bank as it 
sold off numerous assets in order to shore up its balance sheet. Current Chief Executive Ross McEwan has 
focused the bank's activities on UK lending, a significant departure from the bold expansion strategy pursued by 
Goodwin in the years leading up to the crisis.
Hampton has previously served as chairman of J Sainsbury PLC and group finance director at Lloyds TSB Group, 
BT Group PLC, British Gas and British Steel PLC. 
Sports Direct International continued its record of taking stakes, or options to buy stakes, in struggling retailers as it 
entered into a put option agreement to acquire a 0.28% stake in Tesco.
Sports Direct said its maximum exposure under the put option is limited to around GBP43 million. The 0.28% stake 
represents 23 million Tesco shares.

The news comes as Tesco's woes continue. This week the UK's biggest supermarket chain saw GBP2 billion wiped 
off its market capitalisation after it said it had overstated its first-half pretax profit guidance by GBP250 million. 
Tesco has now cut its outlook and suspended four executives while it undertakes a thorough investigation into the 
profit overstatement. 
Sports Direct, however, remains confident in its prospects, "This investment reflects Sports Direct's growing 
relationship with Tesco and belief in Tesco's long-term future," the company said in a statement.
Ryanair saw its shares rise after raising its passenger numbers forecast for the current financial year and said it 
now expects its net profit to come in towards the top end of its previous guidance.
The low-cost airline said the recent launch of its new service for business travellers and the efforts it is making to 
improve its customer relations are paying off and it now expects to fly 87 million customers in the year to March 31, 
2015, up from its previous forecast of 86 million, and expects its net profit for the fiscal year to be towards the top 
end of its previously guided EUR620 million to EUR650 million range.

Markets: The FTSE 100 gave up slim early gains, and is now flat with the mining sector providing a big drag. Major 
European markets are holding on to early strength, supported by comments from European Central Bank President 
Mario Draghi, which have simultaneously pushed the euro to a 22-month low against the dollar.
Ahead of US initial jobless claims data at 1330 BST, US stock markets look set to open a little lower following 
strong gains on Wednesday. Apple shares may be in focus following the news that the US technology giant has 
been forced to pull its latest operating system in light of numerous complaints, just days after launching its two new 
iPhone models
Futures markets currently show the DJIA flat, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both set to open 0.1% 
lower.

Direct Line Insurance Group said it has agreed to sell its international division, which is comprised of its Italian and 
German operations, for EUR550.0 million to Mapfre SA, and said it expects to return substantially all of the net 
proceeds to shareholders. Direct Line said it expects the sale to result in a pretax gain on disposal of about 
GBP160.0 million. It said further details of the capital return will be disclosed upon completion of the deal, but noted 
that its "strong capital position" was the reason it expects to make the return.

Hammerson said it will conduct a share placing to raise about GBP400 million to help fund the GBP180 million 
acquisition of the rest of the Highcross shopping centre in Leicester that it doesn't already own, a GBP100 million 
investment in a new outlet shopping centre venture, and GBP120 million to fund existing developments. In a 
statement, the retail-focused real estate investment trust said it will place 71.3 million new shares, which is 9.99% of

Vodafone Group has sealed a partnership with Dresden University of Technology under which the pair will research 
and develop 5G technology. Vodafone said the partnership is part of a programme to partner with universities, 
technology companies and industry groups on developing the next generation of wireless technology. Dresden 
University has recently opened a 5G lab, which will offer specific facilities for researchers to test and evaluated a 
wide range of 5G technologies, Vodafone said. Vodafone has separately admitted it will delay decisions on entering 
the home broadband and television market until BT Group launches its consumer mobile offering, the Telegraph 
reported. BT is looking to re-enter the consumer mobile market early next year, a move that is expected to 
significantly undercut rivals who offer package deals for households.

BHP Billiton Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie has earned a pay package of USD8 million in his first year at the 
company's helm, about half the amount his predecessor Marius Kloppers earned in his final year. BHP Billiton, 
which is grappling with falling commodity prices, has also put a freeze on the remuneration to be paid to Mackenzie 
and other members of the company's senior management team for fiscal 2015.
----------
A federal judge in New Orleans rejected BP's request for recouping millions of dollars of overpayments made to 
some claimants under the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill settlement. The oil giant found that it ended up overpaying 
the victims of the oil spill after the court revised the method for calculating the damages. It claimed that the families 
and companies were reportedly allowed to inflate their losses by the administrator in charge of processing the 
claims. At a court hearing in New Orleans, US District Court Judge Carl Barbier earlier in the day heard out 
attorneys for BP and claimants before reaching the decision. BP will reportedly appeal the decision.
----------
Irish drug company Shire said it will pay USD56.5 million to settle a probe into its US sales and marketing practices 
for Adderall XR, Vyvanse Daytrana, Lialda and Pentasa for a period up to 2010. Its also paying USD2.9 million to 
resolve a similar complaint in Louisiana. 
----------
CSR shares topped the FTSE 250 after the group said the Takeover Panel has granted an extension to the 
deadline for Microchip Technology to make bid for the company. Shares in CSR were up 5.3% to 767 pence in 
early trade after the chipmaker said the deadline for the US semiconductor maker to make a bid for the company 
had been extended to October 15 in order to allow the two companies more time to conclude their discussions. 
CSR rejected a takeover bid from Microchip on August 28 as it felt the original bid was too low.
----------
UK Mail Group, one of the smaller competitors to Royal Mail Group, saw its shares slide early Thursday after it 
warned that parcels volumes had been below expectations in the three months to end-September, particularly in the 
latter weeks. In a trading update, the letters and parcels handling company said overall revenue for the six months 
to end-September, the first half of its financial year, are expected to be some 1% below the year-earlier period. 
Adjusted for one less working day in the period this year, underlying revenue will be flat, it said.
----------
The Real Good Food Co it will now take up its pricing complaint about the sugar subsidiary of Associated British 
Foods with the European Competition Authorities in Brussels, and said it has now negotiated two new supply 
contracts, which it hopes will stabilise its sugar business going forward.
----------
Micro Focus International said Deputy Chairman and non-Executive Senior Independent Director David Maloney 
has stepped down with immediate effect, in a statement ahead of its annual general meeting. The company said 
that, as it has continued to trade in line with guidance since its last update in August, it will provide no further trading 
update at the annual general meeting.
----------
UK pubs and restaurant operator Mitchells & Butlers said total sales in the 51 weeks of its financial year grew by 
3.8%, helped by better food and drink sales, but said that after strong demand in July following the World Cup, 
trading conditions in August slumped. In a pre-close trading update, the company known for brands including 
Harvester, Toby Carvery and O'Neill's bar, said like-for-like sales in the 51 weeks to September 20 were up 0.6%, 
however it said growth in the nine weeks to September 20 was minimal, up only 0.1% as food sales grew by 0.1% 
and drink sales declined by 0.2%.

Cairn Energy said it has signed a deal to farm-out a 10% interest in the Catcher oil field and adjacent acreage in the 
UK North Sea in return for Dyas UK Ltd funding exploration and development costs up to a cap of USD182 million,

----------
AIM Movers
----------
Surface Transforms is the best-performing AIM stock after it signed a pre-production contract with an unnamed 
international aerospace system supplier for the supply of its carbon ceramic brake discs to a US military aircraft. 
Shares in Cellcast are up after the company said it swung to a pretax profit in the first-half of the year, as it cut costs 
and booked a one-off payment of nearly GBP3.0 million from Sony subsidiary Entertainment Networks after it 
agreed the early termination of Cellcast's rights to manage the Freeview channel Movie Mix. SyQic is also up after it 
expressed confidence for the future and posted a rise in pretax profit in the half year to end-June, with a more than 
quadrupling in revenue driven by the recovery of its Indonesian business. Proteome Sciences is doing well after its 
PS Biomarker Services arm won a contract with Genting TauRx Diagnostic Centre Sdn Bhd to develop diagnostic 
products. At the other end of the market, Inditherm is the worst-performing company on AIM after reporting that it 
swung to a pretax loss in the first-half of the year as its margins were hit by a shift towards exports and its neonatal 
intensive care product distribution business, and it warned that the situation was likely to continue. Falanx Group is 
lower, even though the consultancy reported its first pretax profit driven by the continued turmoil in the Middle East 
and predicted that it will grow significantly over the next five years. Its profit was small, however, as it spent on 
recruiting new staff, establishing its cyber defence operations, and doing due diligence on potential acquisition 
targets. Clean Air Power is down after it had to withdraw its US Genesis EDGE Dual-Fuel test engine from the 
testing process until it has sorted out issues that were found with the selective catalytic reduction after-treatment 
system on the base diesel engine. Havelock Europa is another faller after it posted a flat loss in the first-half, but 
reported a decline in revenue amid a challenging business environment and said its full-year results will be 
dependent on the fourth quarter.

Top Economics And General
----------
Eurozone money supply growth accelerated in August while lending to private sector continued to decline, data 
from the European Central Bank showed. M3 money supply increased 2% year-on-year in August, faster than the 
1.8% rise in July. Likewise, M1 growth improved to 5.8% from 5.6% in July. The three-month average of the annual 
growth rates of M3 from June to August increased to 1.8% from 1.5% in the period from May to July.
----------
Ukraine wants to apply for EU membership in 2020, President Petro Poroshenko said, after the implementation of a 
reform programme. Earlier this month, Ukraine ratified a far-reaching association and trade agreement with the 
bloc. The EU says the agreement is a necessary step for membership, but does not automatically guarantee it. 
Poroshenko told a conference of judges in Kiev that the Strategy 2020 programme contains 60 reforms, according 
to local media reports.
----------
Airstrikes carried out late Wednesday against Islamic State targets in Syria hit oil refineries that the US says provide 
a revenue stream for the militants, the Pentagon says. The oil refineries provide about USD2 million a day in 
revenue for the Islamic State, Rear Admiral John Kirby says. Kirby spoke after the raids ended and all aircraft 
returned safely. The US was joined by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirites in carrying out the strikes, Kirby 
says.
----------
US President Barack Obama called Wednesday for the global community to join the fight against Islamic State 
militants in Iraq and Syria. Obama also told the United Nations General Assembly in New York that the world should 
unite against pressing global challenges, including Russian aggression in Europe and the Ebola outbreak in West 
Africa. But he stressed the greatest challenge to peace and prosperity was posed by Islamist extremism.
----------
China is debating whether to oust the head of its central bank due to disagreements over financial policy, The Wall 
Street Journal reported. The departure of People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan would be justified on 
the grounds of the 66-year-old's age, the report said, citing party officials. But disagreements over financial policy in 
REPEAT: UK MIDDAY BRIEFING: Glaxo Appoints Philip Hampton As Next Chairman
the world's second-largest economy would be the real reason for his ouster, the report said. Zhou is pressing for 
market reforms including a liberalization of interest rates but the party leadership fears the impact on an economy 
whose growth has slowed recently.
----------
US President Obama also vowed Wednesday to continue pursuing a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict, 
even as he directly called on Israelis to continue striving for peace. "The violence engulfing the region today has 
made too many Israelis ready to abandon the hard work of peace," he said in his address to the United Nations 
General Assembly. Veering from the text of his prepared speech, Obama added: "That's something worthy of 
reflection within Israel." Returning to his text, he continued: "Let's be clear: The status quo in the West Bank and 
Gaza is not sustainable."

Air France Makes Pilots "Final Offer" To Resolve Week-Old Strike
Air France Makes Pilots "Final Offer" To Resolve Week-Old Strike
Alliance News

Paris (Alliance News) - Air France-KLM CEO Alexandre de Juniac urged striking French pilots Monday to accept 
the airline's "final offer" for the resolution of a week-old industrial dispute that has cost the airline tens of millions of 
dollars.
Over half of Air France's pilots walked out on September 15 in protest over the airline's plans for the development of 
its low-cost subsidiary, Transavia.
At issue is the airline's plans to hire Transavia pilots on local contracts in southern Europe.
After days of deadlocked talks and thousands of cancelled flights Air France management on Monday proposed to 
suspend the plan until the end of the year.
Delaying the project would give the airline "time to hold an in-depth dialogue on the project and to create the 
necessary guarantees for the unions" on jobs, de Juniac said.
The main pilots union SNPL, which announced Saturday it was extending the strike until September 26, had yet to 
respond to the offer.
The strike is the longest by Air France pilots since 1998.
De Juniac estimated the cost to the airline of cancelling around two-thirds of its scheduled flights at 15-20 million 
euros a day.
"With what we have lost we could have bought four medium-range aircraft," he complained, labelling the dispute 
"disastrous for the company as it starts to get back on its feet."
Air France had just begun to rebound after years of heavy losses and thousands of job cuts.
Air France Makes Pilots "Final Offer" To Resolve Week-Old Strike
Ground staff, who have borne the brunt of recent restructuring plans, have expressed frustration with the pilots' 
reluctance to share in the sacrifices.
With Transavia the airline aims to go up against Ryanair, Easyjet and other low-cost carriers in the European 
leisure travel market.
De Juniac said the pilots needed to recognize the demands of competing at the low-cost end of the market, 
including on wage costs.

Air France Pilots Dig In On Day Two Of Strike

Paris (Alliance News) - A strike by pilots at Air France, which has grounded more than half of the airline's flights, 
entered a second day Tuesday with no sign of a resolution.
Air France said it was forced to cancel 60% of its scheduled flights on Tuesday and Wednesday, up from 48% on 
Monday, as six in 10 pilots stayed away in protest at the airline's plans for the development of its low-cost business.
The strike, which is to run through September 22, threatens to be the most disruptive at Air France since 1998.
The pilots say that Air France's plans to develop its low-cost subsidiary Transavia will lead to job losses in France 
and force crews to accept lower pay.
Air France sees Transavia as its only hope of muscling back in on the leisure travel market, where the French 
carrier is being outdistanced by low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet.
"It's Transavia or it's decline in Europe," the chief executive of the Air France-KLM group, Alexandre de Juniac, told 
RTL radio.
In a first concession to the pilots, the airline said it would cap its expansion of its Transavia fleet at 30 aircraft by 
2019, instead of 37 as originally proposed. At the moment, Transavia has 14.
Despite the disruptions, there were no scenes of chaos at French airports. Most Air France passengers had either 
chosen to postpone their travel or booked themselves onto competing carriers.
In Germany, meanwhile, a threatened strike Tuesday by Lufthansa pilots, which could have further complicated air 
travel in Europe, was called off at the last minute.
The Cockpit pilots union, which is protesting the airline's plans for a new early-retirement scheme, said Lufthansa 
had presented a new offer that was "worth discussing."

The strike would have been the fourth by Lufthansa pilots in three weeks.

Frankfurt/Paris (Alliance News) - German pilots union Cockpit has called off a strike scheduled for Tuesday due to 
advances in negotiations with Lufthansa, the union said late Monday.
The surprising development came on the eve of a plan by pilots to walk off the job for the fourth time in three weeks 
as part of a campaign to head off a new early-retirement scheme.
The airline sent the pilots a new set of conditions for the plan, prompting the pilots' bargaining committee to call off 
Tuesday's strike and offer dates for new rounds of negotiations.
Cockpit spokesman Joerg Handwerg told dpa that Lufthansa had presented a "modified offer" that was "worth 
discussing." He said that it was not clear whether the concession would be enough to resolve the labour dispute.
Pilots at the airline's main Frankfurt hub were to strike for eight hours starting 9 am local time Tuesday. The airline 
now expects its flight schedule will be mostly normal.
Last week, Lufthansa was forced to cancel about 140 flights at Munich Airport because of a strike. That followed 
industrial action last month by pilots at Frankfurt Airport and a strike by pilots working for Lufthansa's budget 
offshoot, Germanwings.
Pilots with Air France meanwhile began a week-long strike, forcing the airline to cancel nearly half of its flights 
Monday.
Some 60% of Air France pilots walked off the job over management's proposal to introduce lower wage packages 
for crews working at Air France's low-cost subsidiary, Transavia.
The strike, which is to run through September 22, is shaping up as the most disruptive at Air France since 1998.
At Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, the airline's counters were swamped by stranded passengers looking to be 
rebooked on other flights.
Lufthansa Pilots Nix Tuesday Strike As Air France Pilots Stay Away
Air France, which is compensating passengers for cancelled flights, estimated the strike would set the company 
back between 10 and 15 million euros (13 million to 19 million dollars) a day.
Both Air France and Lufthansa are trying to cut costs to compete with Ryanair, Vueling and other budget carriers.
Lufthansa wants to scrap a retirement plan under which its 5,400 pilots can retire at 55 and continue to receive part 
of their wages.
Air France wants to hire crews on smaller pay to build up its low-cost business at Transavia. Air France pilots are 
demanding a single contract for all the group's pilots.
The strike comes as the Air France-KLM group is starting to turn a corner after years of heavy losses, which had 
prompted thousands of job cuts.
Last year, the group turned an operating profit for the first time in three years. The group aims to achieve net profits 
by the end of 2015.

Paris (Alliance News) - European air traffic was poised for major disruptions Monday as Air France pilots embarked 
on a week-long strike, forcing the airline to cancel nearly half its flights, and Lufthansa pilots also announced 
renewed industrial action.
Some 60% of Air France pilots walked off the job Monday over management's proposal to introduce lower wage 
packages for crews working at Air France's low-cost Transavia subsidiary.
The strike, which is to run through September 22, is shaping up as the most disruptive at Air France since 1998.
At Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris the airline's counters were swamped by stranded passengers looking to be 
rebooked on other flights.
Air France, which is compensating passengers for cancelled flights, estimated the strike would set the company 
back between 10 and 15 million euros (13 million to 19 million dollars) a day, affecting profits.
Lufthansa pilots, meanwhile, announced they would strike Tuesday for the fourth time in three weeks as part of a 
campaign to head off a planned new early retirement scheme.
Pilots at the airline's main Frankfurt hub will walk out at 9 am (0700 GMT) on Tuesday, the Vereinigung Cockpit 
union announced.
"As Lufthansa management has not put forward an offer that is suitable for a compromise, we see ourselves forced 
to take further action," the union said.
The German airline said it was working on an emergency travel plan to ease the impact of the strike, which could 
result in the cancellation of up to 40 flights.
"The VC has lost all sense," said a Lufthansa spokesman. "Their target is the passenger."
UPDATE: Air France , Lufthansa buffeted by strikes
Last week, Lufthansa was forced to cancel about 140 flights at Munich Airport.
This followed industrial action by pilots also at Frankfurt Airport and a strike last month by pilots working for 
Lufthansa's budget offshoot Germanwings.
Both Air France and Lufthansa are trying to cut costs to compete with the likes of Ryanair, Vueling and other budget

Lufthansa wants to scrap a retirement plan under which its 5,400 pilots can retire at 55 and continue to receive part

Air France wants to hire crews on smaller pay to build up its low-cost business at Transavia.
In both cases, the pilots are resisting the changes.
Air France pilots are demanding a single contract for all the group's pilots.

prompted thousands of job cuts.

Paris (Alliance News) - Air France said it had cancelled nearly half its scheduled flights Monday as pilots began a 
week-long strike.
Major disruptions are expected for the duration of the strike, which is expected to run from September 15 to 22.
Air France, which has warned passengers to rebook flights, estimates that the cost of the strike would range 
between 10 to 15 million euros (13 million to 19 million dollars).
The pilots' action was triggered by the company's plans to lower annual costs by more than a billion euros by 
transferring short- and medium-haul flights to low-budget subsidiary Transavia.
Air France-KLM has in recent years reacted to continuing losses by shedding thousands of jobs. The French-Dutch 
partnership has by hit from heavy competition from budget airlines such as easyJet, Ryanair and Vueling.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC's chief financial officer has said the low-cost carrier is flying six 
more passengers per flight in 2014 against last year, due to improvements in its customer service and the way the 
company sells tickets, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters in Dublin, Howard Millar said the group expects load factors to increase between 3 and 4 
percentage points to "close to 86%" of available seats this year.
An increase of that size on the company's fleet of Boeing 737s, which carry 189 passengers apiece, would mean 6 
to 7 more passenger a flight, Reuters said.
Executives from the carrier were speaking to reporters following its first delivery of up to 380 Boeing jets over the 
next decade which could increase Ryanair's total passenger numbers to 150 million per year from 82 million now.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Monday that it had inked a deal with The Boeing Co to buy 
up to 200 of its new 737 MAX aircraft in a deal worth up to USD22 billion at current list prices.
The new aircraft will feature 197 seats each, eight more than its existing 737-800 aircraft, and new engines which 
combined with aerodynamic improvements will reduce fuel consumption by up to 18% and operational noise 
emissions by 40%, Ryanair said.
Ryanair said savings would be passed on via lower fares to its customers.
The order will be Boeing's largest aircraft order from a European airline, the company said.
The order will expand Ryanair's fleet to 520 aircraft by 2024, it said, which will allow it to grow traffic to over 150 
million per year by 2024, compared to 82 million last year.
"These new "gamechanger" aircraft will allow Ryanair to lower our costs and airfares, while improving our customer 
experience with more leg room and the Boeing Sky Interior, as we roll out new offers, particularly for our Business 
Plus and Family Extra customers," said Chief Executive Michael O'Leary in a statement. 
Shares in Ryanair were trading down 0.9% at 7.48 pence Monday afternoon.

British banks struggled amid mounting speculation that Scotland will go its own way in a close vote.
Stocks slipped from last week's 2-month highs as Chinese growth concerns also weighed.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index was down 0.29%, trimming recent gains. Any exuberance over the European Central 
Bank's stimulus plan announced last week has fizzled out.
In Germany, the DAX was down 0.05%, London's FTSE 100 slipped 0.38% and the CAC 40 of France lost 0.31 
percnet.
Lloyds Banking, Standard Life and Royal Bank of Scotland were lower on worries over Scotland operations.
In major corporate news, General Electric (GE) announced an agreement to sell its GE appliances business to 
Electrolux for USD3.3 billion. The deal, which is approved by boards of both companies, is expected to close in 
2015. Electolux shares rose 4%.
Associated British Foods affirmed its full year earnings guidance, premised on strong operating performances by its 
grocery business and Primark. Shares were down 4.8%.

European Stocks Slide Ahead Of Scotland Independence Vote
On the economic front, the German Federal Statistical Office reported that the nation's trade surplus rose to 23.4 
billion euros in July, well ahead of the 17 billion euro surplus expected by economists, as year-over-year export 
growth accelerated to 8.5%, while imports unexpectedly fell.
The country's current account surplus also increased more than expected. A separate report showed that labor 
costs in Germany rose 1.7% year-over-year in the second quarter.

UPDATE: Lufthansa pilots strike, flights for 25,000 passengers cancelled

Frankfurt (Alliance News) - Pilots at German airline Lufthansa went on strike for six hours late on Friday, forcing the 
cancellation of more than 200 scheduled flights and disrupting travel for 25,000 passengers.
Vereinigung Cockpit, the pilots' labour union, has been in months of negotiations with the carrier over the terms of 
an early retirement scheme.
Its members were refusing short and medium-haul take-offs from Frankfurt Airport, Lufthansa's hub, until 11 pm 
(2100 GMT) Friday. Late-night departures are banned at Frankfurt, so operations were not set to resume until early 
Saturday.
Adding to transport snarls in Germany, a railway engineers' union, the GDL, announced Friday that its members 
would refuse to drive trains on Saturday from 6 am to 9 am as it pursues wage claims against the main rail 
company, Deutsche Bahn.
Lufthansa had been relying on main-line express trains to help clear some of the backlog from cancelled domestic 
flights.
The airline reserved 2,200 Frankfurt-area hotel rooms for stranded travellers and was setting up 500 camp beds 
inside the airport transit zone to accommodate any stranded passengers who lack visas to leave the airport and 
enter the city to stay at hotels.
Lufthansa said the stoppage would cost it "millions of euros" but refused to budge on the union's retirement plan 
claims.
The listed airline insists it must slash labour costs to remain competitive against both low-cost European carriers 
such as RyanAir and EasyJet and up-and-coming long-haul carriers such as Emirates and Etihad.
While union members refused to fly jets to German and European destinations out of Frankfurt, long-haul flights 
were not affected.
UPDATE: Lufthansa pilots strike, flights for 25,000 passengers cancelled
In response, Lufthansa scratched more than 200 flights from its Friday schedule, including Frankfurt-bound flights 
departing three or more hours earlier from other European capitals. The European network was completely 
grounded an hour before the strike began.
Lufthansa said the pre-emptive cancellations were necessary so that the airline could quickly resume normal 
services on Saturday.
Past strikes have left jets or crews stranded at the wrong airports, meaning disruptions continued even after the 
pilots ceased striking.
Lufthansa said it had sent out 14,000 text messages offering assistance to those passengers who had registered 
their mobile phone numbers with the airline. It offered rebookings on other dates, on other airlines or on trains for 
the shorter domestic connections.
Lufthansa criticized the union for striking on an end-of-summer weekend when thousands of families are flying 
home to Germany from vacations abroad and require onward domestic connections. School holidays end this 
weekend in three out of 16 German states.
"That is an especial disgrace," said airline spokesman Andreas Bartels on ZDF breakfast television.
The union is demanding full reinstatement of a benefit that formerly allowed pilots to choose early retirement at 60 
on partial pay. The airline wants to wind up the benefit so fit pilots keep flying until 65.
A week earlier, the same union held a six-hour strike that hit planes operated by Germanwings, a low-budget 
subsidiary of Lufthansa. That strike took down 116 out of 164 scheduled departures, affecting 15,000 passengers.
Germans have been divided in response to strikes. Strikers who complain about stagnant incomes after years of 
economic austerity in Germany often gain public support. However pilots, who are among the best-paid labour 
groups, have garnered much less public sympathy.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Budget carrier Ryanair Ltd is in advanced talks to acquire around 100 high-density 
versions of the Boeing Co 737 MAX jetliner in a deal worth up to USD10 billion and which could close within weeks, 
Reuters reported Friday, citing two people familiar with the matter.
The move comes around two months after Boeing said it was looking into plans to offer more seating in the 
upcoming 737 MAX by introducing a new version with 200 seats, 11 more than the standard version, Reuters said.
A deal for around 100 of those planes would be concluded as early as the middle of September, according to one of 
the sources, Reuters added.
A spokesman for Ryanair said the company "does not comment upon, or engage in, rumour or speculation". A 
spokesman for Boeing in Europe declined to comment on the rumour.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Wednesday said traffic and load factor both increased in August, 
attributing the rise to the launch of new family and business products.
The budget carrier said its traffic increased by 400,000 customers to 9.4 million in August, from 9.0  million a year 
earlier.
The company's load factor also improved from 89% to 93% over the year.
"The launch of our new family and business products have been extremely successful and have contributed 
significantly to these highest-ever load factors in Ryanair's history," said Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing 
officer.

Fastjet Launches Premium Fare Packages; One Targets Produce Traders

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost African airline fastjet PLC Friday launched a premium fare and a premium 
hold luggage package, part of a trend of low-cost airlines offering such services for an extra cost, although fastjet's 
reasoning for its new hold luggage package was highly relevant to the countries in which it operates.
Fastjet's new "SmartClass" premium fare package will allow passengers to upgrade to a fare starting at USD160 
one way on domestic flights and USD450 on international routes in return for being able to choose seats in 
advance, an increased baggage allowance of up to 32 kilograms, and the ability to change flight dates as many 
times as needed at no extra cost.
The new fare, which excludes government taxes on tickets, is a big mark up from the airline's usual fare. When it 
launched flights between Tanzania and Zimbabwe earlier this month, it said tickets would start from as little as 
USD50 one-way, excluding taxes. 
The new SmartClass service will start September 1.
"By creating SmartClass we can provide additional flexibility and quick disembarkation from the front rows" Chief 
Commercial Officer Richard Bodin said in a statement.
It has already started offering its new "freighty" service, which allows passengers to carry up to 80 kilogrammes of 
hold luggage for an extra USD80.  
Fastjet said the move was designed for passengers who fly with fastjet to either collect or buy wholesale produce 
from the port and markets in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to sell in their home markets. It discovered traders were 
using fastjet to travel to Dar es Salaam, but using ground transportation to get back home, sometimes involving a 
bus journey taking several days.
Freighty is "a simple product enhancement, which is easy to administer and will allow passengers to benefit from 
the large capacity of our aircrafts" said Bodin. 
Fastjet Launches Premium Fare Packages; One Targets Produce Traders
Fastjet's move comes as low-cost carriers across Europe have started adding premium services to their basic 
offering in an attempt to attract more profitable business travelers. Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost 
airline, earlier this week said it will launch a new business class service offering features like premium seats, priority 
boarding and flexible tickets, an attempt to catch up with rival easyJet PLC which has seen a big increase in 
business travel since the financial crisis.
Fastjet shares were down 2.0% at 1.20 pence Friday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost carrier by passenger numbers, 
Wednesday said it will launch new routes from London Stansted and Dublin airports next summer, and will also 
launch a new business class service offering features like premium seats, priority boarding and flexible tickets.
More business travelers have been using low-cost airlines since the financial crisis, and Ryanair has been slow to 
pick up on the trend. It is now playing catch-up to rivals like easyJet, which has been flying higher numbers of 
business passengers after offering unlimited free date changes, fast-track security and upfront seats.
Irish airline Ryanair, which thinks about a quarter of its customers are flying on business trips, Wednesday said its 
new Business Plus package will offer flexibility on ticket changes, a 20 kilogram check-in baggage allowance, fast 
track airport security, priority boarding and premium seats, matching the easyJet package. 
The move comes after Ryanair in May admitted it had been annoying its customers with poor service, and 
introduced measures like allocated seating and relaxed cabin baggage and booking restrictions.
Ryanair also announced its summer 2015 flight schedules for London Stansted and Dublin airport, saying it will fly 
three new routes from each. It will fly to Cologne, Edinburgh and Glasgow International from Stansted - meaning it 
now has 134 routes from the airport - and more flights and "improved schedules" on 24 other routes. It will fly to 
Brussels Zaventem, Cologne and Glasgow International from Dublin - meaning it has 81 routes from Dublin in total - 
as well as putting more flights and improved on 12 other routes.
Ryanair shares were up 3.0% at EUR7.15 Wednesday morning.

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - European stocks were unable to extend recent gains on Wednesday following more 
downbeat consumer news out of Germany, the region's economic engine.
An afternoon rally fizzled out, leaving most European averages little changed from the previous session.
With much of Europe "out of the office" on vacation, there were few corporate headlines to digest.
A survey conducted by market research group GfK found German consumer sentiment is set to drop in September. 
The forward-looking consumer confidence index fell to 8.6 from a revised score of 8.9 in August. The index was 
expected to drop marginally to 8.9 from August's initially estimated value of 9.
Meanwhile, Germany's import prices declined at a faster rate in July, more than the consensus estimate, a report 
from the statistical office Destatis showed.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks eased 0.15%, but are up 3.55% from a week ago.
The German DAX was down 0.2%, while the French CAC 40, Switzerland's SMI and the UK's FTSE 100 were 
virtually unchanged
In stock action, LEG Immobilien rose 0.85%. The stock was cut to "Equalweight" from "Overweight" at Morgan 
Stanley.
Infineon gained around 1%. Credit Suisse initiated the stock with an "Outperform" rating.
OneSavings Bank jumped 6.4%, after reporting increased profit for the first half.
Ryanair, which launched its London Stansted Summer 2015 schedule, added 3.7%.
Foxtons Group dropped 10%. The real estate agent expects the growth in transaction volumes in the second half to 
slow from the rapid rate seen in the first half.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC will bid for the Cypriot national airline Cyprus Airways, the chief 
marketing officer for Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Kenny Jacobs, told BBC Radio Wednesday. 
Jacobs said Ryanair will submit a proposal to acquire the state-controlled airline before Friday's bid deadline, and 
the company had a positive meeting with the airline and the Cypriot government last week.
The BBC reported that the Cypriot authorities say they expect to get about 15 different proposals, and a new owner 
should be announced by the beginning of October.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, is to travel to Cyprus today 
to hold talks with the country's government about a possible takeover bid for loss-making Cyprus Airways Public 
Ltd, Reuters reported Thursday.
Speaking at a news conference in Dublin, O'Leary said Ryanair is "engaged in the process" and said the company 
"hopes something will come of it." He added it was a "very political situation" in Cyprus and said any deal would be 
small relative to the budget carrier's overall growth strategy.
O'Leary comments mark a change of approach for Ryanair, after he last month said the company was not 
particularly interested in buying the Cypriot carrier, Reuters said.
Ryanair was one of nearly 20 companies which submitted non-binding expressions of interest in the airline last 
month.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airlines easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC Wednesday reported rises in 
traffic and load factors for July.
FTSE 100-listed easyJet said it flew 6.4 million passengers during the month, up 7.7% on the 6.0 million 
passengers flown in July last year. Load factor - the measure of how full its seats were - also rose during the month, 
up 1.3% to 92.9% from 91.6% in 2013.
On a rolling 12-month basis, the airline said passenger numbers to July 2014 were up 5.9% to 63.8 million, from 
60.3 million recorded in July last year. Load factor for the 12-month period was also up, coming in at 90.2% from 
89.1% in July 2013.
In July easyJet said that revenue, passenger numbers and load factor increased in the third quarter as the low-cost 
airline benefited from the timing of Easter as well as good progress in its digital, brand and revenue initiatives. The 
airline said total revenue for the third quarter to June 30, 2014 rose 8.6% to GBP1.24 billion from GBP1.14 billion 
last year.
Budget airline Ryanair said Wednesday that traffic in July rose 4% to 9.15 million passengers from the 8.84 million 
flown in July last year, while load factor was 3% higher at 91% from 88% in July 2013.
The company also said that rolling annual traffic rose 4% to 83 million customers.
Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs attributed the growth to lower fares and an improving customer 
experience, "including our great new website and mobile app, allocated seating, a free 2nd small carry-on bag and 
PED use on all flights."
Last week Ryanair said that the timing of a very strong Easter boosted its first quarter results as it reported higher 
revenue and pretax profit for the period, leading the company to "cautiously" raise its full-year profit after tax 
guidance. The low-cost airline said that in its first quarter to June 30, revenue rose 11% to EUR1.50 billion from

EUR1.34 billion in the comparable quarter year. Pretax profit came in at EUR223.6million for the quarter, compared

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair shares rose Monday after the airline reported first quarter results ahead of 
consensus forecasts, but the results were helped to some extent by the timing of Easter and both Ryanair 
management and analysts emphasise caution on the outlook for the rest of the year.
Ryanair shares were quoted up 4.0% at EUR7.123 midday Monday.
The Irish-listed low-cost airline said that in its first quarter to June 30, revenue rose 11% to EUR1.50 billion, from 
EUR1.34 billion in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Pretax profit also jumped to EUR223.6 million, compared 
with EUR88.5 million. The results come after Ryanair's recent roll-out of initiatives like a new mobile app and a new-
look web-site.
"Instant analysis of Ryanair’s first-quarter figures would suggest that European travellers are a forgiving bunch, and 
have quickly taken to the new "friendly cuddly" airline," said IG markets analyst Alastair McCaig.
Liberum Capital analyst Gerald Khoo says that both revenue and costs were better than forecast, with the cost 
outperformance slightly greater than the revenue beat. However, the analyst says that the strong top line was 
helped by the timing of Easter, which fell entirely in the first quarter this year, compared with last year when it was 
split between the fourth quarter and the first quarter.
The strong revenue performance was driven by better load factors and better yields, says Khoo. Ryanair 
demonstrated constrained capacity growth in the the first half, keeping it broadly flat. However, accelerating 
capacity growth in the second half is likely to put downward pressure on yields later in the year, the analyst says. 
Indeed, Ryanair has flagged faster capacity growth for the second half than previously planned, now targeting 8% 
growth to take advantage of growth discounts offered by airports.
Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary cautioned investors against any "irrational exuberance" in what 
continues to be a difficult economic environment, with some company-specific challenges in the second half".
IN THE KNOW: Ryanair Takes Off But Capacity Growth May Squeeze Second Half
The airline did increased its full year net profit guidance to EUR620 to EUR650 million. However, at EUR646 
million, the consensus estimate has already anticipated this. "There may be some temptation for consensus to 
continue to aim above guidance," says analyst Khoo.
Ryanair trades on an estimated 2014 full year price-to-earnings ratio of 14.7 times. That represents a 40% premium 
to easyJet, which can be partially justified by the continued positive earnings momentum, but material upgrades 
would be required to justify a positive stance, says Liberum's Khoo. Liberum therefore reiterates a Hold rating, with 
a price target of EUR7.10.

Easter Timing Boosts Ryanair 's First Quarter, Full-Year Guidance

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Monday that the timing of a very strong Easter boosted its 
first quarter results as it reported higher revenue and pretax profit for the period, leading the company to 
"cautiously" raise its full-year profit after tax guidance. 
The low-cost airline said that in its first quarter to June 30, revenue rose 11% to EUR1.50 billion from EUR1.34 
billion in the comparable quarter year. Pretax profit also jumped, coming in at EUR223.6million, compared to 
EUR88.5 million in 2013.
Ryanair said it flew 24.3 million passengers during the period, up 4% on the 23.2 million flown in the comparative 
year as load factors rose 4% to 86% for the quarter. 
While encouraged by the increases, the company cautioned Monday that its results were "distorted by the timing of 
a very strong Easter in Q1 with no holiday period in the prior year comparable."
Also boosted by the Easter period, average fare rose 9%, and ancillary revenues were 4% higher, in line with traffic 
growth, as airport and baggage fee reductions were offset by the rising uptake of allocated seating, said the 
company.
Ryanair said its new bases at Athens, Brussels, Lisbon and Rome are performing strongly and that its strategy to 
raise forward bookings continues to drive higher load factors. The company said it expects to release its summer 
2015 schedule in mid-September, some three months earlier than last year.
Looking ahead Ryanair said that is on track to deliver a strong first-half, during which traffic will grow by 3%, and 
fares will rise by 6% subject to late booking fares in August and September, it said, though warned that it continues 
to operate in a difficult economic environment, and expects to face some company-specific challenges in its 
second-half.
Easter Timing Boosts Ryanair 's First Quarter, Full-Year Guidance
"We expect H2 to be characterised by a much softer pricing environment as many competitors are lowering fares, 
partly in response to Ryanair's strong forward bookings... We continue to expect H2 yields to fall by between 6% to 
8% which will result in full year yields rising by only 2%," said CEO Michael O'Leary.
The company now expects full-year traffic to rise by 5% to 86 million, and subsequently the company has 
"cautiously" raised its full-year profit after tax guidance from the previous range EUR580 million to EUR620 million 
to a range of EUR620 million to EUR650 million.  
"However this guidance, which is about a 21% rise over last year's net profit, is heavily, reliant upon the final outturn 
for H2 yields over which we currently have zero visibility," added O'Leary.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UK stocks made a soft start to the week Monday, with investors focused on individual 
company updates, leaving indices trading in a tight range for most of the day amid dearth of overall market drivers.
The FTSE 100 has closed fractionally lower at 6,788.07, the FTSE 250 has closed down 0.5% at 15,616.53, and 
the AIM All-Share down 0.2% at 771.69.
Afternoon press reports that EU leaders may be close to agreeing sector-wide, or "tier-three", sanctions against 
Russia for its part in the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 send equity markets across Europe to session 
lows, but investors were broadly reluctant to take significant positions ahead of some bigger economic and 
corporate updates to come later in the week, including the the Federal Reserve policy meeting and the monthly US 
jobs report.
Within European majors, the German DAX 30 ended down 0.5%, while the French CAC 40 closed up 0.3%.
After the European market close, US stocks are continuing lower, with the DJIA down 0.2%, the S&P 500 down 
0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.4%.
"I think there's very little enthusiasm to get overly long equities ahead of this week's US data and that's lent a slight 
negative bias to proceedings today," said CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson.
In London, Reckitt Benckiser was the best FTSE 100 performer, closing up 3.0% after reporting strong first half 
results and saying it plans to spin-off its US-based pharmaceutical business within the next 12 months. The 
consumer goods company reported first half profit of GBP1.04 billion, up from GBP898 million in the first half of last 
year. Analysts say the results were driven by a better-than-expected performance from the pharmaceutical 
business, which bodes well for the the plans for it to de-merge and list in the UK in its own right.
MARKET COMMENT: UK Stocks End Lower In Quiet Start To Busy Week
Ryanair shares gained 2.6% after reporting first quarter results ahead of consensus forecasts. The Irish-listed low-
cost airline said that in its first quarter to June 30, revenue rose 11% to EUR1.50 billion from EUR1.34 billion in the 
comparable quarter a year earlier. Pretax profit also jumped to EUR223.6 million, compared with EUR88.5 million. 
Analysts in part attributed the strong performance to the timing of Easter, which fell entirely in the first quarter this 
year, compared to last year when it was split between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. 
EasyJet shares enjoyed a small read across, closing up 0.9%.
Aberdeen Asset Management weighed on the other end of the FTSE 100, ending down 5.4% after saying its assets 
under management fell by 0.6% in its third quarter, hit by a GBP4.0 billion withdrawal by a single client, as well as 
worse-than-expected outflows across various products. Aberdeen said its assets fell to GBP322.5 billion at the end 
of June from GBP324.5 billion at the end of March. Management said that most of the lost assets were low margin, 
but even so analysts expect consensus forecasts to be downgraded by between 2% to 4% as a result of the lost 
business.
Royal Bank of Scotland saw a little profit taking in its shares following their 11% rise on Friday when the bank 
surprised the market with an unscheduled release of unexpectedly strong results. RBS closed down 3.3% Monday.
Lloyds shares remained little changed despite being hit with a GBP218 million fine from US and UK authorities for 
its part in the manipulation of the LIBOR and Sterling Repo Rate, making it the latest in a long list of financial 
institutions to have agreed settlements over past misconduct in relation to benchmarks. Lloyds shares took the fine 
in their stride, closing just fractionally higher Monday.
A broadly positive US second-quarter earnings season has been providing support to equity valuations in recent 
sessions, and following a lull in proceedings Monday they are set to come back into focus Tuesday, with the release 
of results from big names including Pfizer and Twitter, while the UK earnings season also builds to a peak.
Full-year results are due Tuesday from PZ Cussons, while interim results are due from Domino's Pizza, Drax 
Group, GKN, Tullett Prebon, and St James's Place. Quarterly numbers are due from BP and Next.
The fact that about 75% of US names have beaten expectations so far has also raised expectations for the big US 
economic releases to come this week, starting with the consumer confidence index on Tuesday and culminating in 
the July non-farm payroll report on Friday.
"The match really kicks off tomorrow for markets with the release of the US consumer confidence report and results 
from the likes of BP and Twitter," said CMC Markets market analyst Jasper Lawler.
UK mortgage approvals data will provide the domestic economic focus Tuesday, due at 0930 BST along with other 
consumer credit and net lending data from the Bank of England. Ahead of that Bank of England Deputy Governor 
Ben Broadbent is scheduled to speak in London at 0800 BST.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
midday Monday.
-------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
-------
Reckitt Benckiser Group, up 2.7%. The consumer goods and healthcare company's shares have risen after 
reporting a first half profit of GBP1.04 billion, up from GBP898 million in the first half of last year. The results were 
driven by a better-than-expected performance from the group's pharmaceutical business, RBP, for which 
management has announced plans for a UK listing, expected over the coming year, as a conclusion to Reckitt's 
strategic review.
British Sky Broadcasting Group, up 2.6%. The broadcaster's shares are rebounding, having ended Friday as the 
blue-chip index's biggest loser, closing down 5.5% at 874.50 pence. The company's shares fell sharply on Friday 
after it said it will acquire 21st Century Fox Inc's holdings in Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland for a total of GBP4.9 
billion in cash, plus BSkyB's 21% stake in the National Geographic Channel, and also reported a fall in pretax profit 
in the year to the end of June. To part-fund the acquisitions, BSkyB placed 156.1 million shares, representing 
around 9.99% of its existing share capital. The shares were placed at 870 pence each, BSkyB said, raising a total 
of GBP1.36 billion. On Monday, the company said it has made a USD400,000 investments in California-based 
early-stage technology company Jaunt Inc. The investment follows a USD350,000 equity investment that BSkyB 
previously made in the company during an earlier round of funding in December 2013. Also on Monday, Nomura 
raised BSkyB to Neutral from Reduce, according to traders.
EasyJet, up 1%. The low-cost airline has seen its share price rise after Irish rival Ryanair Holdings revealed that the 
timing of a very strong Easter boosted its first quarter results, as it reported higher revenue and pretax profit for the 
period, leading the company to raise its full-year profit after tax guidance. In a trading update for the first quarter to 
UK WINNERS & LOSERS: Costly Single Withdrawal Hits Aberdeen
end-June, Ryanair said revenue rose 11% to EUR1.50 billion, up from the EUR1.34 billion posted in the 
comparable quarter last year. Pretax profit also jumped, coming in at EUR223.6million, compared to EUR88.5 
million in 2013. Subsequently, the company has "cautiously" raised its full-year profit after tax guidance to a range 
of EUR620 million to EUR650 million from the previous range EUR580 million to EUR620 million. Ryanair shares 
are up 4.1%.
-------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
-------
Aberdeen Asset Management, down 3.1%. The asset manager's shares have moved firmly lower after it said its 
assets under management fell by 0.6% in its third quarter, hit by a GBP4.0 billion withdrawal by a single client of 
low-margin assets under management from its Asia Pacific and global equities strategies. It did not name the client, 
but said assets under management fell to GBP322.5 billion at the end of June from GBP324.5 billion at the end of 
March. Net outflows from the main business, recently acquired Scottish Widows Investment Partnership, and 
negative foreign exchange movements were in the main compensated for by positive investment performance in 
the quarter.
Royal Bank of Scotland Group, down 2.6%. The bank's shares are firmly lower, following material increases posted 
on Friday. RBS ended Friday as the biggest gainer in the blue-chip index, closing up 11%, after it said it expects to 
report a near doubling in first-half pretax profit, driven by a turnaround in impairments due to improving credit 
conditions in the UK and Ireland, and the performance of the part of the bank tasked with running down assets that 
require especially high levels of capital. Monday's losses come despite a raft of positive broker recommendation 
and price target revisions. UBS has upgraded the company to Neutral from Sell, increasing its price target to 378 
pence from 320p, while JP Morgan Cazenove has upgraded the company to Neutral from Underweight, Credit 
Suisse has increased its price target on the bank to 310 pence from 280p, Deutsche Bank has raised its target to 
335 pence from 325p, and Citigroup has lifted its target to 330 pence from 300p.
-------
FTSE 250 - WINNERS
-------
Debenhams, up 4.2%. The high-street department store chain said it has appointed Mothercare's chief financial 
officer, Matt Smith, as its own CFO. Smith will also join the retailer's board upon his appointment. He had served as 
CFO at Mothercare only since 2013 and before this held a number of finance positions at Home Retail. Debenhams 
said Smith will join "upon the satisfaction of his existing contractual obligations."
Petra Diamonds, up 2.5%. The diamond miner reported a 17% increase in revenue in its last financial year, as 
production also rose 17% to 3.1 million carats from 2.7 million carats a year earlier, above market guidance of 3 
million carats. The company said revenue rose to USD472.6 million in the year, from USD402.7 million a year 
earlier. It said it experienced a firmer diamond market in the second half, with rough diamond prices achieved by 
Petra either in line with or above full-year guidance. It said costs remained well controlled despite ongoing 
inflationary pressures experienced in the mining industry, specifically rising costs for labour and electricity. Capital 
expenditure rose to USD210.0 million, from USD191.2 million a year earlier. Financially, Petra said it had USD33.3 
million in cash at the bank at the year-end, compared with USD26.2 million a year earlier.
-------
FTSE 250 - LOSERS
-------
Cranswick, down 1.8%. After jumping almost 3% at the UK equity market open to close to its 52-week high, the 
food producer's shares now trade firmly lower, even though it said it has seen a good start to the new financial year, 
with revenue growth in the first quarter, while overall trading has been in line with expectations. Revenue in the 
three months to end-June was 5% ahead of the same period last year, reflecting continued growth across most 
product categories, the pork products supplier said, and "trading so far in the current financial year has been in line 
with the board's expectations," it added.

Frontier Mining, up 15%. The company said that it has received approval from the Ministry of Industry and New 
Technology in Kazakhstan to proceed with the sale of its Naimanjal licence area to Union Transnationale Miniere 
SA. Regulatory approval comes after the copper production, exploration and development company in March 
unveiled an agreement to sell subsidiary FML Kazakhstan LLP, the owner of the Naimanjal licence area, to UTM for 
USD30 million in cash. Frontier Mining expects to use the proceeds to repay maturing debt and to finance capital 
expenditure for the ramp up of copper production at Benkala to maximum levels.
Stadium Group, up 13%. The company said it has acquired specialist electronics designer and manufacturer United 
Wireless for up to GBP8 million in cash and shares. It said the acquisition is expected to "significantly" add to 
earnings in its first full year of ownership and will compliment its existing technologies, presenting growth 
opportunities and synergies. It expects that in the current year the acquisition will make a small contribution to 
profits. It will pay an initial consideration of GBP6.0 million, of which GBP5.0 million will be in cash and GBP1.0 
million from the issue of 1.5 million new shares. It will pay for the cash portion using a new five-year facility of up to 
GBP5 million provided by its existing banking partner HSBC Holdings. Stadium will make an additional earn-out 
payment of up to GBP1.3 million in shares and GBP660,000 in loan notes if United Wireless exceeds certain 
defined earn-out targets.
Legendary Investments, up 8.4%. The investment company said it swung to a full-year profit after reporting a 
significant increase in net gains on investments. It said that it made a GBP901,000 profit in the year to end-March, 
compared with a GBP158,000 loss a year earlier. Legendary's net gain on investments increased to GBP1.1 million 
from GBP38,000. Administrative costs increased to GBP214,000 from GBP196,000. Net assets increased to 
GBP1.5 million from GBP554,000. Chairman Zafar Karim said the investment company is pleased with its results, 
adding that they demonstrate Legendary's ability to source, invest in, and proactively add value to investments with 
potential for capital appreciation.
Snoozebox Holdings, up 7.5%. The portable hotel provider said it has significantly reduced its losses in the first half 
of the year, supported by a successful events programme, while saying it has a strong pipeline of opportunities. It 
said it expects to report an improvement in pre-exceptional earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortisation for the six months to end-June, while it expects to reduce its losses to GBP1.6 million in the period, 
compared with GBP4.2 million the prior year, supported by a GBP1.7 million reduction in administrative expenses 
and central overhead costs. It said it is expecting revenue of GBP0.7 million for the first half. The company said it 
will release its interim results on September 30.
-------
AIM ALL-SHARE - LOSERS
-------
Broca, off 32%. After jumping at the UK equity market open, the company's shares have since fallen sharply and 
are now the biggest fallers in the AIM All-Share index. The drop comes after the company resumed trading on AIM 
and said it was convening an annual general meeting August 12 to approve the reverse takeover of MXC Capital 
Advisory LLP. Shareholders will be called on to approve the reverse takeover, the placing of 850.0 million shares at 
1 pence per share, and the change in its name to MXC Capital PLC. Broca said that if the placing and acquisition 
complete, it will seek to generate shareholder returns by providing corporate finance advisory services to grow 
businesses in which it makes investments. Broca's shares are currently quoted at 1.60 pence.
Tangiers Petroleum, down 27%. The oil and gas explorer said it has failed to find hydrocarbons at the Tao-1 
exploration well off the Moroccan Atlantic coast, at its secondary target. The company holds a participating interest 
in the Moroccan Tarfaya Offshore Block, which is operated by Galp Energia with a 50% interest. It said that, based 
on its current available information, it has failed to find hydrocarbons at the Assaka secondary target in the well but 
a full petrophysical evaluation of the Assaka objective is still to take place. Tangiers said that drilling operations 
continue at the Tao-1 exploration well towards its primary and largest objective, the Trident formation. It added that 
the possible success at Trident is not linked to the results from Assaka.

Forbidden Technologies, down 12%. The company, which develops and operates cloud video-editing platform 
ForScene, has posted a widened pretax loss of GBP1.2 million for the six months to end-June, widened from 
GBP189,618 in the previous year, as revenue declined to GBP348,077 from GBP401,278, but administrative 
expenses nearly tripled as it upped its headcount and set up its new US subsidiary. Some GBP184,000 was spent 
on setting up and staffing the US subsidiary.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Wednesday said it plans to appeal against the EU Commission's 
ruling that it should repay almost EUR10 million relating to state aid for several of its French regional airports. 
The Commission found that the budget airline did not comply with EU state aid rules and had enjoyed "an undue 
advantage." It ordered Ryanair to repay EUR868,000 related to rebates and marketing arrangements negotiated at 
Augouleme airport in central France. 
In a statement, the Commission said the airline should repay the money so as to "remove the distortion of 
competition." Similar findings at Pau Pyrenees airport required a repayment of EUR2.4 million, with EUR6.4 million 
repayable at Nimes airport, said the Commission.
However, Ryanair opposed the ruling, stating that "All of Ryanair's airport arrangements comply with the EU State 
aid rules and Ryanair has therefore instructed its lawyers to appeal these rulings to the extent they erroneously 
allege otherwise."
The Commission said it is continuing to investigate Austria's Klagenfurt airport where the airport services and 
market agreements "appeared to be excessively favourable to Ryanair and therefore could involve incompatible 
state aid."
The Commission found no problems, however, with three German regional airports. Ryanair  Wednesday said it 
welcomed these positive findings.
Ryanair shares were quoted down 0.7% at 6.91 pence Wednesday afternoon.

LONDON (Alliance News) - A number of recent profit warnings from European airlines have made investing in them 
more precarious, but there is still opportunity in the sector, with the UK listings being amongst the best placed in 
Europe, says Jefferies.
Over the last month, a profit warning from German flag carrier Lufthansa, followed by one earlier this week from Air 
France-KLM has sent London airline stocks into free fall, with both British Airways parent International Consolidated 
Airlines Group and easyJet losing more than 20% since the Lufthansa update on June 11.
Jefferies has lowered some of its price targets to reflect the recent recent weakness, but reiterates Buy ratings on 
IAG, easyJet, and Ryanair.
The Air France-KLM warning was largely about over capacity on its long haul routes, leading the market to worry 
about IAG, which is not immune from the pricing pressure of the industry capacity expansion.
However, Jefferies believes the group will deliver a solid second-quarter update on August 1 and a reiteration of 
guidance will be enough to support the shares, given the recent collapse of sector confidence.
One reason for IAG to outperform the groups that have recently issues warnings is that Heathrow, IAG's main 
airport, is less reliant on transfer traffic than the Lufthansa and Air France-KLM hubs of Frankfurt and Paris, 
respectively, says Jefferies.
"Structurally, we feel that IAG has a relatively strong position, providing some insulation against industry 
challenges," says Jefferies analyst Mark Irvine-Fortescue.
Jefferies has lowered its price target on IAG to 480p from 541p. The stock is amongst the best FTSE 100 
performers early Friday, up 0.9% at 334.80p.
IN THE KNOW: Jefferies Sees Post-Warning Opportunity In UK Airlines
Amongst the low cost carriers, Ryanair is Jefferies' sector pick. Summer trading is buoyant with signs that 
commercial changes are helping, the bank says. Indeed, Ryanair expects to increase its average fare by 6% in the 
first half of 2015.
England's early exit from the World Cup could help bookings amongst the low-cost European carriers, says 
Jefferies. Moreover, French air traffic control strikes in June were called off, although the disruption did lead to the 
cancellation of about 240 Ryanair flights.
Jefferies says that the recent roll-out of self-help initiatives such as a new website, allocated seating, and reduced 
fees and charges are what is making the airline more appealing. Moreover, Ryanair's recent maiden bond issue 
was more than eight times oversubscribed, which reflects the strength of the groups financial standing, the bank 
says.
"In a tough competitive environment, Ryanair's self-help levers are appealing," says analyst Irvine-Fortescue. 
Jefferies has maintained its price target on Ryanair at EUR8.0. The stock trades higher early Friday, up 1.9% at 
EUR6.78.
Fellow low-cost carrier easyJet poses "a bit of a conundrum," says Jefferies. A more mature business means there 
are fewer quick-wins to be had and therefore a less exciting near term outlook than the market has been used to. 
Jefferies is forecasting revenue per seat growth of 4% in the third-quarter, dropping to 3% in the fourth-quarter.
"The growth outlook does not look as exciting as it has in the past. We think this has been enough for some 
investors to take profit," says Fortescue.
However, while the growth outlook is a little lower than Ryanair's, easyJet reported a high load factor of about 90% 
in its recent traffic statistics update, which Jefferies says gives confidence in its estimates.
Jefferies has lowered its price target on easyJet to 1,500p from 1,800p. The stock was trading higher early Friday, 
up 0.9% at 1,284.00p.
Both the low-cost carriers have enjoyed years of "super-normal" growth without serious competition. However, it is 
too simple to say that because they have matured, the investment case has run out of steam, says Jefferies. "The 
recent pull back feels overdone to us, and we expect the shares to move back up over the next 12 months, hence 
our Buy rating," the bank says.

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - After coming under pressure in early trading on Monday, stocks have seen some 
further downside over the course of the session. The losses on the day are partly offsetting the strong performance 
that was shown by the markets last week.
The weakness on Wall Street is partly due to profit taking, with some traders cashing in on the recent strength in the 
markets.
Electronic storage stocks have shown a significant move to the downside over the course of the session, dragging 
the NYSE Arca Disk Drive Index down by 1.7%. The index is pulling back off the three-month closing high set last 
Thursday.
Hutchinson Technology (HTCH) has helped to lead the storage sector lower, with the maker of disk drive 
components tumbling by 3.4%.
Considerable weakness is also visible among airline stocks, as reflected by the 1.6% loss being posted by the 
NYSE Arca Airline Index. Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) and Republic Airways (RJET) are posting notable losses.
Brokerage stocks are also giving back ground following recent strength, with the NYSE Arca Broker/Dealer Index 
falling by 1.4% after ending the previous session at a three-month closing high.
Oil service, biotechnology, and housing stocks have also come under pressure on the day, moving lower along with 
most of the other major sectors.
Currently, the major averages are posting notable losses, near their lows for the session. The Dow is down 64.25 
points or 0.4% at 17,004.01, the Nasdaq is down 32.29 points or 0.7% at 4,453.63 and the S&P 500 is down 9.39

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - While trading activity was somewhat subdued following the long holiday weekend, 
stocks moved mostly lower during trading on Monday. The losses on the day partly offset the strong performance 
that was shown by the markets last week.
Most of the major sectors moved to the downside on the day, although substantial weakness was visible among 
airline stocks. The NYSE Arca Airline Index tumbled by 2.3%, moving toward the low end of a recent trading range.
Delta (DAL), Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY), and American Airlines (AAL) turned in some of the airline sector's worst 
performances.
Biotechnology stocks also showed a significant move to the downside over the course of the session, dragging the 
NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index down by 2.1%. The drop by the index came after it ended the previous session at 
a four-month closing high.
Considerable weakness also emerged among natural gas stocks, as reflected by the 1.7% loss posted by the 
NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index. The weakness in the sector came as natural gas for August delivery fell USD0.181 
to USD4.225 per million BTUs.
Housing, gold, electronic storage, and internet stocks also moved notably lower on the day, reflecting broad based 
selling pressure.
The major averages ended the day firmly in negative territory but off their lows for the session. The Dow fell 44.05 
points or 0.3% to 17,024.21, the Nasdaq slid 34.40 points or 0.8% to 4,451.53 and the S&P 500 dropped 7.79 
points or 0.4% to 1,977.65.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airlines easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC said Friday that passenger 
numbers in June continued to rise.
FTSE 100-listed easyJet said it flew 6.1 million passengers in June, up 10.1% on the 5.5 million passengers flown 
in June last year. Load factor also rose during the month, rising to 92.0% from 89.9% in the comparable month. 
On a rolling 12 month basis, the airline said passenger numbers to June 2014 were up 5.4% to 63.4 million, from 
60.2 million recorded in June last year. Load factor for the 12-month period was also up, coming in at 90.1% from 
89.2% in June 2013. 
EasyJet noted that it cancelled 380 flights in June 2014 compared to the 585 flights cancelled in June 2013. The 
cancellations in June of this year were predominantly driven by the French Air Traffic Control strike on 24-25 June, 
said the company.
Ryanair said Friday that traffic in June rose to 8.3 million passengers, compared to the 7.9 million flown in June last 
year, while load factor rose to 88% from 84% for the comparable month. 
Rolling annual traffic rose to 82.7 million customers, a 3% rise.
Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs said June's growth can be attributed to "lower fares and improving 
customer experience, including our great new website, allocated seating, a free 2nd small carry-on bag and PED 
use on all flights."

LONDON (Alliance News) - Low-cost airlines easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings PLC and Aer Lingus Group PLC said 
Friday that passenger numbers in June continued to rise.
FTSE 100-listed easyJet said it flew 6.1 million passengers in June, up 10.1% on the 5.5 million passengers flown 
in June last year. Load factor also rose during the month, rising to 92.0% from 89.9% in the comparable month. 
On a rolling 12 month basis, the airline said passenger numbers to June 2014 were up 5.4% to 63.4 million, from 
60.2 million recorded in June last year. Load factor for the 12-month period was also up, coming in at 90.1% from 
89.2% in June 2013. 
EasyJet noted that it cancelled 380 flights in June 2014 compared to the 585 flights cancelled in June 2013. The 
cancellations in June of this year were predominantly driven by the French Air Traffic Control strike on 24-25 June, 
said the company.
Ryanair said Friday that traffic in June rose to 8.3 million passengers, compared to the 7.9 million flown in June last 
year, while load factor rose to 88% from 84% for the comparable month. 
Rolling annual traffic rose to 82.7 million customers, a 3% rise.
Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs said June's growth can be attributed to "lower fares and improving 
customer experience, including our great new website, allocated seating, a free 2nd small carry-on bag and PED 
use on all flights."
Aer Lingus also reported boosted passenger numbers for June, flying 995,000 passengers during the month, up 
from 949,000 in June 2013, up 4.9%. Traffic measured in revenue passenger kilometres rose 10.7% to 1.7 billion, 
from 1.6 billion last year, boosted by a 26.7% rise in long haul RPKs.
Load factor during the month declined, however, coming in at 85.5% from 86.2% last year.
UPDATE: EasyJet , Ryanair , Aer Lingus Passengers Numbers Continue Ascent In June
During the year-to-date, Aer Lingus said it has flown 4.62 million passengers, up from 4.57 million in the 
comparable period in June 2013.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UK stocks are trading mixed Friday amid low volumes, with indices looking unlikely to 
make any significant moves, as a US holiday truncates what has been a record week for global equities.
By mid-morning Friday the FTSE 100 is fractionally lower at 6,861.25, while the FTSE 250 is up 0.2% at 16,063.11, 
and the AIM All-Share is marginally higher at 790.65.
Within European markets, the French CAC 40 and the German DAX is are both about 0.1% lower.
The FTSE 100 continues to trade at a near-four-week high, having rallied there on Thursday in the wake of some 
impressive employment data from the US. The non-farm payroll report showed that the US economy added 
288,000 jobs in June, exceeding the consensus expectation and giving home to markets and investors that the US 
is experiencing a strong bounce back from its winter slump. 
The leading UK index has run out of momentum for now, however, along with others in Europe, as a light data 
calendar and US Independence Day is leaving traders in London to contemplate the sunny weather and a big 
weekend of sport ahead, including Friday's World Cup clash between France and Germany and Wimbledon semi 
finals.
Airlines are leading the blue-chip gainers, with easyJet up 2.9% and British Airways owner International 
Consolidated Airlines up 1.6%, following some strong passenger statistics from easyJet and Ryanair.
easyJet said it flew 6.1 million passengers in June, up 10.1% on the 5.5 million passengers flown in June last year. 
The load factor also rose during the month, rising to 92.0% from 89.9% in the comparable month. 
Ryanair said traffic in June rose to 8.3 million passengers, compared to the 7.9 million flown in June last year, while 
load factor rose to 88% from 84% for the comparable month.  Ryanair shares are off 0.6%.
MARKET COMMENT: FTSE Holds Near 3-Week High Amid Low Volume
The euro is a little softer against other major currencies after some disappointing German economic data that 
showed factory orders falling by 1.7% in the month of May, while on a yearly basis growth slowed to 5.5% from 
6.3% in April. 
The single currency trades at USD1.3590 and GBP0.7925. The pound is also a little softer against the dollar, 
currently trading at USD1.7150, consolidating from a near six-year high in early trade of USD1.7180.
Although there ars no top-tier UK data scheduled Friday, the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders gave a 
positive signal, saying that new car registrations rose by more than 10% in the first half of the year, with the 6.2% 
year-on-year rise in June marking the 28th consecutive month of increases.
"Improving economic conditions have helped propel the UK new car market to a strong first half-year performance," 
said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.
There's nothing left in the data calendar Friday, with US markets closed.
"The big challenge for European markets on this volume-light day, is to avoid any sudden lurches downward that 
might spoil what has been a very good week for equity markets," said IG market analyst David Madden.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The FTSE 100 closed flat Friday, just below its all-time record high, but a string of 
strong performances in the first few days of July ensured that the blue-chip index posted its biggest weekly gain 
since the week ending May 2.
Trading volumes were extremely low, partly because Wall Street was closed for the July 4 holiday and there was 
little in the way of economic data to provide direction. 
After a modestly lower close on Monday, the FTSE 100 then rose for the next four days, buoyed by some upbeat 
data from the UK, some strong purchasing managers' index readings from China, and, most recently, a much 
stronger-than-expected jobs report and non-farm payrolls from the US.
The gains mean that the index has already more than reversed the losses posted in the month of June.
The FTSE 100 closed up 0.01% at 6,866.05 Friday, but up 1.6% for the week, meaning it is less than 100 points 
shy of its all-time high of 6,950.60. The FTSE 250 closed up 0.1% at 16,050.16, and up 2.4% for the week, while 
the AIM All-Share index closed up 0.1% at 790.62, but up 1.1% for the week.
Major European bourses ended the day fractionally lower, but posted strong gains for the week. The DAX 30 in 
Germany closed down 0.2% Friday, but up 2% for the week, while the CAC 40 in Paris closed down 0.5%, but up 
0.7% for the week.
"It’s been a fairly quiet session in Europe today with the US off for their annual Independence Day holiday, no doubt 
enjoying the afterglow of yesterday’s positive jobs numbers, amidst a haze of cold beer and hotdogs," said Michael 
Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
MARKET COMMENT: FTSE 100 Posts Biggest Weekly Gain For 9 Weeks
EasyJet and International Consolidated Airlines Group were among the biggest risers in the FTSE 100, after low-
cost airlines easyJet and Ryanair Holdings, as well as Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group, all announced that 
passenger numbers continued to rise in June. 
EasyJet said it flew 6.1 million passengers in June, up 10% on the 5.5 million passengers flown in June last year. 
Load factor also rose during the month, rising to 92% from 90% in the comparable month. On a rolling 12 month 
basis, the airline said passenger numbers to June 2014 were up 5.4% to 63.4 million, from 60.2 million recorded in 
June last year. Load factor for the 12-month period was also up, coming in at 90% from 89% in June 2013
Both easyJet and IAG ended the day among the biggest risers in the blue-chip index, closing up 1% and 0.7%, 
respectively.
At the other end of the spectrum, Sports Direct International closed down 2.1%, making it the heaviest faller in the 
FTSE 100, as it gave back some of the strong gains posted on Thursday. The company closed up 5.6% Thursday 
after investment bank Jefferies said that it expects the company's full-year results on July 17 to detail strong top-line 
growth, and healthy underlying pretax earnings. 
In the FTSE 250, Serco Group, closing down 0.8%, and Stagecoach Group, closing down 0.4%, both fell after 
French transport group Keolis Amey Docklands was awarded the franchise to run the Docklands Light Railway in 
London from December 7, seeing off rival bids from the UK-based companies. The award means Serco has lost the 
franchise.
Keolis, a joint venture majority owned by French state rail operator SNCF, will operate and maintain the network 
until April 2021, with an option for this to be extended until 2023. Transport for London said around 100 million 
passenger journeys are made on the DLR network annually and this new contract, which is valued in excess of 
GBP700 million, will see Keolis Amey Docklands work with TfL to ensure that passengers continue to see 
improvements to the service.
Bus and rail operator Go-Ahead Group, which withdrew from the competition before it reached its conclusion, 
closed down 1.5% after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to Buy, from Conviction Buy.
Meanwhile, William Hill, closing up 1.4%, was among the leading risers in the mid-cap index Friday. The bookmaker 
has appointed insider James Henderson as its new chief executive, replacing Ralph Topping, who is stepping down 
at the end of July after more than four decades at the company. 
Incoming CEO Henderson, who has been with the company for 29 years after starting out at the company as a 
trainee manager, is currently William Hill's group director of operations, overseeing the UK retail business, online, 
and William Hill in Australia and the US. 
In the forex market, the euro edged lower Friday after data showed that German factory orders fell more-than-
forecast in May as both domestic and foreign orders decreased from last month. The data showed Europe's largest 
economy's factory orders falling by 1.7% in the month of May, while on a yearly basis growth slowed to 5.5% from 
6.3% in April.
At the close of the UK equity market, the single currency trades at USD1.3598, CHF1.2157, and JPY138.790. The 
pound trades at USD1.7157, EUR1.2615, CHF1.5339, and JPY175.121.
In the data calendar on Monday, German industrial production numbers are released at 0700 BST, ahead of French 
trade data at 0745 BST. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research's UK GDP estimate is released at 
1500 BST.
In the corporate calendar, FTSE 250-listed Taylor Wimpey is scheduled to release a trading update.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
late Friday morning.
-------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
-------
EasyJet, up 2.5%, and International Consolidated Airlines, up 1.4%. The airline companies are the two biggest 
winners in the blue-chip index after easyJet, Ryanair Holdings and Aer Lingus Group all announced that passenger 
numbers continued to rise in June. EasyJet said it flew 6.1 million passengers in June, up 10.1% on the 5.5 million 
passengers flown in June last year. Load factor also rose during the month, rising to 92.0% from 89.9% in the 
comparable month. On a rolling 12 month basis, the airline said passenger numbers to June 2014 were up 5.4% to 
63.4 million, from 60.2 million recorded in June last year. Load factor for the 12-month period was also up, coming 
in at 90.1% from 89.2% in June 2013. 
BT Group, up 1%. The company has said that the trustee of the BT Pension Scheme entered into longevity 
insurance and reinsurance arrangements to protect the scheme against costs associated with potential increases in 
life expectancy. The arrangements will provide long-term protection and income to the scheme should members live 
longer than currently expected. The trustee has set up a wholly owned insurance company, and the scheme has 
transferred longevity risk to this insurer, who has in turn re-insured the risk with The Prudential Insurance Co of 
America, a subsidiary of Prudential Finance Inc.
-------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS

Sports Direct International, down 1%. The UK retailer's shares have given back some of the strong gains posted on 
Thursday, and is currently the biggest faller in the blue-chip index. Sports Direct closed up 5.6% on Thursday after 
UK WINNERS & LOSERS: Serco Derailed By Loss Of Docklands Franchise
investment bank Jefferies said that it expects the company's full-year results on July 17 to detail strong top-line 
growth, and healthy underlying pretax earnings. 
GlaxoSmithKline, down 0.5%. The pharmaceutical company is among the heaviest fallers in the blue-chip index, 
even though it said, alongside Theravance Inc, that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has 
approved its Anoro Ellipta treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Under the terms of their 2002 
agreement Theravance will pay a USD10 million milestone payment to Glaxo following the approval.
-------
FTSE 250 - WINNERS
-------
AVEVA Group, up 3.1%. Société Générale has initiated AVEVA with a Buy recommendation and 2,650 pence price 
target. SocGen believes that the demand outlook in the company's marine and nuclear sectors is improving and 
expects this to help AVEVA generate double-digit organic growth over the next three years. It also sees long-term 
growth opportunities in the company's enterprise solutions division - primarily from its data management software 
AVEVA NET - and assigns a value of 300 pence to 400p to this segment, which it believes is not currently priced in. 
Additionally, SocGen sees AVEVA as a potentially attractive acquisition candidate.
William Hill, up 1.8%. The bookmaker has appointed James Henderson as its new chief executive officer to drive 
the business both internationally and online, replacing Ralph Topping, who is stepping down at the end of July after 
more than four decades at the company. Henderson, who has been with the company for 29 years after starting out 
at the company as a trainee manager, is currently William Hill's group director of operations, overseeing the UK 
retail business, online, and William Hill in Australia and the US. William Hill said it plans to drive the business 
forward online and abroad, having established a good presence in Australia, the US and continental Europe.
St Modwen Properties, up 1.7%. Liberum Capital has increased its target price on St Modwen to 443 pence from 
432p, saying that the 6% net asset value growth recorded in the company's first half is a prelude to accelerating 
growth. The 6% net asset value growth reported by the company in the six months to end-May is broadly in line with 
the rate of growth in the 2013 full year, says Liberum analyst Jon Stewart. This, however, is expected to accelerate 
over the next 12 months, with forecasts showing 60% NAV growth between November 2013 and 2016 estimates, 
underpinned by a diverse range of factors, the analyst adds.
Hiscox, up 1.2%. Berenberg has raised its rating on Hiscox to Hold From Sell as it believes the insurance group will 
pay a special dividend at the end of the year. "We continue to view the shares as fully valued, but believe the 
company maintains an excess capital position beyond its needs which will see a further special dividend distribution 
of 35.0p per share," Berenberg said.
-------
FTSE 250 - LOSERS
-------
Serco Group, down 0.8%. The support services company has been unsuccessful in its rebid for the franchise to 
manage, operate and maintain the Docklands Light Railway in London. It said it has been informed by Transport for 
London that it was unsuccessful in its rebid after operating the DLR since 1997 under two franchises. The current 
franchise, which was due to end on September 14, has been extended to December 7, at which point the service 
will transfer to the new franchisee, French transport group Kelois Amey Docklands. Serco said that the DLR 
contract generated revenue of approximately GBP90 million, or 2% of the group's overall revenues in 2013, at a 
margin that was significantly below the average level the group achieves on its contracts. 
-------
AIM ALL-SHARE - WINNERS
-------
North River Resources, up 21%. The mineral exploration and development company said it has signed a USD12 
million project equity agreement with Greenstone Resources, providing it with the equity capital to re-open the 
Namib mine in Namibia, and bring the site back into production. It said the funding packaging will allow it to restart 
UK WINNERS & LOSERS: Serco Derailed By Loss Of Docklands Franchise
the company's Namib lead and zinc project, and that site preparation and advanced construction planning will begin 
immediately.
Formation Group, up 19%. The company said that the total balance of GBP18.4 million owed related to the Aldgate 
East Property Development has been received by JV Finance Ventures Ltd, in which Formation holds a 36.88% 
interest.Of the payment received by JV Finance, Formation expects an entitlement of GBP6.8 million. To date it has 
received GBP1.6 million. It has used GBP590,000 of this to fund the purchase of a property at 161 Iverson Road in 
April. The remaining funds will be used to fund future purchases of development properties, or may be used as 
working capital.
Chariot Oil & Gas, up 5.7%. The oil and gas exploration company's shares have jumped after it said it had signed a 
farm-out agreement with Australian exploration and production company, Woodside Petroleum Ltd, for the Rabat 
Deep prospect offshore Morocco. It said under the terms of the farm-out agreement, Woodside will acquire a 25% 
working interest in the Rabat Deep Offshore permits I-VI in Morocco, in return for paying 100% of Chariot's 3D 
seismic data costs incurred in Rabat Deep, back costs on the block and a carry on additional data acquisition. 
There is also an option for Woodside to fund the costs of an exploration well to an agreed cap for a further 25% 
equity interest and operatorship.
Noricum Gold, up 4.9%. The gold exploration and development company said it has continued to be pleased with 
the results of its soil-sampling programme at the Schonberg precious metals projects in south-central Australia. The 
company is nearing the end of the soil-sampling programme, having taken 1,811 samples from four target areas 
across the licence area. Multiple gold and copper in soil anomalies have been delineated, and will continue to be 
refined through coming work, the company said.

BRUSSELS (Alliance News) - European stocks rallied on Thursday, pushing into positive territory for the week, as 
dovish comments from the US Federal Reserve eased speculation about an imminent rate hike.
The Fed tapered its asset buying program by USD10 billion per month yesterday, but Fed Chair Janet Yellen said it 
would be "considerable time" between when the bond taper ends and when rate hikes begin.
Mining stocks were bolstered as the US dollar weakened on the news.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks rose 1.07%.

PARIS (Alliance News) - The European markets are trading higher on Thursday, after the Fed's policymaking 
committee on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged and announced another USD10 billion cut in its monthly 
bond-buying program.
While terming recent inflation figures as "noisy" Fed chair Janet Yellen made it clear that the central bank intends to 
keep rates low "for a considerable time" after the bond-buying ends.
In economic news, British retail sales declined in May largely due to a fall in food store sales, the Office for National 
Statistics said. Retail sales volume, including auto fuel, fell 0.5% in May from April. This was the second fall in last 
five months and matched economists' expectations.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is adding 1.13%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, is gaining 0.80%.
The German DAX, the French CAC 40 and the UK's FTSE 100 are rising between 0.8% and 0.9%. Switzerland's 
SMI is climbing 0.3%.
In Frankfurt, ThyssenKrupp and E.ON are rising 2.2% each. Basf is gaining 1.6%.
Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen are gaining between 1.3% and 1%.
Real estate services provider Deutsche Annington is losing moderately, even as Societe Generale raised the stock 
to ''Premium List.''
In Paris, Saint-Gobain is rising 3% and Schneider Electric is adding 2.5%.
Societe Generale and Credit Agricole are gaining 2% and 1.6%, respectively. BNP Paribas is up 0.7%.
European Markets Rise On Fed Stance
Bucking the trend, EDF is declining 6.7%, after French Energy Minister Segolene Royal said a price increase would 
not be applied.
Air France-KLM is dropping 2.4%. UBS cut the stock to ''Sell'' from ''Neutral.''
In London, Rolls-Royce is gaining 5.6% after announcing a 1 billion pounds share buyback.
Barratt Developments is gaining 3.2% and CRH is rising 2.8%.
UBS raised Ryanair to ''Buy'' from ''Neutral.'' The stock is moderately higher.
The Asian stocks, which opened on a strong note after the US Federal Reserve struck a more dovish stance, ended 
mixed.
In the US, futures point to a higher open on Wall Street, ahead of reports on weekly jobless claims and 
Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity.
In the previous session, stocks gained ground for the fourth consecutive day. The Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 
added 0.6% each, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.8%.
Crude for August delivery is rising USD0.48 to USD106.07 per barrel, while gold is gaining USD10.0 to USD1282.7

LONDON (Alliance News) - Major stock markets are lower across the UK and Europe Wednesday, led by falls in 
airline stocks after Germany's Lufthansa issued a profit warning that has hurt the whole sector, and as trading 
volumes remain well-below average.
Meanwhile, the pound jumped to a session high against other major currencies following the release of the best 
reading of UK unemployment since January 2009.
By mid-morning Wednesday, the FTSE 100 is down 0.5% at 6,842.44, the FTSE 250 is down 0.9% at 16,061.60, 
and the AIM All-Share is down 0.7% at 798.31.
Within major European markets, the German DAX is down 0.8%, and the French CAC 40 is down 0.7%.
Airlines are amongst the worst performing stocks, with International Consolidated Airlines, owner of British Airways, 
leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 5.2%, and Easyjet not far behind, down 3.5%, and Ryanair down 2.2%.
The falls come after German flag-carrier Lufthansa said it will no longer achieve its 2014 and 2015 operating 
targets. The primary reason for the lowered expectations was the problem of a shortage of passengers and cargo, 
coupled with an over-abundance of seats and space on its planes in its European and US business. Lufthansa 
shares are down almost 15% in Frankfurt.
Adding to airline woes Wednesday, Emirates Airline has decided to cancel its order of 70 A350 XWB aircraft from 
Airbus Group. Airbus said that the decision came in light of Emirates' ongoing fleet requirement review.
Both of the shocks to the airline industry have impacted on partners and suppliers alike Wednesday, with Rolls-
Royce, which makes engines for Airbus, down 2.3%, and GKN, which supplies parts, down 1.3%.
Even FTSE Small-Cap listed airline Flybe is underperforming Wednesday, down 2.2% despite reporting that it 
swung into profit for its 2014 financial year. The company reported a pretax profit of GBP8.1 million, compared with 
a pretax loss of GBP41.1 million a year ago.
MARKET COMMENT: Shares Hit By Lufthansa Warning As Pound Rallies
Global appetite for equities has not been helped Wednesday by a late Tuesday announcement from the World 
Bank that cut its global growth forecast for 2014 to 2.8% from the 3.2% it had earlier estimated. The bank noted the 
shaky start to the year, both in terms of the bad weather in the US, and the political tension in Ukraine.
While equities struggle, the pound is rallying Wednesday on the back of some stronger-than-expected UK 
unemployment data. Unemployment in the UK dropped by 27,400 in April, after falling at 28,400 in March, and 
beating economists expectations of a 25,000 fall. The headline three-month rolling average unemployment rate 
dropped to 6.6% from 6.8%, beating the expectations for a drop to 6.7%.
The unemployment rate is now well below the original threshold set by the Bank of England of 7.0%, before which it 
would consider an interest rate rise. While the BoE's targets have since been expanded way beyond than this 
single economic measure, the lower unemployment falls, the louder calls for rate rises will grow, and that is 
reflected in the movement of the pound Wednesday, which has jumped against the dollar to a session high of 
almost USD1.68, and has recorded an 18-month high against the euro of EUR1.2413.
However, with the UK central bank now looking at a broad range of indicators before raising interest rates, average 
earnings data, released at the same time, were less positive. Average earnings growth had almost returned to 
above inflation in recent months, creating excitement about the return of real wage growth. However, earnings 
growth slipped back to 0.9% in the three months to April, well below current UK CPI of 1.8%.
"Unemployment may be falling but this is largely being driven by a boom in the self-employed and isn’t being 
matched by a corresponding boost in pay packets," said UFXMarkets Managing Director Dennis de Jong. "We 
might not be in the same bleak position as the slumbering Eurozone but with average weekly earnings (growth) half 
the CPI inflation rate there is still a long way to go before workers notice any day-to-day improvement to their 
standard of living."
Outside of the airline stocks, a number of big names UK equity names going ex-dividend Wednesday are also 
weighing on indices. Vodafone is down 3.1% after going ex a 0.0747p full year dividend, while Johnson Matthey is 
down 1.9% after going ex a 0.455 pence full-year payment. Morrisons has also gone ex-dividend, but the stock is 
being supported a well received first-quarter update from supermarket peer Sainsbury's.
Sainsbury's leads the FTSE 100 gainers, up 1.9% after publishing its first-quarter numbers. The supermarket 
posted its second consecutive quarterly price drop, as the price war between the big names in the UK continues, 
but it also said that it expects like-for-like sales growth to remain positive for the full-year.
"Compared to the generally overcast outlook for the sector, it has not been such a bad performance, and it seems 
that Sainsbury’s lead over its competitors is holding up for now," says IG market analyst Brenda Kelly.
The numbers were Chief Executive Justin King's swan song before he steps down next month. In his last journalist 
call, the CEO said: "We are playing our part in this pricing skirmish. We are toe to toe with our competitors, and we 
have never been more competitive than we are today."
The UK unemployment data was the major economic focus Wednesday, with no top-tier data due from the US. 
Futures trading currently indicates that stocks in the US are set to follow Europe lower, with the DJIA pointing down 
0.2% and the S&P 500 pointing down 0.3%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock markets across the UK and Europe closed lower Wednesday after a warning 
about the strength of the global economic recovery, with airline stocks leading the falls after a profit warning from 
Germany's Lufthansa and a major aircraft order cancellation by Emirates sent shock-waves through the sector.
Equities got off to a poor start after the World Bank late Tuesday downgraded it's global growth forecasts for 2014 
to 2.8%, from the 3.2% growth it previously estimated. The bank said global economic growth in 2014 is likely to be 
weaker than expected, due to poor weather in the US, financial market turbulence, and the Ukraine crisis.
"Markets in Europe didn’t take too well the World Bank’s latest growth forecasts, trading in the red for most of the 
day," said CMC Markets market analyst Jasper Lawler.
The FTSE 100 had traded in a tight range amid low volumes Monday and Tuesday, but closed Wednesday 0.5% 
lower at 6,838.87. The FTSE 250 closed down 0.8% at 16,087.63, and the AIM All-Share closed down 0.5% at 
799.42.
In Europe, the German DAX closed down 0.8% and the French CAC 40 closed down 0.9%, while on Wall Street, 
the DJIA was down 0.6% and the S&P 500 down 0.4% when the European markets closed.
Airlines were amongst the worst performing stocks across Europe, with International Consolidated Airlines Group, 
owner of British Airways and Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling, closing down 3.1%, Easyjet down 4.0%, and 
Ireland's Ryanair down 1.9%.
MARKET COMMENT: Growth Downgrade Sends Stocks Lower, Airlines Lead Fall
German flag carrier Deutsche Lufthansa said it will no longer achieve its 2014 and 2015 operating targets, warning 
that it was having to reduce prices on European and US routes due to weak demand, and it had also been hit by a 
recent pilots strike. Lufthansa shares closed down almost 15% in Frankfurt.
Adding to airline woes Wednesday, Dubai-based Emirates decided to cancel an order of 70 A350 XWB aircraft from 
Airbus Group after reviewing its fleet requirements.
Rolls-Royce Holdings, which was due to provide the engines the cancelled Emirates planes, ended as one of the 
heaviest FTSE 100 fallers, down 2.8%, while GKN, which makes parts for Airbus planes, was down 1.1%. Rolls-
Royce said the cancellation has knocked about 3.5%, or GBP2.6 billion, off its order book.
While stocks across Europe were falling, the pound put in a strong performance after UK unemployment fell to its 
lowest level since 2009.
Unemployment in the UK dropped by 27,400 in April, after falling by 28,400 in March, beating economists' 
expectations of a 25,000 fall. The headline three-month rolling average unemployment rate dropped to 6.6%, from 
6.8%, beating expectations for a drop to 6.7%.
With the UK economy continuing to outperform while the European Central Bank is forced to introduce negative 
interest rates to boost its struggling economy, the pound peaked at an 18-month high against the euro Wednesday 
at EUR1.2413. Sterling also gained against the dollar Wednesday, reaching a session high of USD1.6797.
However, with the UK central bank now looking at a broad range of indicators as a trigger for potential interest rate 
increases, average earnings data, released at the same time as the unemployment numbers, were less positive, 
keeping a lid on sterling's gains. Average earnings growth has almost reached the the same level as inflation in 
recent months, creating excitement about the return of real wage growth. However, earnings growth slipped back to 
0.9% in the three months to April, well below current UK CPI of 1.8%.
"Unemployment may be falling but this is largely being driven by a boom in the self-employed and isn’t being 
matched by a corresponding boost in pay packets," said UFXMarkets Managing Director Dennis de Jong. "We 
might not be in the same bleak position as the slumbering Eurozone but with average weekly earnings (growth) half 
the CPI inflation rate there is still a long way to go before workers notice any day-to-day improvement to their 
standard of living."
Shore Capital investment Strategist Gerard Lane said that the data reaffirms that the UK economic recovery is "job 
rich, pay poor" and "we suggest that this will aid the maintenance of a low inflation backdrop".
J Sainsbury outperformed the falling market Wednesday, leading the FTSE 100 gainers in early trade and closing 
up 1.2%, despite reporting a drop in like-for-like sales. The UK's third largest supermarket chain reported a 1.1% 
decline in like-for-like sales including VAT but excluding fuel for the 12 weeks to June 7, its second consecutive 
quarterly decline after nine years of unbroken sales growth.
"Even though the loss is bad news, some analysts were expecting worse, and Sainsbury’s forecast they’d 
outperform supermarket peers this year," said CMC Markets market analyst Jasper Lawler. "There does seem to be 
a general perception that they’re doing better than Tesco and Morrisons to fight off the discounters."
A number of big UK equity names going ex-dividend Wednesday also weighed on indices. Vodafone closed down 
4.6% after going ex a 0.0747p full year dividend, while Johnson Matthey closed down 1.3% after going ex a 0.455 
pence full-year payment.
MARKET COMMENT: Growth Downgrade Sends Stocks Lower, Airlines Lead Fall
Quindell, the AIM-listed provider of software and consultancy services, dropped 20% Wednesday after saying it 
won't be able to move to the London Stock Exchange's main market for the time being because it hasn't been able 
to satisfy some of the rules of a premium listing on that market.
Quindell saw its shares fall sharply back in April after Gotham City Research LLC said it was unable to reconcile 
between 42% and 80% of Quindell's profits. The stock, which is currently the seventh biggest by market 
capitalisation on AIM, now trades roughly 70% lower than it did less than three months ago, even though Quindell 
has rejected Gotham City's allegations, started legal action against it, and raised doubts about its motives after 
saying Gotham took a short position on Quindell before publishing its research.
Smaller oil and gas companies operating in Iraq were hit hard after Islamist insurgents in Iraq seized the city of 
Tikrit, their second major gain after capturing Mosul on Tuesday, the BBC quoted security officials as saying. The 
insurgents are from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the BBC said. Genel Energy closed down 5.8%, Gulf 
Keystone Petroleum more than 10%, and Afren down 4.4%. All three operate in Kurdish-run provinces north of the 
affected cities.
Looking ahead to Thursday's UK corporate calendar, full year results are due from Volex, WS Atkins, Halma, 
Mulberry Group, PZ Cussons, Hardy Oil & Gas, boohoo.com, and Pets At Home Group.
There's no UK data scheduled in the economic calendar Thursday. The morning focus will be on data from Europe, 
with French consumer price inflation data due ahead of the equity market open, and eurozone industrial production 
data due at 1000 BST.
US weekly initial jobless claims and retail sales data will provide the main afternoon economic focus.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum Capital has lowered easyJet's price target to 1,650.00 pence from 1,700.00p, 
saying that, after a "remarkable" financial performance over the last three years, it expects a more modest rate of 
improvement from here on.
Over the past three years, the company's earnings per share have risen a cumulative 178%, operating margins 
have improved to 12% from 7%, and post-tax return on invested capital has increased to 17% from 8%, says 
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo.
However, while the airline company retains its strong position in the European short-haul market, and remains 
poised to pursue further profitable and value-accretive growth, "three years of significant improvements in financial 
performance have created tough comparatives and attracted greater competition," the analyst says.
"Strong financial returns inevitably attract competition," Khoo says. Ryanair Holdings and easyJet largely avoid 
head-to-head competition with one another, while flag carriers tend to scale back in the face of low-cost attacks, but 
second-tier low-cost carriers, such as Norwegian and International Consolidated Airlines Group's Vueling "appear to 
have more stomach for a fight," he says.
Accordingly, Khoo expects that airports Gatwick and Rome Fiumicino will be key battlegrounds for easyJet this 
summer.
Trading at a price to earnings ratio of 13.6x, easyJet's valuation is starting to appear more reasonable after recent 
share price weakness, says Khoo. The analyst believes that easyJet's fundamentals remain strong and attractive, 
with margins amongst the higher in the industry, and returns on capital well above its cost of capital. 
However, "although this may be a reasonable entry point for long-term investors, we are concerned about short-
term downside risks to estimates," says Khoo.
Accordingly, Liberum has retained its Hold recommendation on the stock.
IN THE KNOW: Liberum Cuts EasyJet Target To 1,650p, Keeps At Hold
EasyJet's shares are quoted down 1.2% at 1,588.00 pence, placing them amongst the biggest fallers in the FTSE 
100.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Tuesday said it has issued its first ever Euro Bond, worth 
EUR850 million at 1.875%, fixed for seven years, forming part of its strategy to access the debt capital markets to 
source low cost financing for new aircraft due to be delivered later this year.

Ryanair said the bond was more than eight times over-subscribed and investors were attracted to its strong rating 
from Standard & Poor's and Fitch.
The bond will be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, which offers access to investors both in Europe and the rest of 
the world. 
The coordinator for the bond was Citibank, while the joint book runners were BNP Paribas, Citibank, and Deutsche 
Bank.  
Ryanair Holdings shares closed up 0.5% at EUR7.61 Tuesday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, said Wednesday that traffic in 
May grew 4% as it continues to make improvements to its customer experience.
Ryanair said it flew 8.2 million passengers in May, up 4% from the 7.9 million flown in May last year. 
Load factor - a measure of how many seats on its planes are filled - rose by 3% to 85% during the month.
For the 12 months to end-May, Ryanair flew 82.3 million passengers, 3% more than in the previous 12 months, 
while its load factor was 83%.
Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs said May's traffic grew "thanks to the continuing success of our 
lower fares and our improving customer experience, including our great new website, allocated seating, a free 
[second] small carry-on bag and PED use on all flights."
The company said it is especially pleased with its 3% rise in May's load factor - coming in slightly ahead of its 2% 
point growth target. 
Last month the company reported a decline in fiscal 2014 profit, mainly reflecting a 4% drop in fares, weaker 
Sterling, and higher fuel costs. Revenues increased with higher ancillary revenues and traffic. Looking ahead, the 
company projected increased profit and traffic for fiscal 2015.
Shares in Ryanair were trading 2.39% higher at 7.454 pence per share Wednesday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UK shares have opened mostly lower, with small-caps slightly outperforming 
Wednesday ahead of the Queen's Speech and further European economic data.
Starting the trading day on a negative note, Tesco PLC reported a sharp drop in sales in the first quarter of its new 
financial year, as Britain's biggest supermarket chain said it was hit hard by deep price cuts across the business 
and by the acceleration of its store refit programme.
Tesco again reported disappointing sales figures, posting a 3.3% like-for-like decline in sales including petrol for the 
quarter ended May 24, and a 3.2% fall excluding petrol. It was hardest hit in the UK, where like-for-like sales in the 
business were down 3.8% including petrol, and 3.7% excluding petrol.
On a more positive note, Ryanair reported a rise in May traffic and load factor.

well-designed democratic and legitimate system can effectively solve social conflicts," Ma said. He said that since 
Taiwan lifted martial law in 1987, dissenting opinions have been tolerated, and the territory has learned that only 
robust democracy and legitimate government can address the people's concerns.

South Koreans headed to the polls Wednesday in the first nationwide vote since public anger erupted over the 
Sewol ferry disaster in April. Leaders of the ruling conservative Saenuri Party have called for voters to give it 
another chance in the local and municipal elections, after confidence in President Park Geun Hye's administration 
plummeted due to the fatal ferry accident. Saenuri campaigned on a promise to fix social problems that it said were 
revealed through the ferry tragedy, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported. The largest opposition party, 
New Politics Alliance for Democracy, called for voters to make a judgement on the government, saying it had failed 
to protect South Korean lives.

Former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sissi was officially declared Egypt's new president on Tuesday after the electoral 
commission confirmed that he secured almost 97% of the vote in last week's elections. Turnout reached 47.45% of 
Egypt's 54 million registered voters, the commission said. There were some doubts over the accuracy of the figure 
due to the slow voting process observed during the three-day election.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was expected to easily win a third seven-year term in Tuesday's election, even 
as opposition groups and the international community decried the electoral process.
Polling was limited to government-controlled areas. Large parts of the country remained off limits to state officials 
after more than three years of civil war that have left more than 162,000 people dead. The election was denounced 
by the Syrian opposition and its Western supporters. The poll was the first to see al-Assad face rival candidates. 
But the two low-profile figures running against him were not expected to make any impact.

Israel suffered an embarrassing blow Tuesday when both the US and the EU rejected its call to boycott the new 
Palestinian unity government. Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, convening his first cabinet session in 
UK MORNING BRIEFING: Tesco Reports Sales Decline Amid Price Cutting
Ramallah, welcomed the decision by Arab countries, the US and EU to cooperate with his government "politically 
and financially." Hamdallah met with John Rutter, EU representative to Palestine, and promised to abide by all 
international agreements, moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' political programme and pursue 
peaceful means to achieve Palestinian statehood.

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC reported Monday a decline in fiscal 2014 
profit, mainly reflecting a 4% drop in fares, weaker Sterling, and higher fuel costs.
Revenues increased with higher ancillary revenues and traffic. Looking ahead, the company projects increased 
profit and traffic for fiscal 2015. In London, the stock is gaining around 5% in the morning trading.
For the year 2014, the company's net profit, on IFRS basis, declined 8% to 523 million euros from last year's 569 
million euros. Earnings per share dropped 6% to 36.96 euro cents from 39.45 euro cents a year ago.
Revenue for the year amounted to 5.04 billion euros, a 3% increase from 4.88 billion euros reported a year back. 
Ancillary revenues advanced 17%, much faster than traffic growth, and now accounts for 25% of total revenues, the 
company said.
Traffic grew 3% to 81.7 million passengers from 79.3 million passengers in the previous year. Load factor increased 
1% to 83%.
Revenue per passenger was flat, as strong ancillary revenue growth offset a fall in average fares. Excluding fuel, 
sector length adjusted unit costs declined 3%.
In a weaker environment, the company noted that it lowered its fares and improved customer experience, resulting 
in second-half traffic growing 4% as load factors improved by 1%.
The company further noted that its forward bookings for Summer 14 are significantly ahead of last year since it 
began offering lower fares and released seasonal schedules earlier, and would continue to deliver 2% higher load 
factors.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, Ryanair expects a strong first half, but a weaker second half, would generate a 
significant increase in after tax profits to a range between 580 million euros and 620 million euros.
Ryanair Profit Down, Sees Growth In Fiscal 2015 Profit, Traffic
The company expects traffic to increase 4% to over 84.6 million as load factors increase 2% to 85% and with the 
addition of some limited new route and capacity growth.
According to the firm, most of the projected traffic growth would be skewed towards the second half as it reduce 
winter grounding to approximately 50 aircraft in fiscal 2015 from 70 aircraft last year.
The company also expects fares to rise by up to 2% in the new year, following a decline last year. The first-half 
fares would rise by up to 6% due in part to Easter, stable growth in the second quarter, and stronger forward 
bookings and load factors.
Meanwhile, the company remains very cautious about the second half due to last winter's weak price environment, 
and expects its commitment to 6% capacity growth could cause fares in this period to fall by as much as 6% to 8%.
Ryanair also projects flat unit costs, while fuel costs will be lower than last year as 90% are hedged.
Further, Ryanair said it would return a further 500 million euros to shareholders in the fourth quarter through a 
special dividend subject to AGM approval.
In London, Ryanair stock is gaining 0.30 euros or 4.69%, and trading at 6.65 euros.

(An item published at 0654 BST misstated the revenue figures. The correct version follows.)
DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC posted 8% lower full-year net profit of 523 
million euros, versus last year's 569 million euros, chiefly due to a 4% decline in fares, weaker sterling, and higher 
fuel costs. 
The firm said it reacted quickly to this weaker environment last September by lowering fares and improving its 
customer experience, that caused traffic in the second half to grow 4% as load factors improved by 1%. On a per 
share basis, basic earnings came in at 36.96 euro cents, down 6%, compared with the prior year's 39.45 euro 
cents.
IFRS revenue for the year amounted to 5.04 billion euros, a 3% increase from 4.9 billion euros reported a year 
back. Ancillary revenues advanced by 17%, much faster than traffic growth, and now accounts for 25% of total 
revenues.
For the year, traffic grew by 3% year-on-year to 81.7 million passengers, from 79.3 million passengers.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, the company expects traffic to increase 4% to over 84.6 million as load factors 
increase by 2% to 85% and it adds some limited new route and capacity growth.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Airlines stocks are flying higher Monday despite Ryanair reporting a drop in profit for 
the year ended March 31, as the low-cost Irish carrier also predicted that its passenger numbers and revenue will 
rise in the current financial year, providing a boost to the whole sector.
For the recent financial year, Ryanair's net profit declined 8% to EUR523 million from EUR569 million the year 
before. 
However, the numbers were in line with consensus forecasts and management appears relatively optimistic about 
the first half of financial year 2015, says Liberum Capital analyst Gerald Khoo.
Given the favourable timing of Easter, limited capacity growth, and strong forward bookings, average first half fares 
are seen 6% higher. However, while management sound optimistic over the coming six month, yields are likely to 
slide again in the second half, says Khoo.
Ryanair is attempting to reposition itself, with measures such as reserved seating, a re-designed web-site, and new 
advertising. The repositioning appears to have brought additional costs, with non-fuel costs for the 2015 financial 
year expected to be 5% higher due to pay rises, higher marketing spend and new aircraft deliveries.
Moreover, Ryanair and its competitors, including FTSE 100 listed easyJet, are increasing their capacity across the 
route network in the coming year. Ryanair is targeting 6% capacity growth and analysts are anticipating an overall 
capacity increase in the industry of 4.1% year-on-year. "This is enough to warrant some caution on yields," said 
Investec analyst James Hollins. Indeed, Ryanair's management guides to a fall in yields in the second half of 
between 6% to 8%.
However, although there may be some temptation to assume that management's guidance may follow the usual 
pattern of starting low and rising through the year, on a 2015 price-to-earnings ratio of 13.6x, Ryanair trades at a 
modest premium to easyJet, which does not make the stock look compelling, says Liberum analyst Khoo. "Although 
IN THE KNOW: Ryanair Lifts Airlines But Capacity Growth A Concern
the Irish air-line remains well positioned, there is upward pressure on costs and downward pressure on margins and 
consensus estimates," the analyst says.
Limerum reiterates a Hold recommendation on Ryanair, with a price target of EUR6.40. Ryanair shares are up 5.6% 
at EUR6.703. The sector read across sees easyJet lead the FTSE 100 gainers, up 3.2% at 1,565.90p, while 
International Consolidated Airlines is also a leading gainer, up 2.4% at 366.90p.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
midday Monday.
-------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
-------
EasyJet, up 1.5%, and International Consolidated Airlines Group, up 0.7%. The airline companies are both big 
risers after Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings predicted that its passenger numbers and revenue will rise in the 
current financial year, providing a boost to the whole sector. Despite reporting a decline in fiscal 2014 profit, Ryanair 
said it expects traffic to increase 4% to over 84.6 million in fiscal 2015 as load factors increase by two percentage 
points to 85% and with the addition of some limited new route and capacity growth. The company also expects 
fares to rise by up to 2% in the new year, following a decline last year. Ryannair shares are up 7.9%.
Shire, up 0.7%. The pharmaceutical company said late on Friday that it plans to submit a New Drug Application for 
lifitegrast as a treatment for the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in adults. It said that the new submission 
should take place in the first quarter of 2015, after it completes certain chemistry and manufacturing work. 
Additionally, Citigroup has increased Shire's price target to 4,200.00 pence from 4,100.00p Monday.
-------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
-------
AstraZeneca, down 13%. The pharmaceutical giant has rejected a final GBP69 billion takeover proposal from Pfizer 
Inc, potentially ending the US company's interest in its British rival for the time being after Pfizer pledged not to go 
direct to AstraZeneca's shareholders with a hostile offer. Pfizer raised its approach to GBP55.00 a share, from 
GBP50.00 previously, and also sweetened the proposed cash and shares deal with a higher cash component. 
However, AstraZeneca said it still felt that undervalued the company. It left the door ajar for an improved bid from 
UK WINNERS & LOSERS: AstraZeneca Falls On Pfizer Rejection
the US drugs giant, saying that it might be prepared to recommend a bid that was more than 10% above the new 
proposal.
Royal Bank of Scotland Group, down 1.3%. The bank said on Sunday that it is winding down its interest-rate trading 
operations due to tougher capital requirements under regulators' efforts to make banks safer. The move affects the 
state-controlled bank's prime broking and over-the-counter clearing businesses for rates.
Intertek, down 1%. The company has extended the losses it posted on Friday following a raft of negative price 
target revisions. Exane BNP Paribas has lowered its price target on the company to 3,600.00 pence from 
3,700.00p, JPMorgan Cazenove has cut its target to 3,033.00p from 3,165.00p, Goldman Sachs has cut its target to 
3,325.00p from 3,475.00p, Barlays has lowered its target to 3,300.00p from 3,370.00p, Berenberg has cut its target 
to 2,900.00p from 3,000.00p, and Societe Generale has cut its target to 3,200.00p from 3,300.00p. Morgan Stanley, 
however, has increased its price target to 3,400.00p from 3,300.00p, while UBS has removed Intertek from its Least 
Preferred list. Monday's decline comes after shares fell 3.2% on Friday after it said that variable market conditions, 
weaker-than-expected activity in its energy infrastructure market, and the appreciation of sterling hit its first quarter 
revenues.
-------
FTSE 250 - WINNERS
-------
Alent, up 3.6%. The group said its outlook for 2014 is unchanged after trading so far was in line with its 
expectations, with a slight increase in demand in its main principle electronics and automotive end-markets. It said 
its net sales value was GBP98.9 million in the first quarter of the year, down from GBP101.8 million in the first 
quarter of 2013. It said net sales value would have been up 6.5% at constant exchange rates. It said higher demand 
was being driven by higher car production, while improving consumer confidence around the world was helping 
electronics demand.
Micro Focus International, up 3%. The software company said it expects to report revenue growth at constant 
currencies at the upper end of its 3% to 6% guidance range for its last financial year, while its adjusted earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will be in line with market expectations. The company, which 
expects to report full results for the fiscal year to April 30 on June 19, said net debt stood at USD261.0 million at the 
end of that year, which it said demonstrated further good cash generation. The company's adjusted figures exclude 
exceptional items and amortisation.
Domino Printing Sciences, up 1.9%. UBS has upgraded Domino Printing Sciences to Buy from Neutral, retaining its 
840.00 pence price target, following recent share price weakness. The group's shares dropped 4.4% last week 
alone, and are currently 14% below their 2014 high. "Although weakness has been seen across the small-cap 
universe, we believe Domino’s lack of large end-market dependence and the importance of regulation and new 
products will drive relative outperformance as earnings growth comes through," says UBS analyst Robbie Capp.
MITIE Group, up 1.6%. The outsourcing and energy services company said its full-year pretax profit increased by 
21% due to a "steady flow" of contracts within its key facilities-management business, but it also incurred significant 
losses from its ongoing exit from its mechanical and electrical engineering construction business and from the 
design-and-build element of asset management. It said it made a GBP68.4 million pretax profit in the year to end-
March, compared with GBP56.3 million a year earlier. Revenue increased to GBP2.22 billion from GBP2.12 billion, 
while administrative expenses narrowed to GBP243.2 million from GBP249.6 million.
Grafton Group, up 1.6%. The builders' merchant and DIY company said it has signed new five-year revolving credit 
facilities totalling GBP460 million, with its relationship banks. It said the increased facilities provide the group with 
additional financial headroom as it continues to execute its growth strategy. The group said the bilateral multi-
currency facilities have a maturity date of May 2019.

Dixons Retail, up 1.5%. The electronics retailer said it is selling off its ElectroWorld business in central Europe. The 
group, which fell heavily at the end of last week after it agreed to merge with mobile phone retailer Carphone 
Warehouse Group, said it is selling the loss-making business to NAY AS, an electrical specialist retailer which 
operates in the Slovak market, and said it expects to receive a small deferred cash consideration for ElectroWorld, 
which operates 26 retail stores across Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Northern Bear, up 35%. The firm said it plans to resume payment of a final dividend for the year ended March 31, 
after it traded ahead of management expectations during the recent year. The company, which acquires and 
operates mature building-services businesses based in the north of England, said trading in the second half of the 
year, which is often hurt by bad weather, showed particularly strong results. The group added that its current order 
book levels are "very encouraging". It said a strong pipeline of orders, coupled with a bright outlook for both the 
national and local construction sectors, bodes well for its specialist building and support services businesses.
Blue Star Capital, up 16%. The firm's shares have risen sharply after it said Oak Media Ltd has signed an exclusive 
agreement with Playboy TV Europe for the marketing and promotion of Oak Media's Gibraltar-registered Red 8 
casino on Playboy TV's channel inventory. Blue Star Capital, which owns 65% of Oak Media, said the agreement is 
structured as a partnership, with both parties sharing in the casino's profits. It also gives Oak Media marketing 
access to Playboy TV's existing customer database of over 100,000 users who currently interact with the channels.
Mirada, up 13%. The company said it expects to report improved earnings and margins for its recent financial year, 
and said it had secured its biggest contract to date for its multi-screen product with a Latin American digital TV 
operator, which it said will boost significantly earnings in the current financial year. It said that despite slightly lower 
than expected revenues in the second half of the year to end-March, due to investments in Latin America, margins 
were stronger than expected, and it expects to report an improvements in earnings and net results for the year as a 
while. Mirada said that the beginning of its current financial year has been positive, underpinned by a new major 
contract win in Latin America, for its multi-screen product Iris. 
ECR Minerals, up 9.3%. The company said it had got positive assay results from surface and underground channel 
sampling at the Itogon gold project in the Philippines. It said mineralised intercepts by surface channels included 18 
metres at 8.006 parts per million gold, 40 metres at 2.338 parts per million and 22 metres at 1.883 parts per million. 
Sampling within underground workings returned grades of up to 48.4 parts per million of gold, it added. It added that 
it expects assay results from recently completed drilling at Itogon later this month, which will give it even greater 
insight into the potential of the project.
Weatherly International, up 8.2%. The miner's shares have jumped after it said that the projected operating costs at 
its Tschudi copper project in Namibia had been cut and the overall value of the project had been increased. 
Weatherly said Minxcon (Pty) Ltd, its competent person, had provided a financial update for the Tschudi project, 
giving it a net present value of USD133 million. The life of mine cash cost for the project has been calculated at 
USD4,226 per tonne of copper, or USD1.92 per pound, and the breakeven price has been calculated at USD4,675 
per tonne of copper, or USD2.12 per pound. Weatherly said the project was 44% complete at the end of April and 
on schedule to deliver its first copper in the second quarter of 2015.

Legendary Investments, off 9.3%. The investment company has raised GBP900,000 before expenses via a placing 
of 818.2 million new shares at 0.11 pence each with institutional and private investors, funds it said it will use to 
increase its stake in Virtual Stock Holdings. It said it will apply the funds to exercise options over shares in Virtual 
Stock Holdings, which would increase its stake to 5.6%, from 2.2%. Legendary Investments' shares are currently 
quoted at 0.123 pence.

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC posted 8% lower full-year net profit of 523 
million euros, versus last year's 569 million euros, chiefly due to a 4% decline in fares, weaker sterling, and higher 
fuel costs. 
The firm said it reacted quickly to this weaker environment last September by lowering fares and improving its 
customer experience, that caused traffic in the second half to grow 4% as load factors improved by 1%. On a per 
share basis, basic earnings came in at 36.96 euro cents, down 6%, compared with the prior year's 39.45 euro 
cents.
IFRS revenue for the year amounted to 4.9 billion euros, a 3% increase from 5.04 billion euros reported a year 
back. Ancillary revenues advanced by 17%, much faster than traffic growth, and now accounts for 25% of total 
revenues.
For the year, traffic grew by 3% year-on-year to 81.7 million passengers, from 79.3 million passengers.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, the company expects traffic to increase 4% to over 84.6 million as load factors 
increase by 2% to 85% and it adds some limited new route and capacity growth.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Friday said it has received a BBB+ rating from ratings agency 
Fitch, after the airline sought a ratings review as part of its plan to tap the capital markets for low cost financing for 
its new 180 Boeing 737-800 aircraft deliveries.
In a statement, Ryanair noted that Fitch's BBB+ rating matches the BBB+ rating awarded by Standard and Poor's. 
The aircraft deliveries are due to begin in September.
The airline said the ratings reflect the strength of its business model.
"We are pleased with the Fitch rating of BBB+, our second in as many months, following Standard & Poor's BBB+ 
rating, which makes Ryanair the highest rated airline in the world and reflects the financial strength of Ryanair's 
business model," Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Howard Millar said in a statement.
"These BBB+ ratings will enable Ryanair to achieve lower cost financing to ensure that we continue to have the 
lowest costs and offer the lowest fares in Europe for our customers," Millar said.
Ryanair shares were Friday closed at EUR6.35, down 2.6%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Tuesday said it flew 7.8 million 
passengers in April, up from 7.4 million a year earlier, because Easter fell in April this year.
The company said its load factor, a measure of how many seats on its planes are filled, rose to 84%, from 81% in 
April 2013.
Easter is a key period for airlines as many people try and get away for the holidays. Easter fell in April this year, but 
in March last year. Last month, it said it flew 5.2 million passengers in March this year, down 200,000 on the 
previous year, due to the timing of Easter.
However, for the 12 months to end-April, Ryanair flew 82 million passengers, 3% more than in the previous 12 
months, while its load factor was 83%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Wednesday said it will buy five more 737-800 aircraft from 
Boeing Co, meaning it now has 180 aircraft worth over USD16 billion at list prices on order with the US aircraft 
manufacturer.
In a statement, Europe's largest low-cost carrier said four of the latest aircraft will be delivered early in summer 
2015 with the other one in February 2016. 
Ryanair currently only operates the Boeing 737 aircraft, a strategy that keeps down maintenance and pilot training 
costs. It has 303 in its fleet, plus the 180 now on order, meaning it is Boeing's biggest customer for the plane. The 
Boeing 737 competes with the Airbus A320 family of aircraft.
Airlines typically get discounts on the list prices put out by aircraft manufacturers. 
Ryanair shares were down 0.1% at EUR6.83 in London Wednesday.
